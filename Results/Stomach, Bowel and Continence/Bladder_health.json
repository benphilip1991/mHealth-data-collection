            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

It would be useful however if there was a remove button to delete any erroneous readings, so as not to corrupt the data and overall report. I noticed recently that the app frequently crashes when scrolling from right to left, which is annoying and sometimes during recording events. I also noticed that the duration time stated to the left of the graph and time on the x-axis don't match",

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"

            "Revised 9-16-20: I'm using the newer version of the app now. Hard to say which version since the app doesn't seem to show the version anywhere. The app now works on my Moto G5 - which is not officially supported. I understand that all phones can't be supported and I appreciate that the app still functions on my G5. But if this app just had a graph like the Privy app and if it reported total volume, I could verify the accuracy (cups with tubes of various sizes and known quantity of water to simulate voiding) by myself. This should at least be there as a seldom used \"calibration\" option. Another very odd issue is that the app provides no way to review past flows. Spot checking flow is all well and good, but I'd like to be able to spot trends. I want a graph like Privy had. The Privy scatter diagram was a great way to get an idea what was happening over time Heck, if proudP would just report a number, I could make my own graph. But no number. Just a bar graph and three ranges. No total flow. Really? With no numbers reported the best I can do is manually make my own graph using estimates from the proudP bar graph. Seems dumb considering my phone is a fairly sophisticated hand-held computer. Basically, I want the Privy app. Come on Soundable Health. Just let me run Privy on a Moto G5 or other Android phone and deliver the same warning that proudP delivers. t I guess it is on me at this point to just pony up and buy a phone that is supported. Seems a shame. Seems like Soundable Health is going to a lot of trouble to cripple their really nice technology. I just don't get it. Original Review : App provides no facility to agree to the terms of use. This leaves me stuck on a screen with a \"continue\" button that won't let me continue. I can only assume that there is a terms of use checkbox that is either hidden or off screen. So the app is useless on my Moto G5. BTW, the old Privy app worked fine on this phone for a few versions but the latest version refused to run. It's a shame sine the app is quite useful.",

The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit.

Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",

The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

UPDATE: called and was told that bluetooth interferes with connectivity - ok - turned off bluetooth - that seemed to work - THEN the app stalled out with no way to proceed as I was trying to input my CC info - what garbage - just another rush to market useless app from the graveyard of failed ideas that is Silicon Valley - maybe all of the homeless urine in San Francisco is interfering with their product - who knows - but I give this app -800/10.

            "Just started and seems easy and I could move up a couple of levels immediately I also have kegel balls that make it even more intense and you know you're doing it right by trying to pull the ball out the balls come with a pull tye so you can test how your muscles are getting stronger. I'm 68 years old and been doing kegel exercises for a while and I have complete control of my muscles so no accidents of not being able to hold my urine and having leaks which can be embarrassing.",
            "The app is super easy to use. I've been doing it for almost a month now and I can feel a difference! After having 3 kids, I can say that it has helped me to not pee every time I cough (sorry if that's too much information but it's reality!) And my husband is definitely a fan as well! The only thing I would say is that the easy workout was just too easy, is definitely recommend starting with medium or even going straight to the difficult setting.",
            "So easy couldn't help but keep playing like an interactive game. With technology's evergrowing pace, i always feel pressured for time and as if time is moving exponentially fast when really its not. That being said, this app gives my body another outlet to resort to when my mind needs to meditate and still feel useful.",
            "Just did my first workout.Can't complain of anything. Very simple design. But not hard to figure out. Could use a little more of a modern touch in the design department. But so far great praise for being easy and practical for the newcomer:)",
            "I like that it's easy to follow. And the voice activator directs you to do what you need to do."

        "description": "Kidneys\r\n\r\nConcomitant to their name, kidneys are positioned at the back of the abdominal cavity. Kidneys execute some very vital functions in the human body. These entail formation of urine, balancing chemicals and fluids in the body and extracting waste from the bloodstream. Moreover, they assist various other organs in carrying out routine functions in the body.\r\n\r\nThe pre-eminent functions of the kidneys are as follows\r\n\r\n1. Blood Pressure Regulation\r\nKidneys require a consistent flow of blood to filter it. In case the blood pressure drops, kidneys immediately begin increasing it. This is attained by the production of a vessel-constricting protein known as angiotensin. The kidneys produce this protein to regulate blood pressure and signal the body to retain water and sodium.\r\n\r\n2. Waste Excretion\r\nThe human body accumulates harmful elements such as toxins, urea and excess salts over time. Kidneys facilitate the excretion of these harmful elements by filtering the bloodstream.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain Water Levels\r\nKidneys adjust their function to the level of water intake. If in case the water intake drops, kidneys help retain water in the body instead of flushing it through urine.\r\n\r\n4. Acid Regulation\r\nThe body‚Äôs environment can get acidic if the kidneys do not perform their balancing function. Kidneys filter out toxins and metals that can lead to increased acidity.\r\n\r\n5. Red Blood Cell Stimulation\r\nLike every organ kidneys require proper oxygenation to keep up their activity. In case of oxygen, deficiency kidneys release erythropoietin which stimulates the bone marrow and increases the production of red blood cells.\r\n\r\nKidney health is extremely crucial for the human body. Healthy nutrient-dense foods are necessary to maintain proper kidney function.\r\n\r\nDiet has a close relation to kidney health. Deficiency of vital nutrients can be the cause of kidney diseases and kidney failure. People in the advanced stages of kidney disease need to adopt a kidney-friendly diet to prevent kidney failure. Diet requirements vary depending on the stage of kidney disease, however, eating foods low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus can altogether prevent any abnormality in the kidney function.\r\n \r\nIf You like The App Pls Rate it 5 stars!!!",

Could have went there myself and not needed this? Whole pack is a waste of packaging. Just a tiny pee stick and a colour board, that the app scans? Could have scanned it with my eyes if you wrote the info on the box.",

            "Bought and used the test - that part was the easy bit. Went back to Boots to show them the results and was told I have to make an appointment at the GP as the test alone isn't enough to get a prescription? I did state that the whole point of this was to avoid wasting a GP's time by bypassing them and was told the same. Don't waste your money - literally paid ¬£10 to be told you need to make a GP appt. Totally and utterly pointless.",
            "When i brought a kit from boots then i have followed the instructions by installing this app and then i have verified my number and after that the only thing i can see is a small yellow dot on the screen that's it. Have reinstalled this app for 5 times but no use",
            "I do everything the kit tells me to do and I get to the picture taking section and it says the room is to bright. Then to dark. Then it won't focus and then finally it takes the picture then it comes up with a message saying it needs to be taken again but when it brings me back to the camera it informs me that it's been 2 minutes and the test won't work no more .....so what? That's it? ¬£10 down the drain and left uncomfortable and just told to call a number. Just go to the doctors."

        "description": "Various bacterial infections in infants and children\r\n    Bacterial meningitis in infants older than 3 months\r\n    Acute articular rhumatism\r\n    Occult bacteremia and apparent source fever in infants and young children\r\n    Urinary tract infections in children\r\n\r\n1 Urinary tract infection is defined as the presence of ‚â• 5 √ó 104 colonies / mL in a urine sample collected by sampling or, in the older child, by repeated sampling with ‚â•105 colonies / mL. In young children, urinary tract infections are frequently associated with anatomical abnormalities. A urinary infection can cause fever, growth retardation, hypochondrial pain and signs of sepsis, especially in young children. The treatment is based on antibiotics. An imaging follow-up of the urinary tract is performed.\r\n\r\nUrinary tract infection can involve the kidneys and / or the bladder. Sexually transmitted infections of the urethra (eg, gonococcal or chlamydial urethritis), although involving the urinary tract, are not usually called urinary tract infections.\r\n\r\nMechanisms to maintain normal urinary tract sterility include urinary acidity, free flow of urine, normality of emptying mechanisms, ureteral and urethral valve integrity, immunological defenses, and mucosal barriers. An abnormality of one of these mechanisms predisposes to urinary tract infections.\r\nEtiology\r\n\r\nAt age 6, 3 to 7% of girls and 1 to 2% of boys had a urinary tract infection. The peak age of urinary tract infections is bimodal, with a peak in early childhood and another between the ages of 2 to 4 years (at the time of toilet training for many children). The girl-to-boy ratio ranges from 1: 1 to 1: 4 in the first 2 months of life (estimates vary, probably due to different proportions of uncircumcised male subjects in the study groups and the exclusion of infants with urologic abnormalities who are currently more frequently diagnosed in utero with prenatal ultrasound). The girl-to-boy ratio increases rapidly with age, approximately 2: 1 between 2 months and 1 year, 4: 1 in year 2, and> 5: 1 after 4 years. In girls, infections are usually ascending and less likely to cause bacteremia. The higher incidence of infections in girls beyond early childhood is attributed to the lower size of the female urethra and circumcision in boys.\r\n\r\nThe contributing factors in young children include\r\n\r\n    Malformations and obstructions of the urinary tract\r\n\r\n    Prematurity\r\n\r\n    Urinary catheters at home\r\n\r\n    In boys, no circumcision\r\n\r\nOther contributing factors in young children are constipation and Hirschsprung's disease.\r\n\r\nPredisposing factors in the older child include\r\n\r\n    Diabetes\r\n\r\n    Trauma\r\n\r\n    In women, sex\r\n\r\nUrinary tract abnormalities in children\r\n\r\nUrinary tract infections in children are markers of a possible urinary tract abnormality (eg, obstruction, neurogenic bladder, ureteral duplication); these abnormalities are particularly likely to lead to recurrent infections if vesico-ureteric reflux is present. About 20 to 30% of infants and young children aged 12 to 36 months who have a urinary tract infection have vesicoureteral reflux. The younger the child is during the first urinary tract infection, the greater the likelihood of vesicoureteral reflux. Vesico-ureteral reflux is classified by grade (classification by grade of vesicoureteral reflux *).",

            "Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.",
            "Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",
            "I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190",
            "Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",
            "Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support."

            "Great for those of us who forget we are doing Kegels and lose count! And you can adjust the Kegel sets to your ability. Love how it shows time spent on Kegels per day too. Haven't bought premium yet, but price seems reasonable to get more than one scheduled reminder a day if you're forgetful or don't feel like setting alarms on your phone. Also like the options on vibrate, bell, or no sound when it alternates between squeeze and rest.",
            "Really good for allowing you to personalise your workout and track. Free version is good enough for me, you need to pay to get multiple reminds in the day but 1 is enough. Only thing that would make it better is if it gave guidance in what routine is needed.",
            "I love the app... I've used it for just two weeks...I am pregnant and usually pee on myself while throwing but having used the app for just two weeks,I noticed I haven't peed on myself lately while throwing up. I am giving it 4stars because even after setting the alarm,it doesn't ever notify me, like i missed doing the exercise for two days cos I was busy, assuming I got an alarm,I won't have missed",
            "This is the best kegel app I've found. After trying out a few, I found this is the easiest to use and it gives you gentle reminders on when to exercise (¬£1.99 to have more than 1 reminder a day, but definitely worth it). Perfect for those experiencing the craziness of baby brain and just want something simple, easy and effective.",
            "Great app, which I use to prompt me while doing pelvic floor exercises while pregnant. I like the customisable options such as sound, vibrate and number of holds. Unfortunately the reminder does not seem to work. I have set it for 9pm each day but it never goes off, only goes off when I open the app anyway. Otherwise would be a 5 star worthy app."

The app needs to remember the level I'm working on and go directly to that level. And it's not clear how many repetitions you are to do.",

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Great app. Really helps me to remember when to do my pelvic floor exercises and there is a lot of extra info in here that I wasn't expecting. Only one glitch that others have also identified, it doesn't always notify you but I have discovered you have to open the notifications and not just clear them by doing this, the app works perfectly.",
            "As others have said it will go weeks without any notification and then suddenly several will come through randomly at the same time. Defeats the purpose of having the app when that is pretty much the sole purpose. I saw they replied to someone 12 months ago saying they're working on a fix. You would think after a year they would have come up with a fix by now...",
            "The reminders stop working, or pile up suddenly. There is some very strange text on the introduction page that sounds like bad translation. The app is very hard to follow. It should be more intuitive. It keeps asking me to set it up.",
            "The reminders stop working for me every three days, and only stay working again when I go bank into the app. I was constantly forgetting to do my exercises so I've just set reminders on my phone instead. Hopefully they can fix this.",

            "It has stopped working properly. If you are exercising outdoors and it has stopped working, even the steps stop being recorded. Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. When a gallstone blocks the bile duct, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic (gallbladder attack) can result. This happens in 1‚Äì4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), jaundice, and infection of a bile duct (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. \r\nRisk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms.

Mine vanished without a trace, leaving me with needing a prescription renewal and the only way to get one was to spend another $175 on finding a new provider in the app. What's the point if you have no doctors continuity? And if this happens only occasionally, why wasn't I informed? Absolute trash -- find a better platform than this for yourself, honestly.",
            "I really like this app, it's pretty user friendly, I've always been connected to a doctor in under 10 mins, they have a large selection of doctors to choose from and the doctors have all been really awesome. They accept my anthem blue cross so I've never had to pay out of pocket. Great job!",
            "Tried using the app for the first time today. Selected a dr, entered all my info, waited for about 15 mins to get connected just to have the video not work & the Dr end the session. Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This app has changed the game for me when it comes to going to the pharmacy. Whenever my girlfriend sick (or myself) I just put in the symptoms and it gives me medicine that will help with every symptom I have. I'm no longer having to buy five different medicines at the same time. Not only that it gives me the location where this medicine might be my local pharmacy. And the prices so I can go get the cheapest one. It also has Amazon prices in case I want to buy a lot at once if I need to use the medicine frequently. And unlike WebMD or something like that it doesn't make me feel like I have some rare disease, it gives me something country I can work with that actually helps solve my problem instead of worrying about it. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "Good app to spend money. I've tried some apps like this before but I found the app's benefit. This one is better than the others. My outstanding features and beyond my imagination. I really love it.",
            "Works all the time. I had a prescription that was well over $170 and OTCme saved the day, I only paid just under $11 for it! Thank you this tool! I highly recommend trying this app and seeing the difference for yourselves!",
            "Excellent software. After only a month of use it has saved me more than $100 with Pharmacy Coupon. Not only that but the app is well designed and easy to navigate. Cannot recommend highly enough. Let try it.",
            "Thanks for this useful app. I have nothing to complain about this app because this one is super great. This app is proof that the simplest ideas are the best ones. There is no fuss or hassle, just start trying new buying medicine experience"

            "Got my Elvie today, installed the app and did 2 workouts. Generally a great product and a good app to go with it. Haven't used it long enough to experience any difficulties. Major minus (or I didn't find it yet) is that I can't seem to see my stats and track my workouts. That defeats the purpose a little ;)",
            "1) bad, constant, disconnections when in use 2) some goals have a try-again option (lift, strength). Need that for pulse too. 3) the combination above make it practically useless! 4) Can't quit the app, or a practice routine. If i kill it - it becomes useless until reboot. 5) Notification from other app (e.g. a group whatsapp chat) cause the trsining routine to rewind back to 0, becoming an endless loop of lift.",
            "I've set notifications for a specific time, but the app doesn't notify me at the time I've set. So i have notifications going off at random times including very late and very early morning."

            "Incredibly fast and affordable! I was talking to a Dr. in less than 30 minutes and he called in my prescription. Another 30 minutes and it was ready to be picked up and I never left my couch! No insurance needed, doesn't matter if there's a pre-existing condition, no need for video, just took a pic. Only $10 a visit!",
            "Wasnt able to help me medically which wasnt a big deal, but then I had multiple charges on my credit card and just found more the next month. Horrible customer service over the phone. If they charge me again next month I would rather get a new card and change all my autopay rather than deal with them again.",
            "Medek is fantastic! Getting sick is always inconvenient, but the process of taking off work, driving to the doctor and waiting around in their sick room just to get a diagnosis is the literal definition of adding insult to injury. Being able to get diagnosed from wherever I am without having to do all of that is such a relief that I'd happily pay twice what Medek costs just to avoid the hassle that getting sick causes. Great app, even better service. I cannot recommend it strong enough."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

        "description": "How to Do Kegel Exercises for Men\r\nIf you do Kegel exercises on a regular basis, then you can substantially strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. By having strong pelvic floor muscles, you may be able to reduce urinary and bowel incontinence and improve your sexual health.[1] Before you begin practicing the exercises regularly, you must learn how to do them correctly. If you are unsure, then contact your doctor. Like any exercise, start out slowly and gradually increase your stamina over time.Do Kegel exercises before receiving treatment for prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises\r\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles--in both men and women--that support your spine, help control your bladder, and help with sexual functions. By identifying your pelvic floor, performing Kegels (a popular pelvic floor exercise), and practicing other pelvic floor exercises, you can rehabilitate these muscles. In time, you can gain the benefits of a strong pelvic floor, including reduced urinary incontinence, less back pain, more control of your core, and better sex.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Women\r\nKegel exercises can improve your sex life and help with pelvic floor problems, including urinary and fecal incontinence. The key is to get in the habit of doing them every day so you start to see results.\r\n\r\nKegel Exercise Description and Routines\r\nBasic Kegel Exercise Descriptions\r\nBeginner Kegel Exercise Routine\r\nIntermediate Kegel Exercise Routine\r\n\r\nHow to Do Reverse Kegels\r\nKegels are well known for their ability to tighten the pelvic floor, reduce incontinence, improve sexual enjoyment, and help with childbirth. Reverse kegels can also help with these goals. Each time you do a reverse kegel, you relax, lengthen, and stretch the pelvic floor, which may help to relieve pain or tension in the area. Men and women can perform reverse kegels, and you can do them anywhere without any special equipment!\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Pregnant Women\r\nKegel exercises, like other exercises, help strengthen muscles. The muscles that are strengthened by the Kegel exercises are located in the lower section of the pelvic region and are responsible for holding the pelvic organs in place as well as controlling the flow of urine from the body.[1] Both of these are important for pregnant women. Due to the increased size of the uterus and the weight of the growing baby, this area of the body is under stress, which can sometimes lead to bladder leakage and other issues, To do Kegel exercises, you will need to find the muscles and then practice engaging them.\r\n\r\nHow to Treat and Prevent Incontinence with Kegel Exercises\r\nKegel exercises can strengthen a woman's pelvic muscles and ligaments. For best results, more than three sets of Kegel exercises should be done every day.\r\n\r\nHow to Do PC Muscle Exercises\r\nThe pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the muscle that stretches from your pubic bone to the bottom of your spine. Strengthening the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle can help both sexes treat urinary and fecal incontinence, as well. PC muscle exercises are easy daily exercises that will help strengthen your PC muscle.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises: A how-to guide for women\r\nHere's a step-by-step guide to doing Kegel exercises correctly.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men: Understand the benefits\r\nKegel exercises for men can help improve bladder control \r\n\r\nKegel exercises (also called ‚Äúpelvic floor exercises‚Äù) strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.\r\n\r\nWhat are Kegel exercises?\r\nWhy do Kegel exercises?\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in women\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in men\r\nGoals and benefits of Kegel exercises\r\nHOW KEGEL EXERCISES WORK\r\nHOW TO DO KEGEL EXERCISES - A STEP BY STEP GUIDE\r\nSIGNS OF PELVIC FLOOR STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star and share it with your family and friends. via rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

            "In response to PlopüòÄ Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "So far the experience has been very positive. The reminders are much more constant compared to other apps (which i like since i forget to drink water easily) and being able to select diferent kinds of beverages is a huge plus.",
            "Good design, easy to use, good challenges, BUT after a while it becomes slow day by day and you have to clear all the data",
            "After a while, it is getting slower. Enter your drink, wait for the sum to update, wait for the next drink time to update, wait for the animation. Wonder what it's doing. Edit: Reinstalling fixed the lag at the cost of all records. A pity, but those records are of little consequence anyway. Next time I will try to just clear all data from the settings, maybe that will have the same effect. Edit 2: Using it for a few more months and the slowness is back. So it's time for a new flush. Bye badges",
            "So far I've been really happy with this app and may consider the purchase upgrade if I find I stick with logging my fluid intake. My kidneys are currently thanking me as I've never drank so much water on a daily basis as I have in the past 5 days. With this app, I find I often drink my intake before required but on the occasion I got behind in my schedule... I really appreciated the app's reminder. Update 9/9/2020. I use this app every day. I always meet my goals. May actually become a habit!",
            "Great app with nice graphics. It's satisfying for me to drink more than 5 glass of water per day. With help of this app now i am drinking 10-12 glass of water and i like it. Challenges feature of this app is also a great tool to stay on your target."

            "Update2: Keyboard issue is fixed! Update: Had to take off a star because the keyboard covers the note field, so it's hard to see what I'm typing. I like at all the buttons are near the bottom because I often am using the app with one hand, and I do appreciate that many of the forms are automatically filled out from the last event. Saves me a lot of tapping. Great idea on the poop color indicator. I'm wondering, though, is there any way to import data from a CSV export from another app?",
            "The app was has been very useful since my son was born. It allowed my wife and I to coordinate through the night and know at all times how the baby was doing. I would have given 5 stars until the addition of the intrusive advertisements. Most of the ads are full screen, come with a timer and can't be closed. I don't have time to deal with those annoying ads with a newborn in my arms. The developers should consider adding a paid version without ads. I would gladly pay for it.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

        "description": "The Kegel Exercise (also referred to as the Pelvic Floor Exercise) is the action of repetitive contraction of the pubococcygeus (P.C.) muscles. If you‚Äôve ever stopped yourself from urinating midstream, you‚Äôve used your PC muscles. If you flex your PC muscles and hold them in a contracted position for ten seconds through a series of reps you are then partaking in the Kegel exercise. Originally used for women to control incontinence (the urge to urinate all the time) and to enhance sexual responses during intercourse, the Kegel Exercise is now also being used by men.\r\n\r\nHow to do Kegel Exercises\r\nLocate the right muscles\r\nInsert a finger inside your anus and squeeze the surrounding muscles. You can feel the PC muscle tighten or move upward when you contract it. Then, relax your muscles and feel your pelvic floor return to the starting position.\r\n\r\nAlso try to stop the flow of urine when you urinate. Don‚Äôt do this on an extremely full bladder.\r\nPractice Makes Perfect\r\nContract your pelvic floor muscles, hold the contraction for five seconds, and then relax for five seconds. Practice it five to six times in a row. Work up to keeping the muscles contracted for ten seconds at a time, and then relax for another ten seconds between each contraction.\r\nFocus While Exercising\r\nTo have a faster result in a shorter period of time, focus your mind on tightening your pelvic floor muscles only. Do not flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs or buttocks. Breathe normally and avoid holding your breath.\r\nRepeat 3 times a day\r\nPractice at least three sets of ten repetitions a day. After a while, you‚Äôll be able to exercise your PC muscles seamlessly. You‚Äôll even be able to do them while doing your daily chores!\r\nThe Kegel exercise has been shown to promote vast improvement in the health of the penis. In excess, however, the exercise can also be very harmful. The reason for this is because over-contraction of the prostate muscle triggers the prostate's sympathetic nerve to induce an ejaculation. Never perform the Kegel with an extremely full bladder. Overworking the PC muscle for a long period of time would weaken it and result in premature ejaculation or seminal leakage.\r\n \r\nPeople with weak prostates or exhausted prostate should be taking prostate care formula with Kegel to have a better ejaculation control results. Weakened bladders can be strengthened with herbs for bladder, which improves bladder elasticity.",

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user ü•≤",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

        "title": "Hepatitis B: Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management & Hepatitis B Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

            "Terrible at counting the number of steps I take. Records between 50%-90% of the steps that Google fit records, which is impressive; seeing as the app is supposed to sync with Google fit, I'm not sure why it would have a different record. Feels much less accurate than any other pedometer I've used. I do like the achievements and levels offered, but they're pretty pointless if the number of steps in taking isn't recorded accurately.",
            "I really enjoy this app I've been using it for around a year maybe more now and I have had no problems with it. It counts my steps fairly accuratly I would say and has features where you can log the amount of watter you drink each day as well as other lings like weight loss tracking and if you pay for it you can get workout plans and other stuff (I don't but its an option if you are interested). Also it gives little celebrations when you meet your goal which is fun.",
            "It's a cute app. I love how it encourages you with confetti when you reach half way. A lot of people have the Fitbit but frankly I can't afford one. I'm a broke college student and covid has me up to 200lbs. I need to shape up and this is free and from what I can tell so far there aren't many ads.",
            "I really enjoy the app, but there is one thing bothering me. I have my phone with me when walking the dog and have reached the highest level (Lvl. 9) within only a few months. I really wish the leveling system would be extended by a few awards, say 1M steps, 3M and so on and so forth. I've only been using the app for less than 10 months and have already went ca. 1,6M steps",
            "Mega Excellent app!!!!! I just need some functions in this app: 1) Can you make this app useful for some kids. 2) Make this app in maps like taking distance from a school to a garden like make a way from one place to another. 3) Set a setting like measuring room, going up a down by stairs or slopes by telling the app. So these a are my several updates for this app please update app including these functions. Please please please please please. üòÖüòÜüò¢"

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

Not even serious to even look to the review. Well done samsung",

Such as listening to music without my phone üòç‚ù§. Adding my pictures from my gallery. The more I use it the better it becomes. October 14, 2020 brings new challenges with this watch. I charged it last night & in the morning after a few hours, it's completely dead. Can't do my morning workout üò´. Taking away 1 star.",

So disappointing... I have unistalled everything and re-installed them back. Everything was switched off and on. Did all the tricks. Nothing works.",
            "Love how small but complete the watch is. Battery life is good. Swim results need some work but it does a good job detecting strokes. It doesnt record kicking or drills. Cant wait to use it for running and weight training! I loved the Gear FitPro and was not looking to spend 500 dollars for a watch that does the same as this one, worth the buy. Only gripe is the music app cant import YouTube music or spotify. That needs to be fixed on the phone Samsung music app sucks.",

            "A wonderful app. I have covid19 and no doctors in my area will see me but because of the MD Live I am able to get the care and meds to help me.",
            "First time. Video quality was like typical for video chats - not sufficient for the Dr to diagnose anything visually, a photo is necessary. FYI, I was told that the wait would be 15 minutes or less and the video call came immediately as did a text message and a voice call telling me that I was in the queue - so that was a little annoying but I'm glad the service was very responsive!",
            "1st time using an app like this, I was skeptical, I was also desperate. Instead of waiting for open enrollment for medical insurance, this app is a Blessing to say the least. It was fast! & My prescription was at my neighborhood pharmacy in less than an hour! Thank you to the M.D. that helped me! And thank God for this app! Highly recommend ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
            "Freaking Awesome!!! No need to go into a doctor's office. Just video chat or phone call with an doctor, therapist or psychiatrist. The average wait time is minutes and you are in the comfort of your home, I was sitting at my desk at work. What a great app and company. Super excited !!!",
            "I love MDLive for it's convenience but I do question why there isn't an option for reoccurring appointments or a way that I didn't have to fill out the appointment request information weekly for my therapy visits. It's rather annoying that every week I have to fill out the information rather than just confirming the repeat appointment my therapist has set up. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars, and I have recommended this app to many friends of mine because I do find it to be amazing."

            "This app used to be great, recording steps, bike rides and transport with reasonable accuracy. Now it has thrown me out and forced me to become a new user and I have lost all previous data (even with the same user name) plus now does not record calories correctly saying I hardly use any when excersizing. Extremely dissapointed and need something better that does what this used to do.",
            "No stars if I could!.... Rubbish....Now stopped working all together except for the occasional heart beat record. My smartband appears to be working but the app is not up dating the info, which is a shame because I can find nothing else that works with my smart band, which is still fully functioning. So very frustrating.... 19-07-2019 original review, Would like to give it more but it no longer records when I am in the car, I frequently walk a 2 & half hour car journey",
            "Edit, October 2020: The last update deleted all my data. Sony have no pride. Don't buy their products. Original review, March 2020: I have been using Lifelog for 12 months. In the start I felt it was a good app. At the time it was certainly one of the best life-loggers that logged steps, sleep, weight and calory burn in a single app. Over time it has become more and more unstable, especially the last couple of months. Counting from the start of 2020 I have registered 9 days where the app did not count any steps at all. That means that the step-counter counts 0 steps approximately one day each week. This means that the statistics that shows the numbers of steps each week, each month etc is always much lower than you would expect. It is not possible to input manual corrections. If manual corrections were made possible the errors would just be annoying, but without this functionality the app is useless.",
            "Somehow managed to walk 4km taking only 338 steps... Seems the step counter is a little inaccurate! Two years later no improvement - now not syncing with swr30 or recording any steps or location data... Pretty much useless unless u want to track only your sleep! And another two years later, more of the same.. Worked for a bit, now not counting or syncing steps from swr30.",
            "Still tracking steps but not tracking sleep since I updated the app. It tracks how long I've slept but not how much light or deep sleep I've had, it just says I'm awake all the time! It's a real shame as there doesn't seem to be an alternative app so does that mean my smartband is obsolete?"

            "Your health key is excellent site , doctors as well as front desk top staff is very cooperative, response very fast, doctor prescribe less medicine having maximum efficacy, so I think best treatment option on this site, I think everything is already best nothing to improve.",
            "My experience with the app was extremely satisfying. My consultation with Dr. Ajmera Singh at Your Health Key worked as expected. The doctor was quick to respond, he was able to diagnose my condition and accordingly prescribed me medications. I had a great session with the doc and I'm totally satisfied with the service. Highly recommended app indeed. 5 stars to the app..",
            "Doctor is well experienced and have patience to listen. I felt like I was in hospital and talking to Doctor in person",

            "Tried lots of water tracking apps. This is the most customizable and nicest looking one! It has your history on a chart so you can compare days. You can go back and edit past days if you forgot something. Easy to add different size drinks for all the glasses and bottles in your house. I like the notifications. I've been struggling with dehydration and some bad side effects from that. This app has helped me remember to drink more water and take care of my health. Thank you!",
            "Makes it easy to drink more liquid throughout the day, and has lots of options for glass sizes so I don't have to worry about figuring out what a partial glass might be worth.",
            "Great app! I use it every single day! I was chronically dehydrated for years, but no more!!",
            "This is a great app. I was using Drink Water, but the constant ads were killing me and it didn't offer a premium version so I got this. I feel like it is actually more accurate, and without the annoyance of ads for just $2.99 is worth it to me. I highly recommend it.",
            "Nicely watered. Great app to record your consumption of water through out the day. If you lead a busy and hetic life whilst at work the app will remind you to drink depending on your settings. The alerts also appear on my Galaxy S3 watch so there is no excuse for forgetting. Keep up the good work."

            "Was a great app until recently. Today I ran twice period first time for 1.42 MI. I held the stock button so you can record and instead it just kept spinning around. I had to restart the app and lose my run data from this morning. I ran again this afternoon. 1.05 MI. Again, press and hold the stop button to record my data, the wheel o death reappeared again and after 2 minutes, the app restarted again without recording any data. Participating in challenges and now this is happening.",
            "Is alright app, but this morning went for a run with my wife who uses the same app. Hers app was off by 500m on a 10km run compare to mine. We know were are 1km marks etc, not the first time this happened. We also use different phones to track. My Samsung is most of the time on the dot, same as hers iPhone. But time to time iPhone is delaying actual progress.",
            "This app has made me into an actual runner. I used to only run on the treadmill at the gym, but when covid closed them all, I found this app and started running outside. The coaches and guided runs are dope, and challenges with my friends and others around the world keep me engaged. I bought a treadmill and still use this to track my runs and do challenges with the homies in different parts of the world!",
            "Great app & features. Only problem- there is a bug in Coach mode when the NTC app workouts are not syncing back into NRC as well as Intervall runs are not saved as a run on the running plan. So about half of my Plan's workouts are not saved into My plan and therefore are not taking under consideration for my progress.",
            "I have been using this app for more than 5 years now. Since a month, I am facing a lot of issues with this app. Some runs are not recorded and GPS is not being used for tracking my runs leading to inaccurate distances. I am using Samsung S8."

After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",

The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",

This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Great app. I waited till after I was done with the 21 day challenge to review. I did the challenge everyday and I did this with 5 bottles of water and intermittent fasting as well. After the 3rd week I added 35 to 45 min of treadmill and very light lifting 3x a week. I've only been on the scale once. So far I've been feeling amazing no more bloating. My family has noticed my weight loss. I've lost 5 lbs. It's not much but it's a start. Love the app!",
            "I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ‚ô°.",
            "The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw",
            "I've been using for a couple weeks and I really like how simple and easy this app is...gives me no excuse not to work out bc most workouts are just 10mins! I am doing the full body 28 day challenge and it's actually really enjoyable. I feel good after the work out and want to do at least one more. Really enjoyable women's fitness app. Not to much and not to little. Just right for this mom. üíÉ",
            "If your somebody who is having trouble during the pandemic and feeling a bit of bloating then download this app!! It amazing. It keeps up with your workouts, your diet, and let's you pick what part of your body you want to exercise with or just stretch. It does a lot for you and gives you reminders for when to work out. Download it!!üî•üî•"

        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from theories related to osteoporosis research, however, most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, with the proposal that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, and low energy levels as well as other illnesses. Human blood is regulated at pH 7.35 to 7.45. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkaloids and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious, and the body has acid‚Äìbase homeostasis mechanisms that generally ensure this does not happen. The idea that these diets can materially affect blood pH for the purpose of treating a range of diseases is not supported by scientific research and makes incorrect assumptions about how alkaline diets function that are contrary to human physiology.\r\n\r\nDiets avoiding meat, poultry, cheese, and grains can be used in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH). However, difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of this diet have led to medications, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH. The \"acid-ash\" hypothesis was once considered a risk factor for osteoporosis, though the current weight of scientific evidence does not support this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nMedical aspects:\r\nAccording to the traditional hypothesis underlying this diet, acid ash is produced by meat, poultry, cheese, fish, eggs, and grains. Alkaline ash is produced by fruits and vegetables, except cranberries, prunes and plums.

This is a need to urinate that is so strong you can't reach the toilet in time.\r\nPelvic floor weakness due to childbirth. Childbirth can stretch and weaken pelvic floor muscles. And that can cause urine control problems. It can also allow one or more pelvic organs to sag. When the uterus sags, it's called uterine prolapse. Women can help prevent this problem by doing daily Kegels during and after pregnancy.\r\n\r\nHow to do Kegel exercises\r\n\r\nKegels are easy to do and can be done anywhere without anyone knowing.\r\nFind the muscles you use to stop urinating.\r\nSqueeze these muscles for 3 seconds. Then relax for 3 seconds. Your stomach and thigh muscles should not tighten when you do this.\r\nAdd 1 second each week until you are able to squeeze for 10 seconds each time.\r\nRepeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session. Try to do this at least 3 times a day.\r\nDon't do Kegels while you urinate. Doing them during urination can hurt your bladder.\r\nKegels work best when done on a regular schedule.\r\n\r\nYour doctor may want you to try doing Kegels with biofeedback.

            "It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this programüëçüèªKUDOS TO YOU‚ùó",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

            "Love the app. Noticed a couple bugs. Low Side Plank L is associated with the low plank leg lifts audio. On a training plan, round announcements after the first and before the the last are weird and seem like a concurrency issue. An example is, \"Round Squats 2 40 seconds,\" where it should probably be, \"Round 2, Squats, 40 seconds.\"",
            "Runtastic decided to kill all their apps (including paid versions) in exchange for this all in one dumpster app, which collects way more of your personal data in exchange for much poorer functionality. The cycling exercise is useless for MTB, since it only reads gps data so often so all your turns and curls are recorded as a straight line. The push-ups tracker.... wait... there is none, only the dude showing you how to do push ups(seriously?) no counters, no trackers, no goals to set & reach",
            "The app is great up until it crashes or you get a new phone requiring a reinstall causing any progress pics along with your past weight stats to be lost thus making the option of progress pics pointless. Pretty annoying I can't store the images in the cloud along with the workouts especially if you're paying for the app. Really would be 5 stars but this is now the second time I've lost all progress pics. You're better off just logging your own stats and taking photos with your regular camera app",
            "Paid for the membership version. I like the ability to set reminders and hit what are pretty challenging workouts. My problem is some workouts don't issue out breaks... which seems pretty unreasonable considering the amount of work from the previous set. Another issue I notice is the cool down stretches are the same workout after workout regardless of what exercises you just did... I.e. a focused core/ab workout should not need to focus on the same cool down stretches as lunge heavy workouts."

        "title": "Alkaline Diet Plan",
        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from the acid ash hypothesis, which primarily related to osteoporosis research. Most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, who propose that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and other illnesses.

        "descriptionHTML": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from the acid ash hypothesis, which primarily related to osteoporosis research. Most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.<br><br>These diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, who propose that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and other illnesses. Human blood is maintained between pH 7.35 and 7.45 by acid‚Äìbase homeostasis mechanisms. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkalosis and levels below 7.35 as acidosis.

            "I was excited to use this app. It lets you track fsh, lh, and pdg if you buy those strips separate and have the app activated for it. I have used this for 3 months. The one cycle I did pdg it did not chart accurately. Two other cycles have been wasted as it wrongly shifted my predicted fertile period and ovulation way after both my hormone levels dropped. Tech support replied quickly and said it will be fixed in future update, which has not happened yet. Meanwhile, I wasted money on 2 kits now.",
            "Pearl claims to be helpful if you have abnormal cycles and PCOS. One thing I'm really disappointed about in this app is that if your cycle is longer than 30 days, you stop seeing your hormone results on the graph. Kind of defeats the purpose of measuring. They will provide the graph if asked, but this can take time and you may have missed peaks by waiting",
            "I love these tests and the app, but since the latest update it it doesn't want to open my camera and the timer didn't work.",
            "Incredibly disappointed, paid close to $60 on Amazon for the test kit and the freaking app doesn't work. Searched the website for customer service and found nothing except for a very unhelpful FAQ section.",

        "description": "As many as 1 out of 3 men say they experience premature ejaculation, or finishing sooner than they (and their partners) would like. In some cases, this can be a sign of erectile dysfunction, but in most cases it is embarrassing and leads to feelings of sexual inadequacy. While this condition can often be treated with medication, there are ways you can improve your sexual performance without requiring medical treatment. Changing up your sexual routine, practicing foreplay, and taking steps to relax beforehand are all examples of ways you can teach yourself to last longer in bed naturally.\r\n\r\nHow to Make ejaculation Last Longer\r\nReaching climax faster than your partner is common, so don‚Äôt get down on yourself. Fortunately, most people who climax quickly can learn how to last longer. Exercises and lifestyle changes can help improve control, and there are lots of climax-delaying techniques you could try during sex. Climax control products and medications could also be worth a shot. If your partner finishes too soon, try to approach the topic as a team. Avoid placing blame, and let them know that you want to work together to build physical and emotional intimacy.\r\n\r\nHow to Improve Sexual Stamina\r\nEveryone wants to be a better lover. For many, especially men, inability to offer one's partner a lasting sexual experience is a source of concern and even stress. However avoiding premature ejaculation in men and lack of sexual stamina in either partner can be easy with the right set of bedroom techniques and lifestyle changes. Here are some steps to help boost your bedroom game and ensure satisfaction for both you and your partner.\r\n\r\nHow to Control Premature Ejaculation\r\nPremature ejaculation occurs when a man orgasms during sex sooner than he or his partner would like. Criteria for diagnosing this condition include that the man nearly always ejaculates within one minute of penetration or is almost never able to delay ejaculation. For most men the average time until ejaculation is about five minutes. Premature ejaculation affects many men and can lead to them feeling frustrated and embarrassed. Some men even try to avoid sexual intimacy because of it. However, it is treatable through counseling, using sexual techniques to delay ejaculation, and medications. By addressing the issue, you and your partner can enjoy sex.\r\n\r\nHow to Do PC Muscle Exercises\r\nThe pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the muscle that stretches from your pubic bone to the bottom of your spine. Strengthening the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle can help both sexes treat urinary and fecal incontinence, as well as helping men avoid erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. PC muscle exercises are easy daily exercises that will help strengthen your PC muscle.\r\n\r\nHow to Maintain an Erection\r\nHow Men Can Last Longer In Bed Naturally\r\nCan Men Last Longer In Bed Without Taking Pills?\r\nCan Supplements Help Men Last Longer In Bed?\r\nCan Specific Exercises Help Men During Sex?\r\nThis results from performance anxiety, stress, premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction (losing erection during sex).\r\n\r\nHow to Easily Last 20 Minutes or Longer in Bed\r\nWhy would I want to last longer?\r\nyoung men without much sexual experience\r\nnew relationships, or with a new sexual partner\r\nmen who don‚Äôt have sex regularly\r\nNot lasting long enough is only a problem when it becomes a regular or an extreme thing.\r\nHow to Last Longer in Bed Using the Disassociation Technique\r\nWhether you are suffering from Premature Ejaculation or Erectile Dysfunction, or you want to lasting longer.\r\n\r\nHow to last longer in bed ‚Äî lifestyle changes for better sex\r\nSimple Tips, Tricks and Techniques to Help You Last Longer in Bed\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star and share it with your family and friends",

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2√ó boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "My daughter and I both love this app for when we are struggling to get to sleep or are wakeful in the night. My daughter is 9 now but we have been using these meditations since she was a toddler. It's not just for kids either - as a shift worker my sleep patterns are all over the place, but a gentle familiar story with its soothing music can get me off to sleep when I need to.",
            "I love his app, before i got this, i couldnt get to sleep at all. But now i have it im aslepp within minuites. This app is perfect for people who struggle to sleep at night. Its amazing. 10/10. One thing i would add. Though. Is that you could rewind the video while its paused. Otherwise, its a great app!",
            "Used this with my daughter when she has some anxiety at bedtime (she is 8) and it helped alot! Thank you. Simple imaginative ideas like putting worries in a balloon and letting them float away along with muscle relaxation worked for her. We appreciate the effort that has gone into this app and it has helped. Thanks üôÇ",
            "This app has several free bedtime relaxation/meditation recordings to choose from. Since it takes longer than a few minutes for my 7-year-old to sleep, we use the 15-minute one. He's asleep in 12 min - even me - if I listen! Earlier, I played bedtime story apps. My son would listen to a few of them (lasting at times 60+ minutes). Bedtime stories are great to listen to, but not to relax the mind. They keep a child up as s/he listens to the end and another begins.",
            "Have I used it enough? Not Yet! But loving my first 2 sessions, with the kids. My kids love it. I highly recommend to any family that love to read to their kids. Life get so busy we often forget to unwind in that golden moment before bedtime. This App is great reminder to unwind xx"

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

Blue Cross should use the $10,000 a year I pay them in insurance premiums to make an app that works!!!!!!",

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq üôèüôè",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

My insurance guarantees that every visit is free which is even better! No office visit costs, just cost of medication! You will not regret downloading it!",
            "With my insurance I have a $0 copay. I‚Äôve met the most understanding and educated doctors. They truly listen to me, and take time out of there day to explain things. I‚Äôve used this app for appointments probably 10-20 times now for everything from pink eye to emergency refills. They can always send in orders for bloodwork or testing at facilities like Quest if needed. Never had problems with prescriptions not being filled at my pharmacy. This place saves time and money!",
            "Very pleased with the service. 5 minute wait time. No lines or having to wait in the waiting area with numerous other sick people. The doctor was very pleasant and informative of my issue. I was even able to stay in my pajamas for my visit! So much nicer then having to go in to the clinic. I give them a 5 star all the way!!"

            "Typical google chaotic mess... Google dumps apps, replacement to come at some point in the future... Don't hold your breath! Buy an app on your phone... Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

        "title": "Kegel Exercise for Men & Women -Step-by-Step Guide",
        "description": "Kegel exercise, also known as pelvic-floor exercise, involves repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, now sometimes colloquially referred to as the \"Kegel muscles\". The exercise can be performed multiple [quantify] times each day, for several minutes at a time, but take one to three months to begin to have an effect.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises aim to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. These muscles have many functions within the human body. In women, they are responsible for: holding up the human bladder, preventing urinary stress incontinence (especially after childbirth), vaginal and uterine prolapse. In men, these muscles are responsible for: urinary continence, fecal continence, and ejaculation. Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men: Understand the benefits\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men can help improve bladder control and possibly improve bed performance. Here's a guide to doing Kegel exercises correctly.\r\n\r\nThink Kegel exercises are just for women? Think again.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men can strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder and bowel and affect stamina function. With practice, Kegel exercises for men can be done just about anytime.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises: A how-to guide for women\r\n\r\nKegel exercises can prevent or control urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor problems. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing Kegel exercises correctly.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the uterus, bladder, small intestine and rectum. You can do Kegel exercises, also known as pelvic floor muscle training, just about anytime.\r\n\r\nBefore you start doing Kegel exercises, find out how to locate the correct muscles and understand the proper technique.\r\nKegel exercises can help make the muscles under the uterus, bladder, and bowel (large intestine) stronger. They can help both men and women who have problems with urine leakage or bowel control. You may have these problems:\r\n\r\n    As you get older\r\n    If you gain weight\r\n    After pregnancy and childbirth\r\n    After gynecologic surgery (women)\r\n    After prostate surgery (men)\r\n\r\nPeople who have brain and nerve disorders may also have problems with urine leakage or bowel control.\r\nWhat Are Kegels, and Why Should I Do Them?\r\nKegel exercises (also called ‚Äúpelvic floor exercises‚Äù) strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. These muscles support your uterus, bladder, small intestine, and rectum.

Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

            "Sleep tracker: begins recording \"sleep\" while I'm still awake. Would be nice to have a manual override, or clear instructions on how to set a preferred time. Graph line is difficult to decipher; any possibilities on variations, like the watch faces? Something more clear to read? A report of 8hrs 34mn sleep, does match the actual 6hrs 20 minutes I was actually in my bed... Kind of a big problem for accuracy.",
            "It's decent, but it really lacks in the customization for the watch itself. For example, I believe the Quick View settings are for notifications. Being able to adjust the font size and the duration they remain visible would be great, but is absent. Also it seems to disregard repeated notifications (won't show them if they ever repeat). This is a problem if you are using this for a security system that might ping you when a door has been opened.",
            "It has huge potentials but it seems they're not working on this App to improve. Connected to Crossbeats or some more devices but Several Data is not precision neither in-depth. Still they've not released the Beta. This App needs regular updations and patches. Android App is not connecting with Google Fit. Imagine this App doesn't share the data with Google Fit. Not at all a worth Apps to come with a smart watch worth Rs5K or more. This App is killing the Devices with its potential.",
            "So much potential, but some flaws and the watches need work. The sleep timer keeps turning off between 8-9 am despite the fact I go to bed around 3-4 and get up later. The continuous HR monitoring needs work too. The app is really clean and nice though. The sleep graph is the nicest I have seen, but the HR needs work. I really wish the phones that use it were better, they seem to be highly inaccurate. Being able to use other phones would be nice too.",
            "The reason for the 3 stars is 1 reason but a big one, it doesn't sync to Google, please can this be made to feed in to Google fit? I'm on a specific health plan that is tracked by consultants using platforms that can feed from Google. I didn't know about that when I bought the watch which I've grown to like. Also so far the app is 5 star on my experience, except the above 1 failing. Please link it in to Google, would much prefer to give 5 stars."

        "description": "Feeling run down with everyday stresses? Pressure points are a great way to release nerve endings and ease tension in the body for all over spiritual and physical comfort.

I don't care about following goals, I \njust need to follow my measurements like heart rate, blood pressure, etc \nand compare the results + the graph export worked for me to print the \nresults when I'm going to my cardiologyst. This app was best for my needs \nand now it's useless after the update... It's like every other app out \nthere. Don't change apps like this, it's a total waste of our time.",
            "The old versions was 200 times better. None of the screens shown are on the \napp.",
            "Useful app to keep track of different health measurements. Would be cool if there would be a view to show a list of measurements for one specific measurement. The calendar view is not that useful for me as I don't measure every day. Perhaps the calendar view could optionally leave out days without measurements. One other thing is that in my country different units are used for blood tests, so the units should be configurable.",
            "Great app. Does exactly what it needs to do. Only one criticism, which could make the app even better is to increase the text size on the x and y axis so it can be read or to do a pinch to zoom feature so text can be read.",

Pregnancy care app guides you through important informations, foods, heath tips, baby appearance, different kind of pains during pregnancy and different stages and changes to the hormones during pregnancy and about food habits.\r\nPregnancy is defined as ‚Äòthe period from conception to birth when a woman carries a developing fetus in her uterus‚Äô. Let us see some of the common symptoms of pregnancies among women.\r\n\r\nMissing the period is the most common sign and indication of pregnancy. However a variety of other reasons such as stress, illness, and weight fluctuations etc also can cause the late or missed periods. Missing periods normally can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition in which periods can occur months apart.  Hence one has to observe rather examine the other symptoms to confirm the pregnancy. Another important symptom of pregnancy is the change in the size and feel of the breast immediately after the conception.  Breasts begin to enlarge to get ready for breast feeding and women claim that the breasts become sensitive and they experience a very sharp and twinkling sensation. \r\n                                       .   \r\nAnother most common symptom of pregnancy is nausea and vomiting normally seen among women. This is also known as morning sickness. A feeling of sickness is also being experienced by most women from the fifth and sixth week of the pregnancy. The morning sickness can start as early as 2 weeks of pregnancy.. The degree of nausea and vomiting differs from person to person. Mostly this symptom may disappear after period of 3 to 4 months. Most of the pregnant woman experience tiredness and fatigue. \r\n\r\nFrequent urination is also a common feature among pregnant women within 2-3 weeks after consumption due to the reduction in the size of the bladder . Drastic change in the taste and smell is also another factor resulting in craving for certain foods and start hating certain other types of food. All the above symptoms though normally confirm the pregnancy a clinical cal test is the ultimate proof. \r\n\r\nOne can confirm pregnancy by conducting the small home pregnancy test by detecting the level of HCG in the urine and if the result is positive one may need to make an appointment with family doctor to confirm the pregnancy and to start the follow up. Like the home pregnancy test the office urine test also confirms pregnancy by detecting the level of HCG in the urine. \r\n\r\nPregnancy week by week\r\nby day of pregnancy\r\npregnancy after cesarean\r\nMonthly pregnancy\r\npregnancy after birth\r\npregnancy by trimester\r\npregnancy after 40\r\nPregnancy with endometriosis\r\ncalculate pregnancy\r\npregnancy dream book\r\npregnancy after abortion\r\nFirst pregnancy\r\nFirst signs of pregnancy\r\nPregnancy test\r\nEarly pregnancy\r\nDefinition of term pregnancy\r\nStomach during pregnancy\r\nWhat is and what is not during pregnancy\r\nPregnancy and childbirth\r\nTrimesters of pregnancy\r\nteenage pregnancy counseling\r\nsigns of pregnancies\r\npregnancies test\r\nPain during pregnancy\r\nPregnancy calculator\r\nPregnancy symptoms\r\npregnancies symptoms\r\nPregnancy week by week\r\nDeciding to have a baby\r\nContraception information\r\nCalendar of pregnancy by weeks.\r\nPregnancy test checker free\r\nPregnant or trying to get pregnant\r\nPlanning pregnancy\r\nGetting pregnant\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThe info contained in the app is not a substitute for professional medical or health advice, examination, diagnosis, or treatment.

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",

Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",

But these hard-working little organs deserve better! The kidneys are responsible for so many important functions, including filtering toxins from your blood.\r\n\r\nA kidney infection, known as pyelonephritis, is normally affected by a bacterial infection. This type of bacterial infection originates from the urinary tract, and it spreads to the bladder through the urethra and kidneys. Therefore, it can cause negative consequences to one or both kidneys.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs a remarkable fact: Every 30 minutes, all the blood in your body travels through the kidneys. Every single day ‚Äì thanks to your kidneys ‚Äì more than two quarts of waste are cleared from your bloodstream and removed from the body as urine. Without this vital kidney function, waste would accumulate and serious damage to the organs throughout your body would occur.\r\n\r\nInfections and kidney stones are two of the most common kidney problems. Generally, infections are due to the bacteria E. coli gaining access to the urinary tract where they can connect with the kidneys. Technically, kidney infection is a form of urinary tract infection (UTI) and is treated with antibiotics.\r\n\r\nKidney stones, on the other hand, are solid, chemical deposits that form inside the kidney. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of kidney stones. A kidney stone can be nearly invisible to the naked eye, as large as a marble, or even bigger.\r\n\r\nOnly adopt these treatments when you are unable to see your doctor and need to reduce the pain and speed up the progress of recovering.

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

Reminds you when to do exercise, can adjust voice and vibration easily ( as i like to do them early in the morning in bed doesnt wake bubs). You can do kegels 3 times a day without going to settings to change. Its so easy and versatile. Wish the levels carried on but still a great app.",
            "I just started using this app, but so far, it's really convenient. For me, it helps remind me to do these, and it's helpful to have a voice counting and giving basic instructions. For whatever reason, I could never keep myself focused enough to do these with enough repitition to matter. This app helps keep me focused. This developer also has a really nice pedometer app that allows you to track your steps and maps your route, giving you updates along the way. I recommend both of these apps.",
            "I love the app in general, but have two little issues. First, the reminders rarely work (i have 3 per day). Second, I feel like the progression is slightly too fast, so I keep having to go back a level.",
            "First time using this and I have to say I'm impressed. Its really good. The voice assist and the exercises were really good. Looking forward to see whats next in store",
            "I really love this app. It is good for people who haven't done such exercises yet. Special respect for design and information about kegel)"

        "description": "Maintaining good hygiene and care of your genitals reduces the chances of developing problems like skin irritations and some common infections. Often it is assumed that men know the steps to good penis care, but it never hurts to remind yourself of the best practices.

Find out the most common penis problems and strategies to promote penis health.\r\n\r\nWhat is the penis?\r\n\r\nUsed for urination and sexual intercourse, the penis is made up  of two erectile cylinders (corpora cavernosa) that enlarge with blood during erection. A tough fibrous, partially elastic outer casing surrounds the cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra  (urinary tube), a tube that runs from the bladder to the end of the penis. The urethra carries urine and semen out of the body.\r\nThe head of the penis (glans penis) is covered by the foreskin in uncircumcised men.\r\n\r\nThe foreskin is the sheath of skin that covers the head (glans) of the penis. At birth, the foreskin is fully attached to the penis. In time, the foreskin separates and can be retracted (pulled back). This can usually be done by the age of about two. Sometimes, the foreskin separates later. Occasionally, the foreskin doesn‚Äôt separate evenly and areas remain stuck to the glans. These attachments almost always resolve by puberty. \r\n\r\nSome of The Topics on this app are:\r\n\r\nHow to look after your penis' health\r\nWhy is penis health so important?\r\nWhat can go wrong with my penis?\r\nHow do I know if there is something wrong with my penis?\r\nGeneral foreskin care ‚Äì babies and young boys\r\nGeneral foreskin care ‚Äì teenagers and men\r\n Common foreskin problems\r\nDIY penis maintenance\r\nMaintaining an erection\r\nProtect your penis from STIs\r\nUse your penis to keep it healthy\r\nHow to clean your penis\r\nDiagnosis of foreskin problems\r\nTreatment of foreskin problems\r\nCircumcision for older boys and men\r\nWhat care of the foreskin and penis is needed in infants, children and teenagers?\r\nHow do I teach my son to wash his penis?\r\nWhat happens if someone pulls back my son's foreskin too early?\r\nWhat is the white lump (smegma) under my son's foreskin?\r\nWhy does my son's foreskin 'balloon' when he wees?\r\nWhat if my son's foreskin can't be pulled back (phimosis)?\r\nWhat causes my son's foreskin to be red (balanitis)?\r\nWhat about circumcision?\r\nCare Advice for Foreskin Care\r\nalso a few other things that can hurt your penis\r\n8 warning signs from your penis\r\n8 Things You Didn't Know About Your Penis\r\n\r\nVisually inspecting your penis regularly to stay aware of any new symptoms or conditions that may occur is healthy and beneficial. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nThis information should not replace discussion with your doctor or a healthcare professional.
