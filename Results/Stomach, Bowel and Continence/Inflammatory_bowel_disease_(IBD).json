There's no way of editing my profile and it doesn't seem to flow as an app and finding and inputting data and information. I had to come out of the app and try it another day and it won't let me save my DOB and gender now so it's been uninstalled",
            "App resets every time you switch apps (including during registration) which means that if you need to check any information you lose any progress in the registration/survey/whatever process. A lot of the info this app collects (amount of excercise, amount of sleep, weight, etc) is already collected (often automatically) by other apps (google fit, Fitbit, etc) but there seems no way to link them, so you have to manually copy (with the annoyance that you can't switch apps as mentioned above!)",
            "I did download this app and tried using it. But my hospital isn't one of those linked to it. For me it was just a list of my pills and appointments, which I have in my diary and calendar anyway, and that was about it. It didn't even let me add symptoms apart from a questionnaire that was a one off rather than a daily tracker. Not for me I'm afraid.",
            "Poor - doesn't let you switch between apps as it loses your data. It doesn't include a food diary or detailed symptom log. Many hospitals aren't signed up. The symptoms that are listed are far too medical not everybody speaks the tongue of a doctor! It just seems like an NHS/ third party fishing trip for data, there are far better apps out there to use!"

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

            "This is a really great idea, it has loads of tracking options that I just love. But it has some bugs that mean I can't retrospectively add things, for example if I go to bed exhausted and haven't remembered to track my dinner that evening, I can't add it the next day. It also doesn't allow me to add ingredients that are not included on its surprisingly restricted list of ingredients. Overall, wonderful idea but the execution needs work.",
            "The app does a decent job of tracking bowel movements, diet, and medicine. I have noted several issues and sent reports to the app developers. I have received no response. The preset medicine doses will sometimes double or quadruple in your queue and past medical history. I have on prescription that shows up eight times a day when I only take it once a day. Also if you add a duplicate food item you cannot delete it. And the ingredient options and search feature is extremely limited.",
            "Although this is a good app and it is headed in the right direction I find it not as easy or simple to use as other meal or health logging apps. I have my medications listed in the app but I'd like to be able to log if I have had them or not, it's handy to look back and see when I forgot my medication and how it affected me. I find the coloured backgrounds also make it harder to read. And I'd like to see more auto immune flammatory symptoms listed that are connected. E.g., sore back, dermatitis.",
            "Absolutely amazing, thank you so incredibly much for developing (& continuing to improve) this app...it has been a real game changer for me. I've tried many versions of food logs and wellness apps over the years but nothing compares to the insight I have gained through the easy and intuitive design of this application. Tracking my health doesn't feel like a chore anymore!!",
            "I use it to track my bowel movements everyday. It's very helpful for when I have doctors appointments or test/procedures done because when they ask how many times a day I go or about my bleeding and what not all the information is there on my phone and completely accurate because it's recorded. It's also nice because I can remember when I've had scopes or blood tests too because it also tracks that."

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. üòä",

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",
            "I use it for my IBS and how bloated I am etc good reminder."

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

            "So at first I really liked the app. The tracking was easy, the graphs were helpful, and I liked that I could add my own symptoms to focus on what my specific issues were. But I ran into two deal killers for me.  1) you can't retroactively add bowel movements. Which is annoying because sometimes it's inconvenient to track it in the moment. Which leads to issue #2 2) I had a hard time accessing the tracking portion if I didn't have good cell reception. Bathrooms don't always have the best cell service so why I couldn't just track offline is beyond me. This wouldn't be a big problem if I could just log it later, but you can't.  It's a good app just didnt fit my desired style of use."

I'll keep using it for now since it's the closest thing to what I was looking for.",

For example, it seems like it's not possible to change days on the calendar to add food on a different day (I forgot to log my dinner yesterday and it just goes under today). If the function is there please let me know where xD I would also like to see a time for logging food. The mood logging is also not super clear. App with a potential but need some work, I will gladly change my feedback if it improves :)",

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause.",

            "In response to PlopüòÄ Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

            "In response to PlopüòÄ Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

It can also be used to determine your personal threshold (tolerance level) for different foods once a diagnosis has been made. \r\nThe app contains neither advertisements nor any hidden costs such as in-app purchases.\r\n-----\r\nWhy use this app?\r\n-----\r\nIf you believe that you may be suffering from some form of food intolerance or food allergy it is essential to keep a food and symptoms diary for about 2 weeks. With the help of such a food and journal, the medical professional you are consulting can narrow down the reasons for your symptoms. This means they can focus on the right follow-up (eg. H2 breath test) and thus reach an accurate diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe app can also be used after diagnosis. Different foods need to be tested to establish a person‚Äôs individual tolerance level, e.g. fructose or FODMAP levels. Therefore, keeping a food and symptoms diary makes sense. \r\n\r\nThe app is simple and intuitive. You can record your daily meals by entering them into the journal or simply taking a photo. You can also track your bowel movement or note your symptoms as well as the degree of severity and produce a clearly readable PDF which you can take to your doctor‚Äôs appointment. Symptoms can also be recorded by taking a photo, which is especially useful when you have symptoms such as rashes or other skin changes.\r\n\r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\r\nThe app can also be used for recording the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn‚Äôs disease. \r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\r\nAlso patients who follow a FODMAP diet due to IBS may use this app to track their nutrition and symptoms.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nQuestions or comments?\r\n-----\r\nThis app has its own support forum at www.food-intolerance-network.com.

These settings can be changed at any time. The app will NOT read or access any other details in your contacts and will not send any such data back to us.\r\n+ Other: With this app you can create and send a PDF file using the network connection of your phone.

A Cobb Salad (and what's on it) is very different than a House Salad. Also needs to allow you to add notes more than just the basic IBS flare up symptoms. Not everyone experiences IBS in those ways. Would also be nice to have a calendar feature for planning meals if you're into that. Back to paper for now I guess...",

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

Complications may include bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors.

Common causes include infection with Helicobacter pylori and use of NSAIDs.

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book üò≠ I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

I know it might sound like technical jargon but these mucous membranes are made up of the membrane wall and the mucosal lining. Using naturally occurring herbs, amino acids and fatty acids the right way, one can successfully rebuild the mucous membranes.

Some of the habits which you ought to drop or at least restrain yourself from are: - large meals which will fill you up to the brim, strong medications (specifically if you are trying out Herbal Remedies for IBS or IBS treatment), Bloating from gas in the colon, caffeine induced drinks such as tea, coffee and soft drinks, over dosage of alcohol, chocolate, wheat, barley, rye or even milk products, constant worry, inconsistency, or emotional upsets.

            "I tried putting in my weight, and while it shows \"kg\" as the measurement, when you look at the log, it shows \"lb\". Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",
            "This app is great. Tracks a ton of information I can share with my doctor. Quick.  Easy. Love the reports and notes features."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "description": "Kidneys\r\n\r\nConcomitant to their name, kidneys are positioned at the back of the abdominal cavity. Kidneys execute some very vital functions in the human body. These entail formation of urine, balancing chemicals and fluids in the body and extracting waste from the bloodstream. Moreover, they assist various other organs in carrying out routine functions in the body.\r\n\r\nThe pre-eminent functions of the kidneys are as follows\r\n\r\n1. Blood Pressure Regulation\r\nKidneys require a consistent flow of blood to filter it. In case the blood pressure drops, kidneys immediately begin increasing it. This is attained by the production of a vessel-constricting protein known as angiotensin. The kidneys produce this protein to regulate blood pressure and signal the body to retain water and sodium.\r\n\r\n2. Waste Excretion\r\nThe human body accumulates harmful elements such as toxins, urea and excess salts over time. Kidneys facilitate the excretion of these harmful elements by filtering the bloodstream.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain Water Levels\r\nKidneys adjust their function to the level of water intake. If in case the water intake drops, kidneys help retain water in the body instead of flushing it through urine.\r\n\r\n4. Acid Regulation\r\nThe body‚Äôs environment can get acidic if the kidneys do not perform their balancing function. Kidneys filter out toxins and metals that can lead to increased acidity.\r\n\r\n5. Red Blood Cell Stimulation\r\nLike every organ kidneys require proper oxygenation to keep up their activity. In case of oxygen, deficiency kidneys release erythropoietin which stimulates the bone marrow and increases the production of red blood cells.\r\n\r\nKidney health is extremely crucial for the human body. Healthy nutrient-dense foods are necessary to maintain proper kidney function.\r\n\r\nDiet has a close relation to kidney health. Deficiency of vital nutrients can be the cause of kidney diseases and kidney failure. People in the advanced stages of kidney disease need to adopt a kidney-friendly diet to prevent kidney failure. Diet requirements vary depending on the stage of kidney disease, however, eating foods low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus can altogether prevent any abnormality in the kidney function.\r\n \r\nIf You like The App Pls Rate it 5 stars!!!",

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",

Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

        "descriptionHTML": "Wana is a community platform that fosters hope, direction, and healing for people with chronic and invisible illnesses. Think of us like the social network for health, specifically designed to help the millions of people who live with conditions like Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, Crohn‚Äôs disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, endometriosis, and POTS, among many others. No matter what chronic or invisible illness you face, Wana will remind you--every time you log on--that you are not alone. <br><br>Wana was built by a team of people who live with chronic and invisible conditions and understand what our community members are going through. Our founders met by chance and connected over their shared health stories: mysterious symptoms, frustrating misdiagnoses, and a sense of isolation. As they bonded over their symptoms, shared advice about treatments, and supported each other in finding answers, their health challenges became a lot less overwhelming. They got better, together. <br><br>Wana was created for people like you and people like us. It‚Äôs the answer to the confusion, overwhelm, and loneliness that often comes with living with an invisible or chronic condition. At Wana, illness doesn&#39;t isolate us--it connects us.

I still have depression, so I don't necessarily want to remove it from diagnoses, but I think I'll have to just so I can get the information I actually need.",
            "This app is overrun with spam, fake accounts, and people trying to scam others. There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. üòÇ The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. üòÇ",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

        "description": "This APP provides you with all the food you need to take to take care of your heart and to prevent heart diseases.\r\n\r\nt's the perfect opportunity to be more proactive about taking care of your heart. After all, it works hard - without breaks - to keep you alive, so you should do your part and return the favor.\r\n\r\nWhy else is it important to maintain a healthy heart as you age?\r\n\r\nTaking great care of your heart to avoid cardiovascular disease is critical, but that shouldn't be your only motivator. There are many other reasons to proactively maintain a healthy heart:\r\n\r\n1. To maintain cholesterol and blood pressure\r\nHigh cholesterol levels increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but that's not all. Unhealthy cholesterol in the blood can also lead to heart attack and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure levels are even more threatening to your overall health. Besides a heightened risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure, you're also more likely to develop peripheral artery disease, angina, vision loss and kidney disease or failure.\r\n\r\n2. To reduce feelings of depression\r\nDid you know that cardiovascular disease can increase your chance of feeling depressed? Research shows that 33 percent of heart attack victims end up showing depressive symptoms, according to Barry Jacobs, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and director of Behavioral Sciences at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program.\r\n\r\n\"The big message is that people need to be aware of this connection,\" he told the American Heart Association, where he volunteers. \"The second message is that many treatments are available. No one needs to suffer.\"\r\nResearch shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.Research shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.\r\n\r\n3. To lower your risk of developing dementia\r\nThere's a connection between heart health and mental well-being, but it goes beyond feelings of depression. Research shows that poor heart health is also associated with dementia. When you don't properly take care of your heart - with smart lifestyle decisions - you're narrowing your blood vessels, which then limits the amount of blood that can get to the brain. Without proper blood flow, your brain can't work the way it's supposed to and you may have trouble making decisions, reasoning with others and remembering familiar faces and places.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate memory loss with Alzheimer's disease, and they think it can't be prevented or treated,\" said Ralph Sacco, M.D., chief of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and former president of the American Heart Association. \"But controlling your risk factors for heart disease can make a difference in slowing its progression.\"\r\n\r\nHow can I take better care of my heart?\r\nBy making smarter lifestyle choices, you can protect your heart and reduce your risk for developing life-threatening conditions. Making these small decisions can have a large impact on the health of your heart and your overall well-being:\r\n\r\n    Follow a heart-healthy diet\r\n    By eating more nutritious foods and removing unhealthy fats from your diet, you can fuel a thriving heart, reduce your blood and cholesterol levels and maintain your weight, according to the Heart Foundation. Eat more fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, and limit your salt and alcohol intake.\r\n   \r\nDownload the application and learn about foods that prevent heart diseases and maintain a healthy heart.\r\n\r\nGood luck to all and hope the remedies in this application will help you keep a healthy heart \r\n\r\nConsider sharing  this application to family and friends, it would be a huge support to rate this App five star so that people can easily find it in the store.\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out this App!!",

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Just in the last 4 or 5 days it was great. But, suddenly it stopped working. I keep getting \"unknown error try again.\" So, I tried un-installing only to see an update pending. Even after updating I am still getting the same errors. In addition, its not opening any links left in screen that i get news notifications...sorry I don't know the name of that particular screen. However, I would have given 5 stars! Fix the problem and I'll upgrade my 1-star rating.",
            "Riddled with annoying ads especially the annoying Korean ad dubbed in English of the firefighter using an infrared camera. Very repetitive stories; news content very selective in coverage and is not changed rapidly enough. App indicates on its icon new news stories but when opened the user is not expedited to the new news stories; there is no personalization to filter out content that is less or not interesting to the user with focus on content of interest, not b.s.. CNN the channel is better.",
            "The \"cast\" button keeps disappearing from my Android phone display. I can watch CNN or HLN on the phone but not cast to the TV. The button appeared once, I clicked it, but now all I see on my TV is the red CNN logo. Plus, what's up with the \"two screens\" display on the phone at the top? What is that for? So confusing.",
            "I have this app for breaking news alerts, but in the past couple of days I've been getting \"alerts\" about interviews and other CNN content. In my settings, I ONLY have breaking news selected. If this keeps happening I'll have to find a new breaking news app",
            "Not sure what's going on with the Android version of CNN. Videos don't work at times, links don't go to matching video from Home page on app. And when I open the app, it takes me back to the same article from weeks ago (even when I close the app, or all my app). I'm on a Note 10+ so not on an Android device. It worked bigger on my iPhone 7. Deleting and reading from there or on a browser. Bummer."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "FINALLY, thank you for no longer changing the modification date when moving a file (across storage type)!! However, the modification date changes when renaming the file, which shouldn't happen. UPDATE X¬∑2020: Please do not sort folders by date with files; folders used to always be above files and that should remain.",
            "Been used across various mobile phones over the years as a means of accessing the root of the phone and micro sd available on the device, easily cut, copy and paste files etc and create folders as well",
            "There are so many add. in this app which can irritate anyone. Also you can not see your hidden files in free version which most of the file manager apps provide.",
            "I've been using this app for years now, it's absolutely brilliant I love it and I would recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a better system for their files than the one pre installed on their phone. All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

But you don't pay for any piece of additional info that is not  being seen free on you device.",

        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "I love the way Baby Bus apps have back to back 30 second forced adverts that my 2 year old gets to watch. No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 √©nergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! üòâ",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

As soon as they begin to disappear until others appear, they are waiting.\r\n\r\nThis endless and endless battle is often repeated in a tired and despairing way.\r\n\r\nHormones are likely to play a major role in the appearance of acne and make it an irritant for young people in particular. However, people of all age groups may suffer from acne.\r\n\r\nSome women may also experience mild acne at different stages of hormonal changes, such as pregnancy, menstrual cycle, when using anti-pregnancy pills or when they stop taking them.\r\nSymptoms of acne\r\n\r\nAcne (acne) appears on the skin surface of the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders. These are the areas of the skin that contain the largest number of active sebaceous glands.\r\n\r\nAcne appears in various forms, such as:\r\nWhite or blackheads (comedon): These headers appear when the follicles contain follicles (follicles) follicle, resulting from milky secretions, dead skin cells or bacteria. When the heads are open to the surface of the skin called black heads, the black color of the material collected in the hair follicle. When these heads are closed, they are called white heads, which originate from the surface of the skin and appear as bumps in the color of the skin.\r\n    Blackheads on the surface of the skin are an indication of inflammation or contamination of hair follicles.

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen üëëeven when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

I'm not saying that this problem is on you guys end but, when it logs me out of an online match I lose money each time and can't get it back. I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

            "I gave you only one star because I liked it very little. The problem is that I am a kid and and I can't buy stuff. Your other games are like that too. It is showing that I need to make a blue Very Berry Shortcake but blue is locked. Fix it üò°üò°üò°üò°",
            "Honestly i realy like this game , but i have to buy so PLEASE MAKE IT FAIR . I just dont want to wast my money ok..",
            "Honestly, its pretty fun. But, we barley get options for anything. I really do think that maybe 1 or 2 more cake options should be free, along with more decorations, food dye, and utensils.",
            "Only one cake is unlocked. All the others are locked and you have to pay for each one. One is currently ¬£2.99 and another one is ¬£9.99. Seems like a really lovely app and i wouldn't mind paying if it was for all for ¬£9.99."

        "description": "Stomach ache and abdominal pain\r\nA stomach ache is a term often used to refer to cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It's usually short-lived and is often not serious.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis ‚Äì the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer ‚Äì a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones ‚Äì small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis ‚Äì inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS ‚Äì a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ‚Äì long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning ‚Äì in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain ‚Äì painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems ‚Äì such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. \r\n2. Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

They we're just letting me know about Tom's Place. It's really good too. Kinda slow at times but it's not bad. I would definitely recommend üòä this app.",
            "I am tired of this app crashing, repeatedly. I will be in the middle of an interesting article and the app closes and restarts. I even deleted it and reloaded it and it still happens. To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

The release notes don't reveal this cut (nor the removal of the offline dictionary as a free feature), so the bait and switch just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",
            "Endless problems with this app, after the recent update app crashes the moment I opened it. PLUS. Offline dictionary is utter useless. I cant search for anything when I'm offline. I don't even know the download progress of my offline dictionary. I regret paying for this app. I've been forcing myself to use this cause I paid for it but now this is way too much.",
            "EDIT I absolutely love the new layout, it's so well designed that I'm fine with this app not having a dark mode. It's a overall a great app otherwise I wouldn't pay for all the bells and whistles, however its missing a dark/black theme, if it had that it would be the perfect dictionary app üëåüòé. (Thanks for taking your time to read this)",
            "Just updated, now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't respond to any touch. Now crashing. Now it works a little bit before crashing. All my recents and searches are gone. This is frustrating, don't mess with my recents list.",
            "Best dictionary and dictionary app ever. The latest redesign is beautiful, the offline dictionary download has been fixed, but it seems the speed of the app when showing the definition, even after the offline dictionary is downloaded, is considerably slower than the previous version."

Minus x 2: very often when I tap to open an article, it goes to a completely different article. This happens probably 20% of the time I'm on the app.",
            "If you want to read an article it will work...sometimes, or it will just give you an article that it decides you want instead. Want to stream something, sure, just get comfy as it buffers every 20 seconds or so whether it's your mobile device or you PC so a college game takes 5 hours, not that you can seen it properly because of pixelated buffering. This doesn't happen in any of my other streaming services, just this. Worldwide leader in sports, dumpster fire of digital media.",
            "Too many bugs. Many articles do not load completely and some just load the first few lines and then nothing but vertical lines. It's a mess! The loading issue was fixed, but now the article links take you to the wrong story. Streaming is ok, but it does drop out too much. Update: loading issues fixed but the links are always messed up. Clicking on a story takes you to a completely different story.",
            "I have the espn, disney, hulu bundle. Espn app works 10% of the time. I'm constantly trying to log into my provider to watch live TV. Tonight I tried to watch a college football game on espn3. It keeps telling me that Im not authorized to watch the stream, which is false, or it can't authentic my provider. This is more than annoying. I pay a subscription for your app and it doesn't even work right have of the time.",
            "Update: October 9. Still buffering for pretty much everything. I just download stuff over night and watch offline. Recently, sound is not synchronized with video. Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

            "Two is what you get!! I'm pissed right now with the bugs on the dunk game. It's been several times when Im in the middle of a dunk and matter fact, nah I'm giving yall one star. Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed üòû",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# üò± Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! üòÄ By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review‚àö",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to shortüòÄ but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

            "This game is awesome in my opinion you can care for it and play games most of them take finger and hand eye coordination so if you need to practice some of the games will help you can go outside and collect food from the trees just like animal crossing",

From last 1 week after new update it was not working. When i was forwarding or searching its not working. Asking for close or wait. Earlier update is good. Now is very worst. Pls update soon.

Please do something about this.",

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I think this game is amazing! Definitely recommend! üëçThe graphics and flow of the movement is very good! And yes there's ads. (Obviously) But unlike most other games like these, the ads barely even bother you! The only trouble I'm having is sometimes when I collect keys or coins it lags just a bit, not enough to mess up the entire \"round\" though. Also anytime I'm trying to buy something (With in-game coins) It will switch to another thing like toppings or food items and buy those instead.PlzFix",
            "Game is fun but the levels actually only repeat it's self, i got all the foods with in 2 days, i got the unicorn in 1 day and the space cat in the 2nd day, i reccomend this game if u like saticefying games, add a longer and better level every now and then it would be great,i gave 3 stars because of the repeating levels and the quick ones to and because it is not very creative üëçüèªüôÉ",
            "I just downloaded this game and I already like it!Its very fun and reminds me of when me and my mum were baking together!It is hard to keep the cream on the foods,yes but besides from that I recommend downloading it! Also something pretty Annoying can happen where there is too many adds but the game 'yes that dress'(wich I'll recommend downloading to)has adds every next button so the game 'yes that dress'has more adds",
            "To say it's kinda boring but normally it's a very good game it's so much fun and it has a bit of slow motion when I ice the cream on top of the strawberries and waffles and just installed this game today!I'm 8 years old but this is 3 stars it's kinda boring",
            "I saw this in an ad ao i decided to try it. The idea itself sounlds not to bad, but it turned out to be a bit laggy and had this vibration everytime i squeezed the cream? I think the vibration is the point but i think the vibration feeling is annoying and bothering"

THANK YOU!!! üòä",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "I bought the BTS membership February 1, 2020 and still haven't gotten my membership box to this day. I understand with covid there is a delay but I work for the postal service and its not that big of a delay anymore from overseas. No updated emails about delays, no communication. Hard to purchase certain shows too. Another 2 1/2 months later still nothing.",
            "i purchased army membership in april 2020 but still not get my army membership kit..also everything i try to purchase (includes merch),there is a message showing\"cannot be shipped ro India\"..i mean its so frustrating as now international flights also started but they are always showing this that they can't ship in india anything",
            "Overall a good app. It would be nice if completed orders listed an estimated shipping date!! Most items are presale with shipping dates months away & it's hard to keep track when you have multiple orders! I completely understand that shipment dates are subject to change but when there are multiple rounds of presales you can't even check the product listing for the right shipping information."

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications üò∂I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand üòê cause of the translator. Please fix these issues üôÇ",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant üòÅüòâ",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. üòä",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

            "Nice interface. Though each type of device has a different user experience, (iOS, Android, MacOS), a little weird but each is still very good. I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping ü§£ its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day üòÇ The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more üëå",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off ü§£. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "This app was my favorite one at a time it was relaxing and makes me happy but now it is a very bad app . Coz till fifth level we sell ice creams in a motorcycle like thing but when we finish the fifth level it says that the road is rocky so we should pay an amount and get a big van to sell the ice cream. And if we look other characters shop and sell ice creams like blueberry muffins shop . They are closed we should complete all levels of the strawberry shortcake's shop and then get them .",
            "My kids like the strawberry shortcake games and I am even happy to pay for the DLC which I did for this. Unfortunately its locked to my account so even though the kids share a tablet as they have their own accounts. I dont want to pay for everything twice so I'm not buying any more DLC.",
            "It is fun...but you only get 4 levels for free which is pretty dissapointing. There are not many things for free.",
            "The game is a 5 star but I gave it 3 Stars because you have to pay for the game and I cant complete it now sorry if you fix the game then I will give it 5 stars but until then it stays as a 3 star game sorry (just my opinion by the way)",
            "It was a complete 5 star experience, simple and easy to learn building up sequences to fulfill the orders. The issue is without paying the game can not be completed, which is still ok as the effort of development deserves the money, but today we realized the already completed demo regions can not be played for free anymore... This was an awful experience, the price is fair but this action made it considerable to pay.."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! üç∞üç©üçÆ",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more üí∞. Please fix those things üôèüôè. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!‚õëÔ∏è",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ‚ú≥Ô∏è üí´!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ‚ùå Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT üëçüëçüëçüëç",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 üíé and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ‚ô°"

The subscription renewed last May for the year, but constantly tries to get me to upgrade and pay again from with the app. It's stupid that I can't download a \"pro\" version from the app store, and forced to pay again from within the app. Very deceptive.",
            "Cant get the app to work Edit: Cant get the app to work. When I click \"Analyze\" it takes me back to \"Home Screen\". I click de app again, I get a message that says \"App keeps closing\". Below that there are two options. 1. App info. 2. Close app. And that`s it. I have this app in another Android tablet and works fine. But it won't work on this new Galaxy tab S5e Android tablet.",

No link, no instructions and after trying to activate every potential icon I still don't get any further forward. Another example of a program relying on people already knowing how to work it. But for me, just a waste of memory space. I get faster and better results from just rebooting.",
            "I use to use CCleaner years ago when I was in the computer repair field. When I found out CCleaner was available on Android naturally I was intrigued. After using it for well over a month I found CCleaner to be utterly useless. #1. It doesn't do anything my phone doesn't already do. #2. The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps. Low and behold it was drastically off."

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It's a fun, clicker game also great to pass the time. It's not a complex super story based action rpg game. However its simple and rather fun. If you need to pass a large amount of time. I would suggest this game definitely to a friend. Who not looking for anything fo complex story or super high open world multiplayer type game.",
            "Very nice game 5 stars. Still a decent amount of people who play boss hunt. Easy to pass time and play offline if you wish. Developers listen to help make the game better for player experience. Plays smoothly. The ads to get extra items such as cash or tokens or even gems helps you progress through the game a lot faster. Well done with that keep it up",
            "It's a shame really. I love this game, but you spend more time watching adds than playing. I've left the game a few times and come back hopeful it had gotten better. Nope, worse if anything. Not sure it's even really been updated in a long time either. Plus the timing on your taps are strange at times.",
            "My Knight hasn't stopped for 4-5 Years. Bought a new phone. Just reloaded the game. Trillions in bonuses to unlock. Nice. Nice to watch. You equip him with Swords n fancy weapons. You control the buffs in the fight. Lazy way to play, but still good entertainment.",
            "Guess you could say the gameplay is so fun (& offline) it gets addicting... least it does for me.. Not a lot of hype to buy stuff either, so naturally = 5 stars!!!"

            "I like this game alot! Its very fun to make vlogs and other stuff. I got this app a couple days ago and I already am starting to love it! There is an issue with the ads but that doesn't really bother me alot I don't find it a problem.. you can create vlogs, dress your avatar up, make vlogs, and more! Other than the ads this game is amazing. The way that you can comment on peoples vlogs/videos is AMAZING! Its really fun how you get 10,000 subs in one day. I hope the future updates are good too!",
            "I love this game! Its amazing and has so many things that are cool! One thing that would be better is maybe if u could comment on other peoples videos just like in real life!! Other thann that there is a really good game that every one should install as soon as possible! Make sure that u dont have ads though because there are a lot of them! Makers if your reading this please cut back on all the ads they are kinda annoying and ridiculous how many there are! But overall its a really AMAZING game!!",
            "I love this game! I would give it 5 stars but there is a lot of tapping and the more videos you make the longer it lakes to make them. I wish you could comment on other people's videos and comments. You should make it so you can interact with different objects like the swimming pool and basketball hoop and maybe even control what you are doing in the videos. Like you say your going to do sports as the topic and then you try and shoot hoops for the video. I do recommend this game, it's fun!",
            "Amazing game! I love playing it. I would recommend it, has fun rewards, you can watch a stream, etc. But one thing that bugs me is when I got more then 5,000 subscribers, the box thing didn't unlock. Please fix it and I will get a 5 star rating for you.",
            "It's a pretty fun game I've been looking for something like this for a while. The reason for three stars is bc to post a video all you do is just pick a topic and done. Like you can only TALK about something not like do a challenge. I wanted to do a WoF video but you can't do that."

            "Absolutely amazing! I've been looking for an app like this for years. Did some research: the company is solid and secure. They actually charge no fees on the \"Invest\" account. Beware of \"CFD\" account, if you don't know how it works it's easy to lose money. Depositing was instant and withdraw took about 3 hours. The app is simple and complete. Use this promo code before your first deposit (in the app settings, Invest account) and you'll get a real free stock share in 3 working days: GvFjLLHy",
            "One of the best apps for trading but I find Stocks & etfs to be limited, its quite annoying as I love the app, easy to use & reliable but when doing a search & not being able to find some well known & opular stocks/etfs that can be easily found in other apps makes the experience frustrating as I can't keep growing my portfolio & also more historical data for the stocks is needed as it seems to only show you until it was added to T212 for the first time? Will change to 5‚òÜ when this improves.üëç",
            "After a bit of practice this app is very intuitive and easy to use. Quite addictive but some care is needed esp when doing CFD's. Care also to avoid getting carried away buying and trading. Lots of options available and moving/withdrawing funds is very easy. All in all a great app. and to be recommended if you have an interest in stocks, shares etc.",
            "Generally, excellent. It's currently the only decent app I've used for trading within an ISA. It's very easy to use, you can get money in and out pretty quickly, the technical indicators are good and their support is very responsive. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the automatic trading triggers are a little dumb and there's no pre or after market trading but these are only an issue for more advanced users.",
            "This app is a perfect start for people new to investing. It has a nice ui combined with a practise mode for those uneasy about investing during the current economic crisis. Ive used it ever since i realised turning a profit on fake money in video games was enjoyable and applying it to real life its a thrilling gamble (investment) ease of access, guides, and multiple optuons for methods of investing."
