            "Not sure what the people leaving 1-stars are talking about, this app works quite well. I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease (can't have gluten), so I'm glad this app exists. I tested it out on some products in my house, and what really impressed me is how lightning FAST it is when scanning and looking up products. Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",

            "I'm glad I only installed the free version. I'm new to avoiding gluten and very few of my foods I have in my house even show up. The suggested or related foods are always some expensive wholefoods brands. I just want an app that can tell me what foods I normally eat are safe and what I need to find alternative gluten free products for. Not very helpful.",

            "Seems to catch only sections of barcode and not the whole thing. It will scan, but miss the last part of the barcode and say that item is not in the database. Edit: thanks to the developer for a quick response! I will try more products"

I understand the need for the income, but see no compensation for the contributers. I would like to see something like 'free short-term premium for X reviews/additions'.",

Have used in other countries and was really helpful in our first trip to Barcelona. Travel in states we have used for first time trips - Chicago, Nashville, Kingsport, road trips between cities, Portland, Oregon Coast, Oahu just as examples.",

I'm not thrilled with the new \"premium\" features, but I spoke to the developer and understand why he implemented them. and there are a couple ways around using them, if you're cash-strapped like me and don't eat out enough to need them.",

Frequently I have to add new places as there are no reviews - and the app fights you tooth and nail when you try to add places. But we will get there! And I would still say it is a \"must have\" for a traveling celiac.",

Used to have several features I've paid for off and on over the years, now there is absolutely no point to the free version of the app. And the price isn't worth it for questionable crowd sourced information that might be detrimental to your health."

            "I was so excited when I found this app. Then was super disappointed once I started/ tried to use it. I just had a blood test recently that listed 17 foods that I am sensitive to, eggs, cheese, pineapple, rice as well as gluten just to name a few. I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",
            "Limited food selection. For example, acorn squash not listed. Grey color coding not explained. Would not use as definitive guide. Last updated over 2 years ago.",

But it has still a long way to go, many additives are missing, but keep up the good work {edit: OK, I will try to collect the missing additives} Also – for the information to be correct I strongly suggest that you include if the additive MAY BE WHEAT DERIVED. That way a user can make an informed decision. Many Celiac people are still too sensitive to have any additive that was wheat based – like mannitol, MSG, etc.",

I still confirm with the that they are a dedicated kitchen before going, so far no issues. The map is a great feature.",
            "App has potential. At the present moment it does not locate anything at all, not even big cities like Philadelphia which have a ton of GF establishments and/or offerings. The first day I used it a few months back it introduced me to a bakery that was new too me. Aside from that, nothing! Hope you figure out how to remedy the glitches, best of luck!",
            "Location Services REQUIRED. Why can't I bypass that and input in a zip code or town and state? It's foolish to assume I want to find places where I currently am every time I open the app. You wait for the app to load and can't change the search location. So much for planning out restaurants before traveling.",
            "It is so wonderful to be able to find safe places to eat with this app! Richmond, VA doesn't have many options, but I now know of 3 new places that I had no clue about. This will definitely make my next traveling experience much much safer and less anxiety-ridden.",
            "I love this app! I found some great new places to eat close to home. I also travel a lot and this has been very helpful. It's so nice to get to try new places and not have to go to the old standbys when I'm on the road."

        "title": "Gluten Dude: Got Celiac? Live a Better Life.",
        "description": "The purpose of my app is simple: to better the lives of those living with celiac disease and anyone else who must eat gluten-free; to create a close-knit community where people in the gluten-free community come to discover, to learn, to share, and to connect, all to make their lives easier and healthier.\r\n\r\nLiving a 100% gluten-free life certainly has it challenges: physically, mentally and socially. Using the Gluten Dude app will help alleviate those challenges.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: EATING OUT SAFELY\r\nEating out is one of the more stressful parts of having celiac disease. One crumb is all it takes to set off the autoimmune response. Everything that is fun and spontaneous about eating out can be overshadowed by the anxiety of whether you can get through your meal unscathed.\r\n\r\nSolution: A directory of only 100% gluten-free restaurants, guaranteeing you a safe meal. Each restaurant includes images, a description, reviews, ratings, directions, etc. The app currently covers the US, Canada, Paris, Italy, London, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia, with more locations coming. \r\n\r\nNote: Recommended but Non-100% GF restaurants are now included on the app as well but are clearly delineated. These restaurants are personally vetted before being added to the app. NEW RESTAURANTS ADDED EVERY DAY!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: GETTING BAD/WRONG ADVICE\r\nThe internet is littered with falsehoods and dangerous information regarding celiac disease. People are looking for answers to their problems, quickly and accurately, and they are not sure where to turn or who to trust, putting their health in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nSolution: A forum where fear mongering and misinformation will be strongly discouraged. Varying opinions? Absolutely. But no \"McDonalds French Fries are gluten free\" kind of stuff. There are a number of topics where you’ll be able to chime in with questions, answers and advice. The forum includes Ask the Community, Ask Gluten Dude, Share Your Celiac Story, and more.\r\n\r\nYou also have access to videos from yours truly (Gluten Dude), where I answer reader emails, throw out some celiac rants and talk about the world of celiac disease.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: ISOLATION\r\nCeliac disease is a very misunderstood disease and can be quite isolating. I've received so many emails over the years from people whose own friends and family don't take their disease seriously; who don't get invited out to eat because they're \"too difficult\"; who are bullied at school simply because they can't eat gluten. And most of the time, there is no one there to turn to, to listen to you, to understand you.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION: Live chat. This app will connect you with others in the celiac/GF community, allowing one on one private chats.

        "descriptionHTML": "The purpose of my app is simple: to better the lives of those living with celiac disease and anyone else who must eat gluten-free; to create a close-knit community where people in the gluten-free community come to discover, to learn, to share, and to connect, all to make their lives easier and healthier.<br><br>Living a 100% gluten-free life certainly has it challenges: physically, mentally and socially. Using the Gluten Dude app will help alleviate those challenges.<br><br>CHALLENGE: EATING OUT SAFELY<br>Eating out is one of the more stressful parts of having celiac disease. One crumb is all it takes to set off the autoimmune response. Everything that is fun and spontaneous about eating out can be overshadowed by the anxiety of whether you can get through your meal unscathed.<br><br>Solution: A directory of only 100% gluten-free restaurants, guaranteeing you a safe meal. Each restaurant includes images, a description, reviews, ratings, directions, etc. The app currently covers the US, Canada, Paris, Italy, London, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia, with more locations coming. <br><br>Note: Recommended but Non-100% GF restaurants are now included on the app as well but are clearly delineated. These restaurants are personally vetted before being added to the app. NEW RESTAURANTS ADDED EVERY DAY!<br><br>CHALLENGE: GETTING BAD/WRONG ADVICE<br>The internet is littered with falsehoods and dangerous information regarding celiac disease. People are looking for answers to their problems, quickly and accurately, and they are not sure where to turn or who to trust, putting their health in jeopardy.<br><br>Solution: A forum where fear mongering and misinformation will be strongly discouraged. Varying opinions? Absolutely. But no &quot;McDonalds French Fries are gluten free&quot; kind of stuff. There are a number of topics where you’ll be able to chime in with questions, answers and advice. The forum includes Ask the Community, Ask Gluten Dude, Share Your Celiac Story, and more.<br><br>You also have access to videos from yours truly (Gluten Dude), where I answer reader emails, throw out some celiac rants and talk about the world of celiac disease.<br><br>CHALLENGE: ISOLATION<br>Celiac disease is a very misunderstood disease and can be quite isolating. I&#39;ve received so many emails over the years from people whose own friends and family don&#39;t take their disease seriously; who don&#39;t get invited out to eat because they&#39;re &quot;too difficult&quot;; who are bullied at school simply because they can&#39;t eat gluten. And most of the time, there is no one there to turn to, to listen to you, to understand you.<br><br>SOLUTION: Live chat. This app will connect you with others in the celiac/GF community, allowing one on one private chats. You’ll even have the option of providing your zip code, allowing people to search for others by location.<br><br>CHALLENGE: FINDING GLUTEN-FREE BEER<br>Beer, sadly, is not gluten-free. The most popular &quot;gluten-free&quot; beers on the market today are actually &quot;gluten-removed&quot; and are not safe to drink.

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

Además de cocinar sin gluten y cocinar la celiaquía, los restauradores deben ser capaces de garantizar la ausencia total de contaminación cruzada a la hora de preparar los platos sin gluten.",

This can be helpful in reducing symptoms for people with IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance and various other food intolerances, food sensitivities, and stomach problems.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Comprehensive list of foods and whether or not they are low FODMAP foods, to make finding foods that won't exacerbate your IBS easier.\r\n- Search by food name and category.\r\n- General FODMAP Diet and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and - \r\n- Lactose Intolerence and other food sensitivities info.\r\n- Additional details on the specific breakdowns of each food and whether it is high, medium, or low in the main categories of Polyols, Oligos, Fructose, and Lactose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Features Include:\r\nMy Experience - Log your personal experience with foods to determine if a food works for you regardless of its FODMAP content. Rate whether you had a good or bad reaction to a food after eating it, then leave detailed notes so that you know for next time how said food will affect you.\r\n\r\nCommunity Experience - See how the community has reacted to a food via anonymized My Experience ratings.

Once you've eliminated all high FODMAP foods from your diet, you can challenge foods to determine if they work for you.

They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose and galactooligosaccharides, disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols).\r\n\r\nThe term is an acronym, derived from:\r\n\r\n*Fermentable\r\n*Oligo-\r\n*Di-\r\n*Mono-saccharides\r\n*And\r\n*Polyols \r\n\r\nAlthough these specific carbs are naturally present in the foods we eat, diet restriction has been found to improve symptom control in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and other stomach sensitivities. Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage.

This won't be helpful for me and my family, so I uninstalled it.",

Before you scan anything the app asks for your allergies and I put Dairy and then is when I scanned the milk and it said I could have it. Over all this app is NOT a function app."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

If the function is there please let me know where xD I would also like to see a time for logging food. The mood logging is also not super clear.

        "description": "CeliHack - The only gluten free restaurant and meal guide based on real recommendations from people with Celiac!\r\n\r\nCeliHack was created by a Celiac - for Celiacs! It was created to perform as an actual gluten-free dishes collection from restaurants, where all the dishes are uploaded by us - Celiacs!\r\n\r\nSuffering from Celiac disease? Living on a gluten free diet? Here's your solution for eating out! \r\nCeliHack is the best gluten free restaurant guide that is 100% based on actual recommendations! \r\nWhat does this mean? \r\n\r\n- If you enjoyed a delicious and safe gluten-free meal at a Celiac-friendly restaurant - upload your recommendation and let other people know!\r\n\r\n- Had a meal that was supposed to be gluten free but suffered from Celiac side effects afterwards? Warn other people!\r\n\r\n- Want to have a gluten free breakfast, lunch or dinner at a restaurant and you don't know which you can really trust? With CeliHack you can find out where Celiacs near you ate and marked as safe! \r\n\r\nAre you a Celiac too? Download the app and help us build the world's biggest gluten free dishes collection! \r\n\r\nMain advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Presenting not just a list of restaurants which claim to serve gluten-free dishes, but actually showing those dishes, photographed and uploaded by other Celiacs who ate the dishes and shared how they felt after doing so!\r\n\r\n2. Based on the wisdom of the crowd: each user can comment on others’ recommendations. So, if someone uploaded a dish that you already ate and had a different experience with it (for better or worse), you can add your review to the existing “dish card” and notify others about your experience too. \r\n\r\n3. The app may change the way restaurants handle our food… maybe they don’t even know their GF dishes are not actually GF.\r\n\r\n4. Since the database should be built by us - Celiacs - it’s worldwide and can help us anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to start making a difference, we need volunteers to start uploading gluten-free dishes in their location. Since the app is new, it pretty much has no dishes in it, so you’ll probably see this empty screen when first opening it, asking you to start contributing content… We hope you will!\r\n\r\nThe app is free and will ALWAYS be free to Celiacs!\r\n\r\nIf we all cooperate and share our recommendations - we’ll bring traffic to the restaurants which take care of us, and it may convince the ones who don’t to start doing so too!\r\n\r\nPlease help us by uploading dishes to the app. A strong worldwide community will help us all by raising awareness! \r\n\r\nHow can you give back to the community?\r\n\r\n- Opened the app in a place where no one has uploaded a dish before? Be the first to upload a dish there and help future visitors! \r\n- Got sick from eating, but not sure it is from gluten? Report it (anonymously) anyway; if the restaurant is good, others will balance it out in the future with their reviews.\r\n- Came across inappropriate content (e.g. photo or text) in the app? Report the dish.\r\n- Most importantly, keep sharing gluten free dishes you ate out and tell other Celiacs how you felt after the meal. \r\n\r\nCelihack Features include:\r\n\r\n- Swipe through real recommendations of meals and choose if you like it or don’t like it\r\n- Add meals to ‘My Favorites’ and save for when you get hungry and want to eat at a safe Celiac friendly restaurant\r\n- Upload your own recommendations or rejections after eating a gluten free meal\r\n- Find Celiac friendly restaurants near you\r\n\r\nWith CaliHack you can easily find gluten friendly restaurants around you!

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",
            "I use it for my IBS and how bloated I am etc good reminder."

        "description": "CeliHack - The only gluten free restaurant and meal guide based on real recommendations from people with Celiac!\r\n\r\nCeliHack was created by a Celiac - for Celiacs! It was created to perform as an actual gluten-free dishes collection from restaurants, where all the dishes are uploaded by us - Celiacs!\r\n\r\nSuffering from Celiac disease? Living on a gluten free diet? Here's your solution for eating out! \r\nCeliHack is the best gluten free restaurant guide that is 100% based on actual recommendations! \r\nWhat does this mean? \r\n\r\n- If you enjoyed a delicious and safe gluten-free meal at a Celiac-friendly restaurant - upload your recommendation and let other people know!\r\n\r\n- Had a meal that was supposed to be gluten free but suffered from Celiac side effects afterwards? Warn other people!\r\n\r\n- Want to have a gluten free breakfast, lunch or dinner at a restaurant and you don't know which you can really trust? With CeliHack you can find out where Celiacs near you ate and marked as safe! \r\n\r\nAre you a Celiac too? Download the app and help us build the world's biggest gluten free dishes collection! \r\n\r\nMain advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Presenting not just a list of restaurants which claim to serve gluten-free dishes, but actually showing those dishes, photographed and uploaded by other Celiacs who ate the dishes and shared how they felt after doing so!\r\n\r\n2. Based on the wisdom of the crowd: each user can comment on others’ recommendations. So, if someone uploaded a dish that you already ate and had a different experience with it (for better or worse), you can add your review to the existing “dish card” and notify others about your experience too. \r\n\r\n3. The app may change the way restaurants handle our food… maybe they don’t even know their GF dishes are not actually GF.\r\n\r\n4. Since the database should be built by us - Celiacs - it’s worldwide and can help us anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to start making a difference, we need volunteers to start uploading gluten-free dishes in their location. Since the app is new, it pretty much has no dishes in it, so you’ll probably see this empty screen when first opening it, asking you to start contributing content… We hope you will!\r\n\r\nThe app is free and will ALWAYS be free to Celiacs!\r\n\r\nIf we all cooperate and share our recommendations - we’ll bring traffic to the restaurants which take care of us, and it may convince the ones who don’t to start doing so too!\r\n\r\nPlease help us by uploading dishes to the app. A strong worldwide community will help us all by raising awareness! \r\n\r\nHow can you give back to the community?\r\n\r\n- Opened the app in a place where no one has uploaded a dish before? Be the first to upload a dish there and help future visitors! \r\n- Got sick from eating, but not sure it is from gluten? Report it (anonymously) anyway; if the restaurant is good, others will balance it out in the future with their reviews.\r\n- Came across inappropriate content (e.g. photo or text) in the app? Report the dish.\r\n- Most importantly, keep sharing gluten free dishes you ate out and tell other Celiacs how you felt after the meal. \r\n\r\nCelihack Features include:\r\n\r\n- Swipe through real recommendations of meals and choose if you like it or don’t like it\r\n- Add meals to ‘My Favorites’ and save for when you get hungry and want to eat at a safe Celiac friendly restaurant\r\n- Upload your own recommendations or rejections after eating a gluten free meal\r\n- Find Celiac friendly restaurants near you\r\n\r\nWith CaliHack you can easily find gluten friendly restaurants around you!

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",
            "I use it for my IBS and how bloated I am etc good reminder."

            "I began using this app when my doctor recommended I do the low fodmap diet for 6 weeks. I thought this would make shopping for specific foods a lot easier. Boy, was I wrong. It is not accurate when you scan items in the store. For example, I would scan items, and it would say to avoid this item because of a certain ingredient in it, like soy. I would then look at the ingredients on the product and nowhere would it be listed. I would not recommend this app.",
            "So far so good! My only suggestion would be to add a filter menu to searches / scanned items / lists, which provides options for sorting by food groups, brands, descending/ascending number rating, and excellent, good, poor, etc. matches only. As it is, looking through lists and searches is a nightmare when you have a LOT of items to look through. Another helpful feature would be to add an option to filter out duplicate items in searches--I once had a search give me 10+ dupes for several items.",
            "I was reluntant at first to try this app due to a lot of negative reviews and comments. I just found out some food allergies that is includes in lots of foods, such as wheat, and this app is a good help. It also helps with other ingredients you want to avoid, such as sugar, etc. It even shows you foods that will be good for you to choose that disclides everything, which is good for someone new to a bad allergy trying to find new foods to eat. So far, I love this app"

        "description": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.\r\n\r\nGluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten.[10] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak.\r\n\r\nGluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.\r\n\r\nA gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. Furthermore, they contain protein of higher nutritional quality than those of wheat, and in greater quantities.\r\n\r\nFeedback:-\r\nIf you have any suggested features or improvement, please leave a comment.

        "descriptionHTML": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.<br><br>Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten.[10] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.<br><br>In addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak.<br><br>Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.<br><br>A gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. Furthermore, they contain protein of higher nutritional quality than those of wheat, and in greater quantities.<br><br>Feedback:-<br>If you have any suggested features or improvement, please leave a comment.

Or do you want to find out if it is gluten-free or suitable for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)? Well, just ask Ingrid!  Ingrid is your companion in everyday life with food intolerances. She gives you information about the tolerability, the amount of fructose, lactose, sorbitol, gluten, histamine or FODMAP in your food. \r\n Download the free app and adjust your personal intolerances. Ingrid shows you all the important information. The information is based on scientific findings and the food ratings are developed in collaboration with the experts of the Austrian charity “Society for Public Health”. Ingrid also shows you how well individual foods are tolerated by other people. So the community results let you see, how other patients tolerated that foods.  *** Scientific data *** The data come from the “Society for Public Health”. This project has been researching intolerance for many years and has created the basis for Ingrid with a special food intolerance database.

        "description": "Para personas quien tienen desordenes relacionados al gluten [enfermedad celiaca (EC), sensibilidad al gluten no-celiaca, o dermatitis herpetiforme, lo cual es una manifestación en la piel de la EC], es necesario evitar el gluten para razones de salud. Gluten es el nombre genérico para ciertos tipos de proteínas que se encuentran en los granos trigo, cebada, centeno, y sus derivados. Cuando una persona con enfermedad celiaca ingiere gluten, ocurre una reacción inmune, lo cual daña el intestino delgado y puede causar síntomas y problemas de salud en casi cualquier parte del cuerpo. Aún cantidades muy pequeñas de gluten pueden causar problemas, independiente de que hay síntomas obvios o no. En cuanto a la sensibilidad al gluten no-celiaca, esta es una condición que todavía no está bien entendida, pero parece que el consumo de gluten no causa el mismo tipo de daño al intestino como es el caso en la enfermedad celiaca. Sin embargo, es también necesario eliminar el gluten de la dieta, ya que su consumo tiene diversos efectos adversos en la salud.\r\n\r\nLos siguientes granos, tal como derivados e híbridos de estos granos tienen que ser eliminados de la dieta:\r\nTrigo – incluye variedades como: duro, espelta, emmer, sémola, farro, y einkorn.\r\nCebada\r\nCenteno\r\nEscoge granos y harinas que son naturalmente sin-gluten, incluyendo arroz, maíz, soya, papa, tapioca, sorgo, quinua, mijo, trigo sarraceno, yuca, arrurruz, coco, tef, lino, chía y harinas de frijoles y nueces.\r\nInvestigaciones científicas indican que avena pura y no contaminada con gluten consumida en cantidades moderadas (hasta ½ taza de avena seca por dia), es tolerada por la mayoría de las personas con enfermedad celiaca. Escoge avena no contaminada que es certificada sin gluten, y consulte con su médico o dietista antes de incluir la avena en su dieta.\r\nOtros alimentos que naturalmente no contienen gluten son frutas y verduras; carnes frescas, aves, y pescado; frijoles y lentejas, nueces y semillas; y productos lácteos sencillos. Estos alimentos en sus formas puras no contienen gluten. Versiones procesados o con sabores agregados pueden contener ingredientes con gluten.\r\nExisten sustitutos sin gluten para alimentos que comúnmente son hechos de trigo, y son ampliamente disponibles en supermercados, tiendas de alimentos naturales, directamente de los fabricantes, y de sitios en el internet.\r\nBebidas alcohólicas destiladas, vinagres destilados, y vino son seguros para incluir en la dieta sin gluten. La mayoría de las cervezas, cerveza Inglesa y bebidas malteadas son hechos a base de granos que contienen gluten y NO son sin-gluten. Cervezas hechas de granos sin-gluten, como el sorgo, son sin-gluten.\r\n \r\n\r\nEtiquetado de Alimentos: Como determinar si un producto es libre de gluten\r\nPara seguir una dieta sin gluten con éxito, es muy importante leer las etiquetas de alimentos procesadas cuidadosamente. Esto incluye afirmaciones de “gluten-free” en los paquetes, tal como listados de ingredientes. Ya que los ingredientes se pueden cambiar en cualquier momento, es importante leer las etiquetas cada vez que haga sus compras.\r\n\r\nUna clave para entender la dieta libre del gluten es poder convertirse en un buen lector de etiquetas de alimentos. Esto incluye tanto afirmaciones de “sin-gluten,” igual como listados de ingredientes.",

En cuanto a la sensibilidad al gluten no-celiaca, esta es una condición que todavía no está bien entendida, pero parece que el consumo de gluten no causa el mismo tipo de daño al intestino como es el caso en la enfermedad celiaca. Sin embargo, es también necesario eliminar el gluten de la dieta, ya que su consumo tiene diversos efectos adversos en la salud.<br><br>Los siguientes granos, tal como derivados e híbridos de estos granos tienen que ser eliminados de la dieta:<br>Trigo – incluye variedades como: duro, espelta, emmer, sémola, farro, y einkorn.<br>Cebada<br>Centeno<br>Escoge granos y harinas que son naturalmente sin-gluten, incluyendo arroz, maíz, soya, papa, tapioca, sorgo, quinua, mijo, trigo sarraceno, yuca, arrurruz, coco, tef, lino, chía y harinas de frijoles y nueces.<br>Investigaciones científicas indican que avena pura y no contaminada con gluten consumida en cantidades moderadas (hasta ½ taza de avena seca por dia), es tolerada por la mayoría de las personas con enfermedad celiaca. Escoge avena no contaminada que es certificada sin gluten, y consulte con su médico o dietista antes de incluir la avena en su dieta.<br>Otros alimentos que naturalmente no contienen gluten son frutas y verduras; carnes frescas, aves, y pescado; frijoles y lentejas, nueces y semillas; y productos lácteos sencillos. Estos alimentos en sus formas puras no contienen gluten. Versiones procesados o con sabores agregados pueden contener ingredientes con gluten.<br>Existen sustitutos sin gluten para alimentos que comúnmente son hechos de trigo, y son ampliamente disponibles en supermercados, tiendas de alimentos naturales, directamente de los fabricantes, y de sitios en el internet.<br>Bebidas alcohólicas destiladas, vinagres destilados, y vino son seguros para incluir en la dieta sin gluten. La mayoría de las cervezas, cerveza Inglesa y bebidas malteadas son hechos a base de granos que contienen gluten y NO son sin-gluten. Cervezas hechas de granos sin-gluten, como el sorgo, son sin-gluten.<br> <br><br>Etiquetado de Alimentos: Como determinar si un producto es libre de gluten<br>Para seguir una dieta sin gluten con éxito, es muy importante leer las etiquetas de alimentos procesadas cuidadosamente. Esto incluye afirmaciones de “gluten-free” en los paquetes, tal como listados de ingredientes. Ya que los ingredientes se pueden cambiar en cualquier momento, es importante leer las etiquetas cada vez que haga sus compras.<br><br>Una clave para entender la dieta libre del gluten es poder convertirse en un buen lector de etiquetas de alimentos. Esto incluye tanto afirmaciones de “sin-gluten,” igual como listados de ingredientes.",

            "I've had a great experience with this app! The food is delicious and easy to cook. I absolutely love the shopping list feature. One thing I would really like is for an actual breakdown of how many grams of food each person should eat. For example, it tells me that I should eat 44% of the food, but we usually use a bit more ingredients than the recipe calls for (ie., Using 2lbs of meat instead of 1.75 lbs). Having an actual weight for the nutrition breakdown would be immensely helpful.",
            "I like this app but it needs some work to make it more user friendly. Like once you make a dish from your weekly menu you should be able to check it off. I love the shopping list and pantry feature, but how about letting me add stuff to the shopping list so that I don't have to have two lists?",
            "So far I am super impressed I am on an elimination diet and suspected to be sensitive to garlic. I listed garlic and garlic salt as an ingredient to avoid. My first experience with the suggested meals at Whole Foods, the kielbasa and substitutes all had garlic salt. I had to put back the ingredients for that meal when I canceled it. I lost time but I also saved a lot of time with the shopping list feature, It's amazing! Please consider integrating with Lose it!",
            "The layout and concept of the meal plans is great. However I accidentally created a meal plan and it won't let me delete it. I can only create a new one but then the ingredients are based off the previous meal plan that was created by accident and I can't reset it. I would contact support but they don't offer in app support?",
            "this is a great plan, for me personally. love the recipes, qiuck, easy and oh ao tasty. I don't stick to it like the bible, but use it as a tool to fit my lifestyle and it helps keep me on track. I'm down a total of 25 lbs in a yr 1/2 . it's definitely a lifestyle change. I totally recommend! Thanks Christine and coaches!"

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

            "Opened database relies on people data feeds. Product addition requires 2 minutes with training. Above nutrition facts and labels, you get NOVA food classification (i.e. 4 processing levels defined by UN), vegan compliance and palm oil flags. You can build your product lists. You can review scanned products later (/ local logs). If you don't want to rely on advertising and don't have enough time to inspect packaging, you should try it.",

Because it's yeast that's dried with no additives, flavourings, colourings, added salt etc? I hope so any great source of B12 for vegans :)",

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "Game-changer for me. I'm not a good cook and it's probably the only place I've found where ingredient quantities are just right in general (and expressed in metric units!). Also the instructions are easy to follow and timing fits well. I now eat more varied, grocery shopping is way easier and I waste less food.",
            "I am obsessed with this app! Here are the top reasons I love it: - It is so easy to use. - It is aesthetically pleasing. - It compiles a grocery list for you that you can add to. - The way that the recipe pages are laid out is GOLD. 👌 I don't have to scroll through a blog. I can click on three sections (utensils needed, ingredients needed, and instructions (with ingredients listed underneath so that I'm not having to click back and forth). - Etc.",
            "So far amazing. This is my first week using the app and I'm honestly just loving it. This app curbs my nasty habit of over shopping at the grocery store and yet still forgetting some essential items. I don't have to research recipes that fit into my Keto lifestyle, it's all layed out for me. Just click, and go. I'm honestly shocked at how easy it is to use and how incredibly helpful it is. This is not your turn of the mill list app or meal app. It's all here!",
            "Absolutely five stars. Easy interface, you add recipes to your plan and it automatically generates a categorized grocery list for you. Gone are the days of running around the grocery store grabbing useless stuff that goes to waste, and wasting money. I've been using this app for about 2 months and I'll never go back. I've been using the free version up until now, but I'm about to pay for the premium subscription because it truly is just that good. No, this is in no way an ad.",
            "This app has really helped me and my husband start to meal plan. I've tried to meal plan multiple times and just can't stick to it or it takes up too much time. Having the gluten free option definitely helps as well (celiac here) so thanks for including that! I've thought about going for the pro version but a yearly cost of about £50 is a bit much. I'd maybe consider a one off payment of that, or maybe if it was paying per meal bundle (since I'm assuming that's why it's a yearly payment)."

            "Needs a better database in Australia. I've contributed several things but nearly every food item in my pantry needs manual input. Maybe you guys could crawl the web for products sold over here. Our 2 major supermarkets are Coles and Woolworths. Upon further investigation, you seem to be using / sharing a database with openfood facts. Not sure if you have the ability to manually add items.",

            "I love this app! It really helps me to make better choices when I do the groceries. It's easy to use, the only thing is that many products are still not known in their database.",
            "perfect app... need to expend to the Whole europe. here in Poland i can't even add new product. aparently. I am stuck at the \"Validation of the Ingredients\" picture.... 🤷 maybe it doesnt reconised the language 🤔. looking forward to have an update like this 😎",
            "I really like this app. I live the design and the idea but it has 1 major flaw. The fact that people are able to manually contribute additional items that were not in the system before is a GREAT idea and I love it but at the same time it comes with a problem. The app base it's ratings off of 100g of the item however when people input the nutritional data they will use the number that are listed on the product which often are based on a different number of grams. This causes bad data."

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

Super visual si eliges u tipo de alerta (lactosa por ejemplo) te saca en rojo si el producto escaneado lo tiene como ingrediente. De verdad muy muy útil tanto si tienes alergias o intolerancia como si quieres realmente saber que contiene lo que comes y no tienes una lupa a mano! Ademas te saca los productos relacionados pero en \"bueno para mi\", por ejemplo un pan de molde sin aceite de palma. Me encanta y lo estoy recomendando a mi grupo de intolerancia",
            "Fantástico, tiene un montón de productos (la mayoría de los que he probado) y ofrece un montón de información, incluso te explica para qué sirven los aditivos.  Imprescindible para gente con intolerancias. Por sacarle algún defecto, la interfaz no es de lo más bonito, pero merece la pena.",

            "In general, a really good app with lots of functionality. It would be nice if the font stood out more. I feel like I'm always squinting at the screen. Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",
            "This is the app you want to get if you are going to go on a keto diet. I liked it so much I bought the paid version. It has helped me lose 76 pounds and still losing weight. Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",
            "Love this tracker it is beyond easy and intuitive. Save recipes, copy anything to any day you want. Scan barcodes. Set up meal reminders and anything else you might need in a simple easy to read design. I \"WAS\" using 'my fitness pal' but seriously Carb Manager gives for free what MFP wanted me to pay $50 a year for.... CM is the best and I recommend it to everyone on keto or not because it's just that amazing to use & you DON'T need to pay!!"

I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",

It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",

            "I had this app years ago and it worked really well. Downloaded it last week and it seems to be a lot more troublesome now. When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",

            "I've been using this app since July and have always loved it. However since the last update, I have to manually enter/ search for everything each time as the feature for remembering previous foods/drinks no longer works. It's a bit inconvenient since a lot of my things have to be scanned. Also, the different options for measuring (gram, cup, tablespoon, etc) is missing on lots of items which makes it hard to be accurate when you only have 1 option.",
            "Its great! I like that it has an extensive food list, I can keep track of all my measurements and see trend breakdowns. Love the recipes too! App functions better than others that I have tried. Nothing glitch-y or slow loading screen. Easy to use! The information entered is correct! I have used other apps, where when you put in the food item, it will have completely wrong carb information. Drove me nuts! The price is better also, some other apps want you to pay $10.00 a month or like $60 yearly.",
            "I have tried many apps while looking for a tracker. This has been the best one! I love the search on the database, it's concise and easy to locate items. Recent searches show up first. One of my favorite features is that you are able to select the measurement of food instead of converting from grams or guessing how many pork rinds are in 14 grams. It is really easy to customize the macros to suit your personal goals. You can also add foods by scanning a bar code. Great app! Money well spent.",
            "I've tried different keto apps, but this one is by far the best. Not only can I easily keep track of my calories, fats and carbs but the app helps me keep track of my water intake and moods as well. This is my favorite app for my keto lifestyle. I've tried keto several times in my life and have been semi successful. The only thing missing was this app. I feel that with this app, I'll be able to monitor my food intake better, monitor my carbs better and ensure better success for myself.",
            "Just started using this app the first of August 2020. But so far it's great! Easy to use. Just enter the foods you eat and the app tracks the macros and keeps up with your daily intake. 10/17/20 Just did an update. Do NOT like it. Can't find foods I've used for 2 months. The app randomly changes the macros on the exact same item. Multiple issues with the update.Had to go down to 3 stars. I want to go back to the old one I had."

            "Great app - love the scan feature. I do wish it was more intuitive for food entry and that you had the option to change something once you've entered it. I will often enter everything I plan to eat *before* I eat it to make sure I don't inadvertently exceed my allotments, but sometimes don't finish it all. If there is a way to do this I haven't found it, but it could be user error. 🤷‍♀️"

Dr Greger is a genuinely good person who was inspired by his grandmother beating cancer and has shared her tips in this easy to use, free app!!",
            "this app is wonderful. i am a huge fan of Dr. G,. his work to improve the health of the planet is such a blessing and a totally free gift~ that is true altruism and genuine compassion. the app takes me about 25 seconds to do and its an awesome way to remind me the holes in my diet to be mindful of filling. its a thing of beauty! and i thank him and his staff😀🌷🌞! I stand by everything I said earlier in my first review, but PLEAZE bring back the vit D box &above all THE FULL SCREEN SUN BURST!!",
            "I don't write much reviews but this is one of the best apps I have used. It's simple and effective, with lots of useful and wonderful information. My daily life has become an adventure of exploring and discovering new food and vegetables and it has changed my life for better. Thank you Dr. Greger 🌱🍑🥦🙂",
            "Great way to approach what you are eating (what should I include in my diet as opposed to what shouldn't I eat. All of these foods have plethora of data supporting their ability to fight disease. App gamifies eating healthier (how many checkboxes can you get for how many days), free, well formatted.",
            "Exceptional app. Easy to use. So practical, taking much of the stress away from daily food choices. I recommend this over any other system/plan I've come across for eating a plant-based diet or just eating healthier."

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a keto diet plan is the amount of carbohydrates and proteins allowed on a daily basis.

Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight fast and consistently. However, scientific research suggests that ketosis goes further than that, such as lowering your blood pressure, risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, improving skin conditions and dental health, mood stabilization, and increasing energy levels.\r\n\r\nMyKeto = A Keto Diet Guide, Keto Macro Calculator & Low Carb Diet Tracker :\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n-Basics: Zero to Low-Carb, High Fat, Moderate to High Protein – Dropping into Ketosis.\r\n-Benefits: Backed by scientific studies, not by fad homeopathic guru practitioners.\r\n-Side-Effects: Yes, a low carb keto diet is not completely awesome.\r\n-Debunk Myths: Large amounts of fat, especially saturated fat, can’t be healthy, right?

            "Excellent app. I have been using this app for 2 + years now. It allows me to set my own goals and adjust them over time as my needs change. It has a extensive library of fresh and packaged foods (scanning or key in) plus the ability to create my personal meals for quick one click addition for daily tracking. With the added ability to track water, blood glucose, weight, ketones, exercise, etc. plus add personal notes, this has proven to be an indispensable tool. If only I could perform as well."

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

I've been using this app for more than 6 months and it has helped me to keep away the weight I have lost doing the keto diet. The app calculate the suggested macros based off of your goals, current body type, and amount of exercise you do in a week. It also has a water intake tracker, which is a very nice extra. I've used this app every single day, almost religiously. 5/5!",

Although we have only been using this a short time, compared to a lot of other apps we looked at, this one is simple straightforward and uncluttered. We find it very easy to work with and meet our needs completely. So far we both give this a major thumbs up. Keto macro goals are easy to set, food consumed is easy to enter, activity levels and water consumed are easy and weight hopefully lost is equally easy to enter. very nice app"

I can put up with banner ads and am happy to add my own food details, but the update on March 6th has added full page video ads that you have to watch for 5secs before you can skip. I had 2 of them in 1 session, that kills the app for me."

I for one don't have every single ingredient ever made out of animal products memorized as they can be unrecognizable words, so this app is immensely helpful!",

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",

The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications.

            "I really like this app! It is probably the best app I've used so far, but there are two problems. 1. My totals keep disappearing from my dashboard. And it just shows zero for my macros. This usually happens after I enter my dinner. 2. I am having trouble entering some items. I tried making a recipe and wanted to add 1/2 cup of stevia. I couldn't change the measurements from tsp to cup. That is a bit annoying. I hope to figure it out.",
            "The tracker helps enormously: the ability to tweak menus in order to maximize protein, minimize carbs, and contain fats and calories is truly valuable. I have used Atkins occasionally over the years in order to catch a modest weight gain before it gets out of hand. In the past, it meant looking every mouthful up. With the tracker, I have so much more control and, indeed, motivation. This time, I'd gained ten pounds that I really didn't want! Using the tracker, six of them are gone. Yay!",
            "I love this app! It helps me get to my goals. Shows me if I need to eat more protein, or drink more water, etc. I can view my history and lots more on the dashboard. And best of all it is easy to use. Great job Atkins! PS so far I am down 15 lbs in 7 weeks.",
            "Tracking my carbs with this app helps keep me on track. So far, I've lost 19 pounds. I've gone from a size 8 to a size 2. 😁 Love it!! They also offer recipes to help you and the discussion board is very helpful. I would give it more stars if I could.",
            "I enjoy the recent improvement to track exercise beyond steps. Other ideas to get a well rounded caloric info should include sleep, working (standing vs sitting), meditation and other non cardio or resistance activities."

            "This app really helps to follow my nutrition. I love it and I use it every single day. I already recommended it to my friends. Thanks to the app and to many workouts, I reached my first weight-goal. There are some things that are missing though- for instance, now that I reached my goal, I would like to change my weight goal and I want that the app will adjust the amount of nutrients accordingly, but I don't see such an option. Because I don't know alone how to decide how much I need to eat a day",
            "Pros: Simple, straightforward tracking of macronutrient and water consumption. Free to use. Cons: it's simplicity means that users will have to weigh or measure everything they eat. The database is lacking in comparison with its peers. They have ways and means to estimate consumption e. g. Being able to look up a small banana and use the given average size, or log weighed measures. No tracking of micronutrients. No assistance. These shortcomings mean the app works well but, doesn't have enough.",

Advert sometimes covers the bottom food selection so it can't be seen or selected; the search function needs improvement to help sift through sometimes erratically labelled database (e.g. \"chicken broiled\" should search for all instances where both words appear not only intances where they appear exactly as written); the time for the meal should default to the last set time; there should be in-app option to give feedback like this."

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book 😭 I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

I can login on the website, but the app says it's invalid. I tried resetting my password in the app. After inputting my email to reset I get the error \"There was a problem...\". Yeah, no kidding. While I can see the pollen rating for the day with the widget, the rest of the app is useless.",
            "I used to really like this app. Since the Covid pandemic, I feel that this app has missed the accuracy for many months. I've had this app for years and I have never seen this before. Just wish we knew why it's changed so much. If I'm wrong, I apologize, but it just doesn't seem to be the same as it was. Watch the prediction and see how far it is almost every day.",
            "This app is not at all accurate. Its pollen level readings do not jibe with the readings that are given on the local TV weather forecasts, and with most people's allergy symptoms. For example, now in mid October at this location we are having high levels of ragweed and mountain cedar (juniper) pollen, but the app shows the levels as very low, 0.8 or lower. This app not useful.",
            "I have now been able to download and use the app. It works fine. I do wish I did not have to keep going online to get the info everytime I turn off the phone to charge it. Other than this I thank you for making it available.",
            "I've been using this app for a long time and it's accurate for my area and I have lots of allergies so it's been really helpful."

It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",

            "It is really simple to use and let's you add all the info you want to. Which most apps don't. However, one thing that is a bit Irish is the drinks and snack sections. Seeing as the snack section has the water and coffee in it, And that's it!!! (No squash, juice, tea...) I presume the drinks section is for alcohol?!? It doesn't really make sense. Either the snack section is for snacks and the drink section for drinks or add a drink tick chart in each section. With breakfast, lunch, dinner...",
            "Simple entry food diary, not for tracking calories. Good for people who eat out and have drinks and want to keep track of those things. I like it just for the purpose of remembering what I consume and being able to look back on the day to reflect on what I need to add to or omit from my diet.",
            "Great app if you want something very simple and clean to log your meals on. No calorie counting. No portions to enter. No searching a database to find the right food.... just type it in and go. Its exactly what I needed to help me log and commit my meals for bright line eating on the go.",
            "Nice and simple... I usually make mine into bullets for easier review (simple enough to do oneself), but I'd love if there were a way to either review or download each day of logs. The app works perfectly for my purposes right now, but if working with a nutritionist or something, being able to send the info for a day, a week, etc would be a huge assist, even if it were just some kind of full-day review screen that I could screen shot. Otherwise, no complaints, aside from the annoying adds😉",
            "I love it! It's so simple. Other apps count down your calories and that makes for anxiety. This just allows you to write anything you want in the notes field. Some days I track veggies, others calories, still others protein. It's so simple and this, so versatile."

You may find out that your chronic headaches causes is celiac disease, lactose intolerance, allergy to gluten, pollens, dust or other allergens, chrons disease, or that they are symptoms of stress (stress headaches).

Different diaries allows you to record any event with a simple calendar.<br>- Statistics: analyze symptoms frequency, and perform triage on yourself: are you feeling sick very often? Did you forget a pill? Is your workout calendar on track? Are you developing good weekly or monthly habits? Are you eating health food often enough? Everything is under control.<br>- Correlation analysis: discover if you are allergic to anything, and how you can change habits to improve health, or improve pain management. Learn what makes you sick or give you issues and cut it from your diet / routine / habits.<br>- Export data: export your food log / pain journal / diet log / symptom diary, save it or share it.<br>- Develop healthy habits: when you track habits and you discover that they help you feel better, go for it!

            "Would be great if the app gave the option to track the time along with the date of the symptom. The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",
            "The app is quite good but you need to add more functions and more details, add stuff that would keep your customers motivated to use it. E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",
            "Quite impressed but the calendar could do with improvement, need to be able to set a time for items and have a repeat options. But all in all it seems pretty good.",
            "Weird unintuitive interface, doesn't allow you to select more than 1 item e.g. when I add activity it deselect mood and it won't generate a list of items you've selected. Doesn't make any sense.",
            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

            "Just begun using it I like the history where you can just pick a previous meal, so you don't need to input each meal. I like it great so far. Think the portions need to be more flexible as 1 serving of raw food like sliced onions hard to judge if it's a portion or not. Just a small gripe tho",
            "Great, would recommend. Only problem is the icon is not super sharp, and might be out of date for the new icon shape design Google updated. Other than that, it looks good and polished within the app",
            "Great data base, but few bugs. Like the barcode that won't work until rebooting the app and the today's planning that get all empty when starting the app. Also it's just an historic of my meals, it would be great to prepare them in advance for the coming weeks.",
            "I'm pretty new to be rating this app, but I like what it is bringing to the table. I'm using the premium version and thought the price was low enough to pick up the extra features of menus and advice. Content is very helpful. Taking a photo and getting feedback is innovative and I think will be stronger as more people use. Having issues with font size in database being a bit large to see full descriptions. Seeing a lot of potential!",
            "Unless you're sure you want to pay for the whole year, go ahead with the supposedly \"7-day Free trial\". They will charge you at the moment of the subscription to the trial. I contacted Foodvisor support and Play Google, and neither validated my complaint. It is highly deceiving for users to tell they can try the app but charge them the full amount right away. I don't know how Google allows this type of practice."

            "Good feature set, but pretty much useless for anything except tracking period and symptoms if you are not temping: even with clear cervical fluid patterns, it will not estimate when ovulation happened on a particular past month. Edit: thank you for your quick answer! Yes, I know cervical fluid is not enough information to compute the ovulation day, but I would expect a sort of estimate like \"based on your inputs, ovulation might have happened on CD x\".",
            "Have used it for years. Used it for 2 of my babies so far. It helps me know where I am in my cycle. I can compare my current cycles from cycles years ago. It all stays in the app for recording purposes.",
            "The app is suddenly not working for me... Got a networking issue in the app, but I can connect to the Web site directly. Not sure what went wrong.",
            "Please what's the problem with app network these days? Overall a very great app so far.",

It continiously tells me I might be pregnant, even in the middle of my period (and, as someone going through fertility treatment, it's made me cry twice because the ads push that I would be pregnant if I had just bought premium), it has no algorithm to adapt to cycles and is stuck on an insane 20 day cycle, and the UI hasn't been updated since the 90s."

            "The app is great and surprisingly I could find many kbeauty products in the database. Only downside being that when I add a product to the database I can only do so using the camera to take a photo I cannot upload the image from my gallery which makes it troublesome especially with kbeauty products that do not show ingredient list in English on the actual product",
            "Please insert a ingredient searching option, where i can copy-paste the ingredient list and you can scan and give me the solution about which ingredient is pore clogging and which is not. The biggest complain about your app is that it does not cover all the products, and i have faced the same problems. By checking the ingredients, you dont need to cover or include all the products, just check their ingredients.",
            "I'm relatively new to the app and I find it really useful. It really helped me defining a proper skincare routine. The interface is easy, has potential if some features can be improved. For instance, I agree with a previous review about being able to create specific lists of products instead of adding it as favourites because I like to try new products and my skincare needs can change depending on the seasons (I have mixed skin).",
            "This app is awesome. It helped me realize how much bad stuff I put on my skin and helped me choose better ones. Finally I don't feel lost when I look at ingredients. The lot of chemicals can be really confusing and it's hard to decide which ones are good or bad. Now I just take my phone and check them. Thank you."

I just feel stuck as this has a lot of my journey stored here but would not recommend at this point in time.",
            "I really like the simplistic idea behind this app, but fact like basic foods like raisins and quark are missing, and there's no food search function (you have swipe to find the right item), makes it difficult to commit to it. Even though I like the food icons and thr cute visuals, UI is way too cluttered. Finally, measurements are not always consistent in each food (eg. No gram unit available in all foods). I'd be happy to try this app on it's next iterations to see if they fixed these points.",
            "I had given this 5 stars. I even paid for the premium version in 2017. But then there was an update, and the premium version stopped. The ads have returned and the app lost some functionality. I'm not going to keep paying for new premium versions after every update.",

            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",

However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",

Needless to say carving out the time for a full fitness routine is a struggle. Thankfully Centr takes care of all the planning and tells you EXACTLY what to do and how to do it with an incredibly easy to use interface. They even get your kids involved with some of the activities. I've been at it 30 days now and def notice an improvement in muscle gain and overall health.",
            "I thought that this app was a great way for me to try and bulk up my body. Definitely made me feel like I was striving for a new me. I only wish that this app would track your weight and do some before and after photos. Or it could definitely make some monthly or weekly progress notifications. Other than that. This app is definitely great. 👍",
            "Totally recommend a subscription. There are SO many workouts to choose from with various levels of strength/endurance. I love that you can see how long the workout is and for many of the programs, you can see what exercises yoy will be doing ahead of time. Includes recipes too. Great value.",
            "Excellent app. I'm not fit and I keep up with every exercises. Many different level options. Entertaining and fun coaches. I recommend it!",
            "This app has great workouts and I have found the coached workouts are easy to follow. The recipes are fairly easy to follow and its improved my breakfast game. The reason it doesn't get five stars is because it's really lacking in personalization. It doesn't help you tract your weight or personalize the meal plan to your height/weight/gender/activity level. As is, the meal plan portion of the app is highly lacking for what you pay for the app. I do really love the workouts though."

            "Some good low carb recipes BUT app seems to have been thrown together / rushed. Some quantities missing in recipes ( eg: Salad Sandwich: avocado/ cheese/ etc..how much??), so unsure how carbs given can possibly be accurate. Uses oz/ lbs ( non metric) so lost if using in Australia etc..Typos in recipe headers also shows this app was rushed. \" sparagus\"? etc..\" HOME\" menu option doesn't seem to work? Needs revision. Nice try.",
            "Android users were the last to have the diet doctor keto recipes app. As much as I like the idea that I can now access recipes. I find the app to be a bit boring. It's not very planned due to the fact that it doesn't have any meal plan access, nor can one see any nutrients facts. Hopefully there'll be more to this app. Thanks for your understanding.",
            "Good and easy recipes. I am giving only 2* because: there's no way to SAVE your recipes and there's no way to SHARE them. Also takes long open and asks for 5 stars. Please fix it and you'll get 5*. The app has great potential but now is somewhat annoying to use! I'm happy to pay for ads-free version with regular features like saving and sharing.",
            "This app has been great so far! It's simple, relatively user friendly, and there are lots of recipes to choose from. There are, however, a couple of suggestions I'd like to make. Firstly, it would be nice to have the option to save recipes for later. Secondly, it would be useful if the recipes could be ordered by level of difficulty."

            "Love the app!! It connects to my Google Fit and let's me log my exercises and blood pressure, and in the app itself I can log my glucose levels, weight and everything I eat. I also love all the recipe suggestions and the help. The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because all the food doesn't have the option of logging in grams which is much more accurate than other measurement (in my opinion), and it doesn't allow you to log precise amounts in any measurement unit (45.2gr., 3.6oz, etc.).",
            "Pretty good app overall but as this is user based for inputting nutritional information there are incorrect amounts for carbs. If I scan something that is 3 net carbs and someone has mistakenly put same item as 18 carbs then I cannot edit, nor can I just put it in properly myself. So in a nutshell NOT accurate. Add editing and I would rate it a 5 easily.",
            "I love the concept of this app, but I struggled so much tracking my meals. So many foods were innacurate or labeled with wrong measurments. I'm sure it's difficult to maintain, but I had to move onto another app because it wasn't worth the headache.",
            "I just wanted something to help me keep track of my food. IT HAS TOTALLY BLOWN ME AWAY! It has a very thorough questionnaire when you first sign up, then it tells you exactly what you need to eat to reach your goals. I can log my meals SO easily, log my workouts, my weight, my blood ketone readings, EVERYTHING. Every morning it gives me a little score indicating how well I did the day before, and on Mondays I get a weekly report card. And if I have a question, their support team is FANTASTIC!",
            "Love the app! BUT one thing I see as a major flaw is not being able to reset your account to start fresh. I was doing Keto last year and used the app regularly but then got off track for a bit and now starting back again. The trends are wonderful and I love having a visual of my progress but because it shows my initial start date, it is a huge hit to my self confidence when the app keeps showing me how much weight I gained over that time making it harder to focus on the progress I'm making now."

            "Very handy app. I use it everyday to track calories and nutrients. Would really, really like to see the option to use NET CARBS as the daily total carbs. That would be very useful to me. Love, love, love the bar-code scanning feature. I think some sort of organizational options for MY FOODS would also be helpful (folders? groups? sorting?) Scrolling through an unordered list of many items is pretty laborious. Overall, it's a very valuable tool to me.",
            "I started using this app on mid March and by mid October, I had lost a total of 13 pounds. It calculates the amount of calories you should consume based on your weight and height. It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",
            "Love this app! Tracks food, water intake, fitness and so much more. But my favorite feature is that you can scan most products and it will input for you. You can adjust amounts, if necessary. It has a community and other nice features. I am now asking myself why was I paying for a program (starts with a \"n\"). A youtuber (Kimberly Hooks) recommended it to me so now I am recommending it as well.",
            "I've used this app on and off, logging calories or just tracking food. I love it personally because the design is simple and aesthetically pleasing, adding your own foods and nutrition info is easy, and the bar code scanner is convenient for packaged foods.",
            "The only thing I would change is the ability to add foods not in the library with info that I have. Example Dreamfield Pastas I appreciate the correction. Found it, tried it, loved it. Really helping me. It was suggested by my doctor."

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

            "Doesn't work at all anymore, it was great till I updates it today. Its not worked since the update, it launches, but after that I just get constant errors.

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

            "I love this app. My daughter is 3 years old, immunocompromised, and is about to have her second open-heart surgery next week. This app has allowed us to track her fevers during recent illnesses and to also keep track of symptoms at the time of the temperature. When we meet or speak to the pediatrician or specialists, I have a log of all of her temperatures and symptoms. It's extremely helpful. Love this product and the app! Highly recommend Kinsa!",
            "The app and help page are well designed. Plus 1 star! However because of the price and issue I have I would avoid buying the thermometer if possible. CVS had few options, due to covid. I felt the thermometer should come with a spare battery. Worked when I first got it. Worked a 2nd time. 2 months later I try to use again. But now I only get an \"Err\" Kinsa's help page describing clearly how to remove the battery, if the Err message persists, they recommend replacing the battery (CR 2032).",
            "I'm very unhappy that this product required me to download and login to the app when the instructions indicated the device could be used \"by itself or paired to the Kinsa app\". When I initially turned it on all I could get was \"app\" which I thought meant the battery was low. But with a new battery I got the same thing \"app\". So I had no choice other than returning to Target or downloading the app and I needed to take my temp today. Our prior thermometer died.",
            "Great you can track you temperature as you take it. Only thing that i will say is you must have Bluetooth on before the thermometer will allow you to get the 3 dash to take temperature! But if Bluetooth is on and thermometer is not turning on, you must hold close to Bluetooth device to recognize it. But overall, I got it working properly and I love it! Even if you or family is sick from the flu or other sickness, that has a temperature that happens with the sickness! GREAT DEVICE!",
            "Horrible. Won't work without downloading the App. Wants your bluetooth on and location services on and know where you are. I'll be returning this piece of garbage tomorrow. I want to use it without App. Won't work without it. Instructions say it will but doesn't. Total piece of garbage"

            "Could be a great little thing, especially for TCOYF users, but I've really lost my patience with it - I've never before encountered such a technically unstable, buggy app. Apart from the fact that it feels quite dated, it also constantly runs into problems - i.e. unable to connect to the server, no matter what you do. This means no access to previous cycles, no possibility to enter new data. Essentially, one year of tracking is gone out of the window. Very, very disappointing.",
            "This was the best app out of 4 that I have tried. I say WAS because all of a sudden it's stopped working & telling me \"login failed\". I've religiously used the app for almost a year. I've uninstalled & reinstalled the app several times today & no change. There isn't even an option to logout so I can try to login again. Your app holds tons of very important information for those of us having difficulty w/ getting pregnant & it's nerve wracking for it to not work. Will change to 5 stars when fixed",
            "The most frustrating app I've used for tracking cycles. The accompanying device does not sync thru Bluetooth sensors even though it has an option. You can't go back and edit dates and data throughout the cycle.The app doesn't let you view previous cycles to edit just the completed chart. I ended a cycle thinking that my period was starting and I can't go back to fix it. Honestly I wish it would be updated to 2020 standards. If I I have to send an email to understand the app, its not clear enough",
            "Started using this month every day on my Android phone, but tht last 2 days it just keeps saying log in failed. I've rebooted my phone, checked for updates, and it still isn't working. All my data for this month are not accessible now 😭",
            "My first fam track app was OVY( simultaneously using it to the ovagraph). I like that the app is very detailed and you can add a lot of different points. It's also very customised. Unfortunately the user interface is very glitchy. I get logged out even if I'm online. Everytime I want to read a thread and go back afterwards I end up on the home screen instead of the community. Also it seems to be all about TTC and there is nothing about birth control. 🤔 Maybe the online version is better."

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."
