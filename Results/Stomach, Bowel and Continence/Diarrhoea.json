        "description": "Diarrhoea is a leading cause of illness and death among children in developing countries, where an estimated 1.3 thousand million episodes and 4 million deaths occur each year in under-fives. Worldwide, these children experience an average of 3.3 episodes each year, but in some areas the average exceeds nine episodes each year. Where episodes are frequent, young children may spend more than 15% of their days with diarrhoea (Figure 1.1). About 80% of deaths due to diarrhoea occur in the first two years of life. The main cause of death from acute diarrhoea is dehydration, which results from the loss of fluid and electrolytes in diarrhoeal stools. Other important causes of death are dysentery and undernutrition.\r\nDiarrhoea is an important cause of undernutrition. This is because patients eat less during diarrhoea and their ability to absorb nutrients is reduced; moreover, nutrient requirements are increased as a result of infection. Each episode of diarrhoea contributes to undernutrition; when episodes are prolonged, their impact on growth is increased.",

            "Okay, so I really like this app. It nees work, but it is better than other choises. At least I can make a password lick for my account so nobody can look through. One problem I had was the color change. I was changing the cover color to blue, and It didn't work although it said it was sugsessful. That was the only bug, It didn't even effect me, so this app is good.",
            "This app is incredible and secure plus if you have a password for your phone than it will be double security. And there is no loosing the lock its in your brain. And you can change the background, the font style and the font color. If you forget your password and you are signed in then they will send you the code. Pretty sweet so i recommend this to anyone who needs a dairy. 😇😍",
            "I like the app, it's really good. The only issue I have is the ad banner that tends to appear most of the way up the screen leaving grey. It's a pain to remove. Also, an idea for you... changing the layout of entried or notes. So you can choose for them to stay as they are, be in reverse order or a calendar layout. 👍",
            "This app is amazing, I love the way it is set up! Its always there to listen even though the stories might be boring, its always there to help you get things off your chest. Without this app I would still have stuff to think about and nowhere to go to talk things through. The only problem is that one time it did not save my progress but it was mainly my fault.",
            "Really good. Recommended. It tells you the date automatically and you can changes colour of text and theme by yourself with no charge. You can even change the colour of the app icon if you don't like pink colours. Many much more feature need to check it out yourself. It's free with ads so don't be afraid to try it out yourself."

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

But one tiny thing is i think you should update it so after your finished dairy is complete you can actually scroll down to see all of our published items fulling not to a certain point when veiwing your dairy! Otherwise i love this app 4 star rating from me! :)",

            "I love roses and I couldn't find a better decorated diary. The rose emogis are adorable and I enjoy the app. I wish it had games for earning your costomization items (backgrounds, rose emogis), but it's this daily lottery thing where you watch ads to speed up your wait time; not very fun. I also wish I could set a default text color, size, and font instead of set it every time. And the ad that pops up when you try to \"back\" out of the app is not fair (it won't go away, unlike others). Want pro v",
            "Is a very nice app dat everyone must used. It helps one keeps their secrets on their fones without any fear.",
            "1) It doesn't lock once we set the pin. I go out, come back in to find it opens on the last page I was in. 2) It is not like the pics show where your text comes onto a heart, or a cute ruffles page turned sideways. It is just lined up in plain format in a row. But it does offer roses thankfully. But how am I to lock it frm outsiders???",
            "I loved it,, it's an app that anybody can use and it have privacy too,,,, in short I love themes is to die for and what deserve the five star is how easy to use,,,, don't miss this,,, update it pls we need more new cards an moods please",
            "It is very nice app, but why do I giving a 3 star rating because of backup and restoration of data is not available. So please implement the feature of backup and restore soon. Thank you."

I will not give one star because it show lots of ads. And also it shows lots of ads for updating something. Overall the game is nice. I will tell people to download it. My personal review for this game is very nice.",

No matter you are a kid or an adult, everyone has a work. Some of them wish to have a to do list but they won't have it. You can write your to do list like when you should work or when you should go where. You can write them in this app. But I think this app needs a little development. I hope this app will be helpful for you. Thanks for readin'.",

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

You can use any background you choose, they have some available and you can upload your own, but with only black ink, only light colored backgrounds will work. Unless I am missing that option already on there, though I doubt it cause I have looked already."

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause.",

I think the color is hideous and would prefer the option to change it but since thats the worst thing I can say about it, I consider it an excellent app.",
            "It is a nice app to write dairy with a lock. But when I was clicking on fingerprint icon it was not starting and there should be an option to change backgrounds colour and writing style. Emojis should be there in sentences too because if there is little happines we cant put that emoji in sentence. Otherwise it is nice to write dairy :-).",
            "This app is amazing i can write my feeling when i need to and express how i feel when i want to if you are looking for a app for a diary defeantly choose this one. It helped me alot, at first it asks you for a password you get to choose it then it shows you a tuturial How to use it and at the end after you write how you feel you have to select a Emoji. Lastly if you press on the three lunes it will say edit profile press on it the press on the pencil and you can pick your own profile. Thxs. Xxx",
            "It's pretty cool but I wish we can choose wether we can do finger print or padlock so it would be easier and hope we can change the background of the diary entry's were all diary are kept so yes .so out of that it's great.☺"

            "I highly recommend this journal whether you're a professional or a personal journaler. It has quite a few features & can back up to Google drive or use off line as I do. Its the only one that offers different folders or categories for different entries. I also like that I have the option to keep it simple without emojis or other childish bloat. I only have the free version but that gives me more than enough to keep an attractive, stylish, private & easy to navigate journal.",
            "This app came up on a paint app i was enjoying and i just wish id found it in June! I LOVE this app i have loved how interactive it is. I have a learning disability that I struggle with all the time, the ability to use color and seperate into catagories is wonderful. Also Im struggling with an eye issue, with this app I can add the photo, have the weather and location AND print it seperate!! This is wonderful. Soon im getting the upgrade. Only negitive is the printed page the photo is to big.",
            "I love this app. It's fairly easy to use and was intuitive to me. I like being able to put moods, tags, categories, etc. on the entries. I wish it was available as a PC app as well! Then I would love to write on the computer and sync up to the app on my phone.",
            "Free version not a lot of use. I wanted it for medical diary for my doctor, unable to print and can not find exported entries.",
            "I've been trying out lots of different options for keeping some kind of journal. I couldn't put my finger on what I needed but none of the other apps seemed to tick the box. This one is as close as possible to what I was looking for. This app is for sure one of the most updated, well maintained and thought out journaling/diary apps in the store. Navigation is plain and simple, as it should be. Only been using this app for three days so far but I really like it."

            "Well this app is better than the others. Other apps are complex and too girly. So, this one is good.. Also, there is a lock system WHERE if a person tries to open your Diary and fails for 2 times (you can choose the number of times), then it captures the culprit's face... This is the best feature... Only problem: We can't insert any pictures in our diary... Please try to fix this... then it will be better if I could insert images of my experience of the day.",
            "Indeed, here is a well developed Diary with lock. Hoping that it is secured and would not open to unauthorized users through back-door by the use of powerful devices/apps. How I wished it was made simpler than this to accomodate those who would feel bored by the initial details of operating it. I like to suggest, though, that as an innovation, provision should be made for those of us who might want to keep certain information or document in a lock up diary like this for retrieval in future.",
            "Ease of use, Simple interface are the main benifites and plus functionalities I experienced so far in this app. It doesn't satisfy all the needs you want. Such like change the font size and style while typing, add additional notes, time periods. Otherwise the app is good for use.",
            "This app is very nice. But i found some problems something like 'the fingerprint operation canceled' or 'the can not read out in hindi language'. So solve the problems. And i give some advice for make better this app that is you should give one another option for add some memorable pics in the text. Thank u so much. I hope u will make better this app very soon."

            "It is the best app ever, I love this, its been days, but i am still using it, Its actually the best. The lock works perfect, but it would be great to add more fonts..I don't care about fonts so it is of course the best in my eyes!! Thank you (^o^)",
            "This is a super great diary app. I love that the app itself has a pass code. I love that you can tag your entries. Everything is just so clean and organized. This app should come as a default on phones, its that good. I wish there were more color options- like tagging each entry with a choice of color. I wish when I tagged my entries there was a list of recently/commonly used ones so I didn't have to remember how I tagged things before. I'm not sure if there's a search by tag option anyways?",
            "This is a good diary app. It is feature rich. The only problem is, it doesn't allow different fonts to print. You need to allow the font in the app to be printed in at least PDF format. I've used the app for the last 3 weeks, no real problems. The ads don't try to overtake your device. The app is very useful. May I suggest go ad free. It's that good of an app., and the price is right.👍👍",
            "Amazing!!! I have installed too many other diary apps in my tab, but it was only waste of time and space in my tab. But while I was putting an end in searching, I just thought to search for only one other app, and that App was this!! It's literally amazing and we can even change it in pdf format. I just love this diary. I recommend you guys to try this app too!!",
            "love it so far. just a plain diary with all the features i need, without unnecessary ones. the UI is clean and smooth and the price for ads removal is surprisingly low, i really appreciate it. but could you pleeease add extended fonts with special symbols support (umlauts, cyrillic letters)? it would make the journaling experience a 100 times better. thanks. i wish the developers the best of luck."

I love how you can change the fonts and backgrounds and stuff! It's so convenient! The only problem I have is that it has many ads and is really annoying!

            "Just starting to use the app and it works perfectly for me. Simple and easy to use. Just a comment: Can add an option to sort the diary entries? Sometimes I want to view it by the diary date, the created date, or title; depending on my use. Tried to do so just now but cannot find a way. Would be really useful if the feature is available.",
            "Such a cool app, but the problem is that I don't want to pay to be able to use certain things. I get it, that's how you make money and whatnot but still, I just want to write the entries like I would write them on a piece of paper. With everything available. Still the app is really cool and I love it.",
            "The app's pretty good, it has different themes, different emotes on each entry, and way, way, more. I'm not gonna complain that it isn't free (not all features are there cause I didn't pay for premium) cause I understand that companies have to find a way to make money. I really recommend this app for anyone who likes journaling or just wants to try it out!",
            "First of all, I would like to thank you so much for the existence of this journaling app! I have tried other apps in the past and I'm glad I have finally found this one! The themes are simplistic, beautiful and calming. And I really adore the quality of the stickers, it gives such an aesthetic touch to the diary entries. May I suggest a Web version for the diary? I appreciate the Google sync feature, but a Web version would do wonders. I can't write on the computer because I can't install the app and sync. If there's a Web version, surely I'll be able to write on the computer just as I would on my phone or tablet. And I would really love if you add more free stickers, I love them so much. So far, I'm giving it 5 stars. No ads or constant pop-ups to buy the premium. It's all very relaxing and appropriate for journaling. Keep it up!",
            "Everything about this app is AWESOME! I have to found any problems. I love how if you forgot your password you can type questions! Oh wait.. here's my actual problem.... Nothing! Also I'm so glad that there are no ads!"

This change would make the program a complete app and give us the functions that we crave in an app like this.... I hope those changes will come",
            "Sync problems reduced my stars to one, but developers were quick to respond, and I was able to sync all my data properly. Thank you so much!!",

            "Really Nice... and Cool Features... but for a Price I was excited to start using this app. There have been many times where I get ideas for art projects, and experience feelings that can only be described in the given moment. It's easy to add entries and do quick check-ins multiple times a day and I was psyched to see the other journaling ideas... Until I saw that you have to spend $30/year for those features. So cruel to ad them just to say, \"Pay us! Minus that, I would give it 5 stars.",
            "The app has more intelligent offer than I expected. First, it is a great interface to use on any devices, web, phone, tablet so I'm happy to be able to access it any time. The note is simply minimal and well organized. I'm surprised that there are actually promt checkins and guided templates for different topics for journaling. I'm using more than I intended.",
            "So far so good very simple to use and the design and layout is appealing. Better than most I've tried recently. Option to upload multiple photos in one go rather than individually would be handy, and the ability to upload videos would be nice. Great experience so far though.",
            "it is a really good app, ive only just started using it and is very good compared to other diarys and mood journals ive had in the past. it is good even without the subscription as you have access to the diary feature, mood board and everything. the only reason im giving 4 stars is because i feel that the mood board could be a bit more in depth that just, \"pick a face, what activities made you feel this way, any other notes.\" i feel it needs a little more but it is a great app and i recomend it!",
            "Pay to use... Listen, If you guy offer this for free with a very LIGHT ad presence so you can get paid for the work out into creating this app, fine. If you want to offer the option to pay like 1 or 2 dollars to get rid of the ads, fine. Even if you roll out new amazing content, I mean serious content that you can't find elsewhere, not fonts, themes, backgrounds, photo insertion or that simple bs. But telling me to pay over $5 monthly when I can buy a $1 notebook? No, that is money grubbing."

            "The app used to be good but recently i forgot my password and the question to reset your password soesnt work. It changed itself. Now its asking \" when was your first enemy born \" how on earth am i supposed to know that 😑😡😠😤",
            "Some really weird glitch happened. Went on the app and there must have been an update of some sort, but everything was wiped from my previous entries and I had to redownload the app. Very odd. WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT GET THIS APP. I LOST THREE MONTHS OF ENTRIES ON THIS BECAUSE OF AN UPDATE. DO NOT GET THIS",

Today the website seems to not be loading tags or folders, but hoping that's a temporary issue! Edit: all working now, thanks!",
            "I've been trying many journaling and diary apps in search of one that suits my needs. Being able to create different color coded sections with tags, entry dates, weather, and even a map of where I wrote the entry was really cool. It took me a little while to get used to it, but I did and I really like it. I need to keep track of many different things, and Diaro has been working the best for me. I love that Diaro backs up to Dropbox and synchs with all of my devices.",
            "I have been a user of this app since 2015. What makes this app better than its many competitors is its excellent customer service! If you send them an email with a concern, they are on top of it with a quick response with a fix or to inform you that their working on it expediently yet apologetically. Great group of support staff!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews, but this app is one of the exceptions. I really love writing and so I went to look for an app where I can pour all my ideas into. I found this app and I really loved it. The word count, folders, fonts and size adjustments are amazing. I find writing with this app really comfortable. Definitely would recommend.",
            "A great electronic diary. After hand writing a daily diary for 30 years I finally went electronic in 2018. I love this app. It's really easy to use and backs up to Dropbox efficiently every night. The ability to save your diary into a Word document is brilliant. Wish there was the facility on the app to get a year's diary printed into a book professionally. That's the only thing I'd add. Addendum: I've been using this for two years. I still love it. It's never failed me!"

All I typed is gone. Fix pls",

Why did I even purchase this app? I can no longer use this app for a long-term period without paying monthly. I love Universum, so it breaks my heart to say this, but... you guys just lost a customer. I'm sorry. Universum was good, but now, it just cheated me of my money and time.",

Thank you for the help ! May I add something since I use this app like how I drink water everyday. Such simple and useful app. This is my basic essential for everyday use. I don't remember a day I wasn't using it. For the FINANCE/income/budget, is there a way the developer can add another input like BUDGET? Thank you a ton !",

As far as I can tell, you can't export your data in a format that is importable. And yes, you can sync your data with a cloud service, but you need to pay for a monthly subscription if you want to include your pictures. And I HATE subscriptions for software. I'm perfectly willing to pay a one- time fee. But not periodically. So no.",

            "Love this, it's great for diary people. It's well organized and has lots of simple features. One thing I would fix is finding a way for unfinished work to be saved. Sometimes when I accidentally exit, I go back in and my long paragraph about my life story for that day is all gone and I have to start over- which is frustrating. So that the only I would fix. One thing i think should be added on- if u take my suggestion- is an audio feature. Maybe so you can record voice and keep it in the entry.",
            "I'm going to unfortunately have to quit use soon if this keeps up... In the middle of typing lately my keyboard will disappear, the all will flash and freeze while I type. Which is a shame because I've been using it for so long and it's only recently started doing this. :(",
            "I just started using it today. I love it! Easy to use, I can change themes, easy lock, I can journal, make lists, add photos, etc.. 8/6/20- One huge con. No back up! I didn't look for it, after I started using it. I have a lot of entries, with a lot written in each one. If something happens to my phone, it's all gone, because I can't back it up. 9/16- new phone, and will have to copy& paste a lot of stuff...",
            "It's pretty good. Simple. I like that.. Just wish you could personalize more. Don't like the color selection.. Too much pink and goldish yellow. Wish there was more calming colors or different pinks.",
            "The reason the 2 Star Is because I switched phones and all my inputs are non - transferable... Other than that I LOVE IT, easy to use, hopeful THEY will listen and try to figure it out"

        "description": "Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\r\n\r\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\r\n \r\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\r\n\r\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\r\n\r\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\r\n\r\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety.

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

This is going to be an excellent tool as I continue stydying.",

            "Great app. The instructions on backing up your Diary is a little confusing and unclear so, that's one improvement that can be made. Also, adding a 'Search function' to help find previous entries would be an idea to consider."

            "I love this app a lot! I use it daily and it really helps to write down my feelings. Especially when I just feel like when I can't tell anyone. And plus the the quotes are very motivational and true. I love it! The reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is a lot of stuff not worth paying for that much for the premium thing. And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",
            "I love this app. My favourite thing is that it gives you a routine based on your mood. Its great for if you feel a bit down too and you can see your progress in happiness. In July I had saved mine as \"stressed because of school\" and now I'm happier than ever! Defo recommend 5☆ from me!",
            "Reflectly is such a great app! You can add multiple moods and activities for each day, there are also quotes, you can choose what quote style you want for different things you are struggling with or things you just need to hear. I highly recommend this app!",
            "Really terrible experience. I applied for account.paid 1 months fee, completed stupid tutorial and before email creation hit back. Because I don't want to create this account. And now I'm stuck on trial account, but I lost 1 months fee. I'm totally disappointed. Stupid tutorial, stupid app, stupid idea! Return my money!!!",
            "I know this app is good because my friend showed me it and after time he was feeling great thanks to this so i wanted to try too, but before i could create my account it didnt let me tick the TERMS OF PRIVACY box and i wish that you could fix it please. But otherwise this app is great according to my friend."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",

On restore it found a backup but when loaded it appeared to be someone else's! It certainly wasn't my data. Im very annoyed as I've never used a diary before so for me to start one at my age was a big step. I can only recommend NOT to use this app. response, I know I'm not stupid, it was set via your app but the backup found wasn't mine!",

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

            "I payed for a month just to try it out fully. It's a very pleasing app to use, the ui looks very elegant and it actually feels like Chiku is asking me questions rather than me just ranting onto the paper. The o ly complaints I have are that it's going to be a massive pain to scroll to old stories and I feel as though the daily reads (for me) aren't too useful. Really great app! I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",
            "Very nice app. It's more than an app. It's a safe space🌌. Meditation is very nice. The quotes are very good of course!! Im in love with this app. The themes are all so good. Writing here is so easy!! Love it.",
            "Easiest app to use. It is enough options to declare all your feelings and mood conditions, also, if you want you can add a written description about what's going on.",
            "This app is amazing. I love how it reminds you to add a new story every day. Idk how to explain but everything is perfect.",
            "I'd like to visit my previous entries with more ease. Please let me view them more easily without having to scroll sideways a lot. Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries."

            "I just rated this a few days ago. Idk why they asked me to rate it again. Anyways, I like the convenience, Iike how straightforward and uncomplicated the app is. Also like the pink theme (love pink) and the fact that theres a pin code so that only YOU can read your secrets! Only thing I kinda hate is the fact that you have to save your note yourself. It doesn't automatically save it for you. Hope ya remember to save it or it will get deleted. Other than that, it's pretty good.",
            "Love this app because of it's total simplicity and lack of intrusive ads. Easy to navigate, easy to add new entries and to go back if you've skipped a day. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of other apps, but I find this makes it quicker and easier to keep it up-to-date. Definitely going to get the pro version just for the emojis!",
            "The only problem I encounter every time I try to restore my backed-up data is that it shows no dialogue that the restoration process is finished. I just estimate the time required to restore, and then when I go back, it's all there, perfectly restored. The problem is that it doesn't show the progress of the restoration, nor does it show the end screen that the restoration is completed. (The restoration itself works fine though.)",
            "So far so good. Wish it had more themes and emojis. I know when you purchase more is offer but even that is a limited variety. Also wish I could do my pages different colors so I can categorize my journal. All in all good app thanks guys🤗 Sorry one more thing. How do I go in setting and change the tone format?",
            "It is easy I write in this app. Seven months into lockdown, I have just started writing, and since I anticipate it will be at least a year before there is an effective, safe vaccine, I am glad I found this as a way to record my thoughts. The biggest negative aspect of the lockdown is the dire restriction on social connections with other people, and I am concerned about of such continuous isolation."

            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

I wish this app would auto save your work so if you close the app you can continue later. I lost so much work 😓 cuz I'm a dummie and closed the tab...",

A floating widget were i can press a button to see my memos, a button to hit for making diaries, and another for tasks and entries. Please add an awesome widget to expand this awesome app. Then ill re rate 5 stars",

I've have used a few other notepads and journal apps but they all seemed to have something missing... and then I found this Gem! Or maybe it found me so-to-speak... Ive always been attracted to the Darker Side of things, and it always intrigues me to dive a little deeper... And now i have one more item to add to the collection, it has a great look and easy to use and navigate thru and the dark Theme makes it even SEXIER!!",
            "I saw a lot of BUG, 1. bug when updating a photo in note, photo didn't update and make app stuck for some times 2. Please add feature undo and redo like Ms word Because I lost my special note and dont know why, and im so disappointed i need to do analysis again to make that note. For now just that, over all its good, the bad i found for now just what im write. Thanks for your service and respond. Alex",

            "In response to Plop😀 Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. 🙂",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

The scroll UI to change time is horribly sensitive. Poops and notes are separate entries, not together.

            "I like that it's minimalistic. It has different pastel colors that suits a diary. I could choose this over any app out there but the problem here is the backup and restore. Whenever I want to backup my files in Drive, I don't see any. Plus the export file isn't working, too. It has \"title.\", \"highlights\" \"tone\" and everything else in it. This is a good app but not for backups or exports.",
            "Minimalistic and simple interface. Very much enjoy the clean layout of the diary entries. Because of the simplistic design, I use this diary for multiple things: health tracker, journal entry, notes. I also appreciate the ability to back-up data to the Google Drive. Photos can be viewed easily after inserting into a journal entry, will look forward to using this as a travel diary too!",
            "The design is perfect! It's light and simple, help get you focused more on your thought. However, it wasn't designed to show last month notes, you have to go back and search for it. It would be greater if the app don't separate the monthly notes so throughly, a thin line to separate months would have been good enough 😊",
            "I am in awe of the clean interface of Daisy. The simplicity of this app is wonderful and has inspired me to write more than I usually do. It's perfect for digital pocket journalling because the design is straightforward. In the future, if the interface and features change, I hope it would be better than the present, however, I don't mind if it stays like this forever. Also the pro upgrade is affordable and worth the money! Thank you developer(s)!",
            "I once heard someone say that if you feel you are oversharing, get a journal. This app has been a perfect companion on days when I want to get things off my chest but don't necessarily want to speak to anyone. The interface is clean and simple yet satisfactory to the aesthet in me. 10/10 would recommend."

Would be 5 stars, but every time I try to type in a pass code it says the 2 don't match and won't apply a pass code lock. I also can't figure out if there's a way to change the look of the highlight tags? I typed one in lowercase and the rest upper and it sticks out like a sore thumb",
            "That's a great looking app.👌👍 Butt... It could be more better (i think best) if you could add this two important fearures in your app-- 1. Password protection in free version as most of the other diary apps have. 2. Backup plan (email addition) to make the entries forever. This is the key feature of a diary without this, it's like I am writing on a rough paper😐. That's all i hope from you😊",
            "A great app overall, but I don't wanna pay to have a lock on my diary. I'm a child and I dont really feel comfortable trusting my parents, so I want a lock. I have no money to buy it with so I dont know what to do. I want to keep my personal stuff to myself. Kids should had some privacy. Could you maybe maybe make it free to use for people who need to keep their personal things to themselves, like me?",

            "To be honest in the past, I really love this app, But this days I can't say that anymore because this app autosave setting is very very bad. Example when you try to edit a bunch of paragraphs and when you scroll downward it is very very slow plus when you accidentally hit the select in the reason you don't know , then accidentally hit a letter, the whole bunch of your precious words are gone like that. And you can't even hit \"don't save\" because it doesn't have one.",

I know that the monthly subscription isn't much BUT with everything going on currently, due to these \"COOTIES-19\", I might be able to subscribe. But during this time I NEED every single penny that I have/get. But again, I love this app, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good journaling app!! 💯",

            "Gorgeous APP 🤗, I think it has a well-selected set of features (sign of a thoughtful designer), and it meets my needs... it undeniably has an intuitive layout that triggers motivation. Love the concept! The secret is keeping it as simple as possible... I would give this a double 5 ⭐ if I could! Bought it and truly, no regrets 👍🤗😀",
            "One of those apps that exactly fits what you are looking for. It has the amazing user experience, simple to create memories and easy to navigate dates or memories, easy search overall I loved it. Cost of pro is exorbitant, but I am sure they deserve what they claim. I wish at least sync was free, as storage is from google drive.",

Spreadsheets aren't that easy to manage on phone screens. But this app is completely customisable, even to creating one's own entries as user definable units. I've been tracking my food for years, and this app has just made it so much quicker and easier! To the creator, thanks so much, dude. Brilliant job, and I've just bought the full-featured version. 👍",

No need to make a profile, search for brands (or at all), and has options to include any macro and how you want to display them next to the name or not. it shows remaining or total. With a toggle. It's basically perfect and I plan to buy the premium version for the dark theme."

If it were up to me to get anything added to the app it would be the ability to edit the time I eat my meals. Right now it logs the meal and assigns the time I made the entry as the time I ate. I usually add my meals at the end of the day so for tracking purposes it ends up looking like I ate all my meals at seven in the evening.",
            "Great App. I do like the selection of options in the app (notes, goals, monthly planner, etc). It's definitely more suiting for female users. So far, it's the best app of its kind I've found, that meets most of my needs. The only thing I would change is adding more options (fonts, colors, etc). I'll continue to use this app until something better comes along. Thanks for creating such a convenient app!",
            "This is a beautiful gem❤, everything I need in one place. Love that I'm able to change themes this keeps it fresh for me. Would love to see a check off for goals or task And a habit tracker would be a lovely addition. For expenses, to be able to name the accounts and add and deduct from each account would be nice. Maybe add tags and location for entries. But other than that, loving adding pics and the many awesome packed features. This is the best diary, planner ,tracker👏❤❤",
            "Decided to download this app to try and be more positive, I quite like it and have been using it everyday... my reason for the 4 stars is because I feel like there should be more feelings to pick from and the \"my money\" section doesn't work properly... for example it only types £15 you can't put £15.50 because you can't use the full stop which means its not an accurate balance. Overall good app would recommend 😊",
            "The app is quite handy and easy to find, since I don't have to go through a pile of books to locate it. I like the quotes sent in daily. My reason for the four stars is: I'm yet to maximize it's use though, and I just updated the app so I will need to use it for sometime to know if there are things to work on."

            "This the greatest academic app I've ever had. You can even listen to an AI reading your notes. However, may I suggest that the Italicize, Boldface, Underline, and Highlight be used to typewritten words. For example, I want to highlight a sentence. Instead of retyping it, can you make it possible not to retype and just highlight the chosen text. Thank you 😊",
            "Actually i like this app , but the problem is that there are a lot of ads, I am ultimately irritated by this, where ever u type, you could not see where or what ur typing, just an AD in a rectangular shape, and there is no cancel option, u cannot remove the ad, it is so irritating, I downloaded this app so that I can write something but I think this app is for irritating everyone by ads.... And another concern is that u cannot add pics... Do not download I motivate other apps",
            "This is really great. I like how it is organized, the beautiful fonts, I like everything about it; but may I suggest something please? I was thinking maybe you can make more pretty covers for the notebooks, not only the plain colors and maybe change the theme/design into something really appealing and pleasant to the eye. The overall appearance and design of the app is really important and essential, you know. Thank you so much, creators! I hope you see this review! Keep on improving ♥️",
            "I liked the idea a lot except that there are very annoying ads (having ads at all is annoying, but these particular ads are atrocious). There is no undo button, and it always saves immediately after you edit something (including when you accidentally delete an entire paragraph). And lastly, unless I'm somehow just not figuring this out, you cannot embed an image into your text. You can \"add attachments,\" but it only puts them in a random order you can view by clicking a button at the top right.",
            "Just started using it, but this this seems like a great app for writing notes for school and books and stuff. The only thing that confused me at first is the fact that the sketches and attached images don't go on the page itself. They go into a little paperclip button on the top right corner. The sketch feature could also benefit with zoom and undo/ redo features. I would highly recommend!"

Verification 4 backups can't b verified..says that it can't even sign in but doesn't let me try -- period. I'm going 2 check my email in a 2nd & see if I need 2 verify there 1st. You might want 2 inform people if that is in fact the case. Cuz I didn't C anywhere saying otherwise. Font, color, background & mood changes R awesome. I don't get the lottery/locked up moods etc. Why? Did read privacy tho.",

Why is this happening? It seems random. Can anyone explain why this is happening. Duplicate photos only appearing on my phone, the computer version is always perfect.",
            "I was more of a pen and paper type, which I still do on occasion but I love the fact I can ad photos and that will autoadjust the location of my entry to match the photo so I can show and speak to the moment. I can also journal on my driving commute which is always where I'm unloading the days thoughts and feel inspired. It's so easy and will always be able to be found.",
            "I tried to export the journal to a new email account; exportation is only supported with a premium account. So I signed up for a 7-day trial with auto-renewal in order to export my journal... but was unable to import the journal into the new email account. Now frustrated, I tried to turn off the auto-renewal so I wouldn't be charged for a functionality that didn't work. No dice. The link provided in the help desk was 404-ed, the link provided in the desktop app didn't work. In short, fraudulent.",
            "I love this app. So nice that I can add pics, audios, videos, links to my entries. It's so personal and meaningful. I wish it hadn't deleted some of my videos though. They were working and now it shows the entry is empty. Overall, best app I've found.",
            "At first I loved the app and made entries daily. Then all of sudden a question pops up in my head, \"what if the developers reads these daily enteries\". I never felt right since. I purchased the membership but I dont feel I have 100% privacy."

            "Would be great if the app gave the option to track the time along with the date of the symptom. The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",
            "The app is quite good but you need to add more functions and more details, add stuff that would keep your customers motivated to use it. E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",
            "Quite impressed but the calendar could do with improvement, need to be able to set a time for items and have a repeat options. But all in all it seems pretty good.",
            "Weird unintuitive interface, doesn't allow you to select more than 1 item e.g. when I add activity it deselect mood and it won't generate a list of items you've selected. Doesn't make any sense.",
            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

            "I really loved using this app. It replaced so many other apps for me and I have been using it almost every day. However, since the latest updates a few days ago, the app keeps crashing on startup and I am unable to use it at all. Please fix this as I would really like to continue using it. UPDATE: I believe the bug has now been fixed, thank you! Will update again if there are any more issues.",
            "I really like this app! Most of all: the fact that the devs are open to suggestions and bug fixes. I've asked for a few features that could be useful to improve my (and possibly other's) UI/UX and they've promptly and gracefully added the changes to the new update. I find that invaluable when using an app that someone else developed. Thanks for that! I only use a subset of the features available on the app so I can't give a thorough review of everything available. So far, I've had an excellent experience with the features that I've used. The only issue for me (but I totally understand) is the fact the dark theme is only available on the premium/pro version. I find that invaluable in any app but I understand that they need to make their money from somewhere. I will probably be recommending this app to anyone needing to log any form of data in a structured format. It allows to avoid needless repetition and provides useful UI/UX components to speed up the process.",
            "Thank you for the app. Lots of options! I'm looking into using this more as a log/tracker than primarily as a journal. Would raise the rating if these issues are resolved: 1) Is there a way to manually move individual Forms up and down the list after being created? Same with Fields inside the forms? Seems basic given the level of customization allowed. 2) Is there a way to hide the \"Recent\" forms? It's distracting. I prefer to manually move my most used form on the top of the list.",
            "This is the app I've spent my entire life searching for! I've owned and downloaded countless journals, planners and trackers, but this is the only thing that helps me organize my scattered mind and life all in one place! I've had it less than a week, but I've already created dozens of personal forms and more entries than ever before in one neat little place. I voiced concerns/suggestions and recieved prompt and professional responses, making me happy to pay the creators for this incredible tool!",

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "Great app. People who don't remember things or forget frequently should download this app. I use it to keep notes of everyday work things. Otherwise it will be difficult to remember many things mentally. But if you keep notes of it, it will become easy. You can keep countless notes in this app. You can give a title to each note and you can also type in the search bar to find a particular note. You can also change the background colour of each note and save it. I loved this app a lot.",
            "Its an okay app, most like the Easy Notes app I had on my old phone. Although in the older version, when a task was done, you could click on it and it would put a line thru it and move it to the bottom of the list. At that time, you could choose to delete completed tasks. I miss that because now I have to go line by line and delete wash item, kind of a pain. Just my thoughts",
            "O. Listen up I've been using this program from my notes for a number of years now. Today I've downloaded it into my newest phone. It's very easy quick and not complicated to operate; that's its best feature, in my opinion, I love it and wouldn't change. Give your note a title, space down begin to type or talk.... Then it's all done, hit save, go on about your business",
            "Nice app. It maintains serial .We can take out notes serially and by name also.It has kept the unfailure rules. It gives two (2) facilities.one is to keep the notes serially and to get out the notes serially. The other is to keep the notes by name and to get out the notes by name. Doctors ,Businessmen can use this app.",
            "omg! so easy to use, and you can go back & add things or remove multiple notes. I know you may be thinking, yeah so, but trust me I've had other note apps that were so difficult to add something or update it, that it felt like you were getting interrogated all for the want of adding something extra. I know that sounds dramatic, but with 5 kids now a single mum two jobs, I don't have time to be interrogated, I just want easy user friendly access to my notes and lists, and with this app I do. 😁😁"

Because it's easier for me to remember the picture than words. If you kindly can add it, I would be very grateful. Thanks. (PS I will recommend this app to my husband)",
            "This is a wonderful app. I used Day One for years but prefer this one now for its cross-platform capabilities. Syncing my journal between phone, laptop, desktop, and chromebook, so I can write whenever and wherever the mood strikes--is powerful. Improvements in the app make it better and easier to use, too. It wouldn't work on my Chromebook at first, for example, but works like a charm now. If you're looking for a powerful journaling app, look no further.",
            "What a great app! I recently was at a company-wide chat on mindfulliness. At that event, I saw the potential benefits of journalling more regularly than I have been. Diarium is a perfect app for it. Whether I am using my PC, my phone or, most likely, my Surface Duo and stylus, Diarium is a great and easy way to capture as much about the day - my thoughts, activities, music, surroundings - as I know. Highly recommended.",
            "I thought I was going to love it, until I started experiencing different issues. The second entery I made yesterday did not save & there is not a save box to select. I thought it would automatically save like the first one did, but I was wrong. And, I don't like that all I have listed on my calender on each day shows at the bottom where I text. It's a journal/diary, not a calender. I will not be keeping this app.",
            "What a great app. I think the addition of tags and all the other attachments really is a bonus. I like how it syncs up between my phone and my computer through cloud storage, and the sync button is right at the top. I wish it were a little easier to add a separate entry for the same day, but it's not super hard. Finding a date is easy, I like the calendar layout, it's easy to navigate. Maybe some font variations and colors might add to it, but overall it's a really good app so far."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

I don't need an app that syncs with anything else, shares with anyone, backs up anywhere, won't work without permission to talk to me and read my emails, listen to my phone calls, know my location etc., and interrupts me with adverts.

        "comments": [
            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

My pastor suggested thanking God daily in a deliberate, rather than my usual haphazard way, as a means of connecting with God less randomly. I found 'Presently' shortly after, and I make daily entries, reviewing them monthly. I have lots to be thankful for, and I am closer to God than before!",
            "I really enjoy this app. I've been using it for a while now and it's simple, easy to use, and streamlined. It has customisation options which are great if you prefer apps with a \"dark-mode\", its otherwise uncluttered design and interface provide a calming and reassuring feel. I like the daily reminders and that it has milestones for how many days you've tracked. It's a nice way to reflect on my day and focus on the positives. Presently rocks, so please never change! You're already perfect!",

Pithy quotes on gratitude, daily reminders & timely encouragements to develop the habit of gratitude. Pleasure to read & re-read past entries. Growing to be grateful for things past, thankful for the present and hopeful of the future - come what may, surely I can still find something to be thankful for. Simple app to build a lifelong, daily habit of gratitude. Highly recommended.",
            "I've been using this for about a week and am really enjoying it so far. The best things are that it has a simple but aesthetic design and the fact that there are no ads. And although you can write whatever you want, being asked what you're grateful for is a great start and helps me begin positively which I struggle with but think it's good to do for mental health. I hope these things never change because it makes it so calming and stress free to use compared to other journalling apps!",
            "Simple, easy to use, and convenient gratitude app. I love that it sends nightly reminders and there is nothing complicated about it. I look forward to getting my nightly reminders and I am now feeling so much more intuned to the things big and small I can show gratitude for daily. Love this so much!"

It would be nice to able to add images to more than just the main entry on a single day. I mean if you have more than one templet box on that day ... I'd like to decorate each with images. I love the unlimited books and the ability to change the main background. It would also be nice to maybe be able to change backgrounds for each journal book. Overall ...a great app!!!",

Love that you can use fingerprint to unlock access to the app. Other features I would like to see: - Daily motivational quotes. - Acces via web site. One of the best apps I have downloaded. Well done!",

It is really user friendly and works for just about everything I need. I was wondering if i missed a style or input for adding birthdays? The birthday section must appear daily but the names must repeat yearly???"

            "I have started to use the application in 2009. Then I liked it. In addition to this, I've decided to purchase for premium, created another account and shared my notebooks with my premium account. Then I couldn't see my shared notebooks on the web and mobile. I've been struggling with technical support for 2 weeks. They have promised for full technical support, I'm writing but they haven't returned for 5 days. Unfortunately, I'm switching back to Microsoft Onenote.",
            "After the major update to the app, the note texts are not readable anymore. Looks like Evernote messed up the text color setting in Android. My noted works fine in iPad and on PC. I always leave the text color as default and never changed it. However, in Android, text is in dark grey in Dark Mode, and light grey in Light mode. So the text color is always very close to the background color no matter which mode I choose. And this MAJOR issue has been there for at least a week!",
            "Ruined after the recent upgrade roll out: 1) Notes take ages to load up. 2) All the fonts which used to be available have now disappeared and all my notes are suddently in Sans Serif. At least it wasn't Comic Sans. 3) None of the desktop keyboard shortcuts I used to use which made this app efficient to use have disappeared. 4) It needs to be online to work - unnecessary and annoying Probably other things have gone wrong - it's only been a few hours since the upgrade. It wasn't broken - why try to fix it?? I've been a Premium subscriber for years - now considering cancelling & switching.",
            "I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation. The latest update is an utter disaster for me. It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have. I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device. Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits. This is useless! I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online. If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool. (NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)",
            "After the recent update, I've lost all my notes from the past 1 week simply because they had not automatically synced. The update was automatic btw. Pathetic experience, and quite stressful too. I was thinking of upgrading to premium but will definitely not do it now, after realizing my content can be deleted anytime without a fair warning."

I guess the only option I would suggest to the developer to add to this app would be to back up automatically to Google Drive. Great work!",

            "This is an amazing app! I use it every day!! My primary use for this app is reminders because my memory is so horrible. I have a reoccurring reminder to even set an alarm every night. For most of my reminders I need room for further notes or instructions, so this app works great for me. I make lists for various things and I really like that there's a feature that you can check things off on the list. It's satisfying to finish something, tap it, and its automatically crossed out.",
            "I LOVE color note!! I have used it for several, several years now, with multiple phones and it has transferred seamlessly to each one. I like it so much better than any other note app I've ever used. I still have a note saved on my app from 2011 when I went into labor with my daughter and I was timing contractions. This app is simple, user friendly, has convient options to use for shopping trips, work list, ect. This busy mom of 4 HIGHLY recommends!",
            "No way of backing up anything whatsoever unless you sign in with a Google account. In 5 years I've not had any issues with this app until now. Everything in the backup section has been disabled to force me to backup online with a Google account. The entire offline backup section no longer works, even signing up with an email address is broken and redirects to Google. I would've said these are bugs, but the offline backup section says 'sign in required' so I'm not so sure.",
            "This app is a must for maintaining notes, catalogues, & other items that require a checklist, without being bothered by pesky ads or such. It is overall fine, only thing is that it sets the very first of line of a note as the title of the note which is undesirable at times. Is there any option to do away with this? Recommended app.👍👍",
            "I've tried other notepad apps and this is my favorite. The color coding feature is extremely helpful, as is the fact that the notes are automatically saves as soon as I exit the program. Even better, my notes are synced across my devices so I never lose anything. This app does everything it's supposed to do, and does it well, without any obtrusive ads or annoyances. That, in my opinion, earns it five stars."

But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",

I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb.

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Used to be a really useful app. Since the update the app request a add-on to open my previous notes. Unfortunately the add-on installation keep crashing, rendering the my files impossible to access. UPDATE - Converting the old notes prevent the add-on installation to be triggered. This way you can keep using your old-converted notes as usual. This add-on is about, but it crash the app every time. Just convert your notes and forget about the whole add-on thing.",
            "The new update is terrible. I am losing my categories and coding. I miss the ability to save or discard. It's a phone so hitting keys by mistake is sooo common and I need that discard to undo. Also, when you paste pics into a note the text wrapping is completely uncontrollable. The pics move around into unrelated sections of the document. And why do I need pages in a digital notepad? And when pages get added but you delete what is on them the blank pages just stay there. It's an OCD nightmare.",
            "New update completely ruined the experience. I always bold out certain words and key terms in my notes to remember them, but now the bold button is 3 clicks away whereas it used to be right below my finger while I'm typing, moved to a now extremely inconvenient placement considering I'm bolding words every few seconds. Page breaks were completely unnecessary and ruin the structure of my notes, there should be an option to enable and disable them at my own will.",
            "I hate this new update, why do we have to convert our notes to this new version and why don't we have the flexibility of still using the old format to write our stuff? Some of us don't adjust well. I like some features that are in the new update though but let's have some flexibility at least. I use the app to write music and this has been very hard to do given the format that I've been accustomed to using. Please do something about this, thanks."

I absolutely love how clothes aren't based on gender as well as how cute they are, not to mention the excess of accessories as well as diversity in hair and skin tones/colors. This game will keep my interest for a long time, thank you for this creation!🖤",

Made an avatar for my bf and I, and we set it as our wallpaper <3 Simple to use (although a bit tricky when trying to line things up equally, a snap grid function would be awesome!) and cute add on packs. However, I'd love to see more color choices for clothing and accessories. Very frustrating trying to recreate people but lack a particular colour for the right item. Also, more male stuff pls! Overall, lovely app and a bit less chibi than the previous games like Lily Story.",

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",

            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

But when I was trying to upload a photo, it always force closed, and every time I pick report, it always comes to login page. I have tried to write today's diary more than 10 times. But all failed. Only once succeeded, that was when I forgot to insert the photo. And it cannot be edited! And the voice recorder is very bad.. too fast and unlistenable. So annoying! Uninstall.",

What i would need in order to give it 5 stars is: the ability to login with an account like google or facebook, save my backups automatically in google drive for example, and be able to pay in order to get rid of the ads.",

It crashes, every five minutes, and anything you touch, a loud, obnoxious add pops up. I'll never install this again, because oh lord is this app a bad one.",

            "This game is great, and I love to play it, but two things really get on my nerves, 1 definately more important than number 2. 1: Crashing. Every 5-8 minutes of playing the music will start to cut out (every single time it crashes) and then the game will close/crash. I have, so far, only seen 1 other review for crashes. 2: Slow pace. I don't like how slow the game progresses, it seems that it takes FOREVER to get the the next level, especially the more levels you climb, but that's just me.",
            "Edit: servers are undergoing maintenance, apparently. This is the first time this has happened for me without a notification popping up. Sigh. The game refuses to connect to the server despite me being on WiFi. It simply says \"unable to connect to server, check your connection\". I have checked, and my connection is fine. Please fix this. It's one thing to lose out on bonuses after activating boosters if I forget to log in, but another if I'm prevented from logging in altogether.",
            "Game crashes too easily nd issue is almost 50% reproducible. Suddenly, the application gets stuck and stops. Would like to have this fixed. Also, I have noticed sometimes, it gets blocked in a place for a few seconds probably 1 or 2 which always doesn't end up in an ANR but yes there is a big issue in this that the app crashes frequently",
            "This game is great i used to play it a while back and i recently started to get back into it, one main issue thats REALLY ticking me off is the nonstop crashing of the game. I don't remember this being this bad and as i read through the comments on the reports I'm not the only one please do your best to fix this issue",
            "This is a great game, I love supercell but there is a problem for the S9. ( well it happens to me) So I will be playing the game and collecting my crops, then I will put stuff on sale, then I would start to create things. But no matter what I do the game crashes every single time I play it, I know it's not my phone with supercell games because I have clash of clans and it doesn't crash at all. It's only hay day that crashes so supercell please fix this and I will give you a five star review!"

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

BMI, Body Fat % and Ideal Weight calculations within the app are estimations based on your inputted data and are based on commonly used scientific formulas (described in the app).

            "So far so good! Update 8/27/2020: the app used to work GREAT, but been having problems with it recently. I recorded a video journal entry, it doesn't show it. Tried backing everything up to Google Drive, doesn't work anymore, the app freezes up. Sent an email to the developer, never got any response back. It's a shame too because it was doing good, then no more. Thinking about just uninstalling..",
            "It's a good app, it helped me feel very secure with my thoughts I just wish there were more emojis to really Express how you feel at a particular time, and I don't know why it's not possible to read from a previous entry, you can't scroll down to read what you wrote before",
            "UPDATE:I got the ads removed but i tried recording my first video tonight. I spent a half hour recording some very important and personal things only to have the app delete it when i was done. Then just now i was trying to back up all my older recordings AND IT DELETED EVERY THING BUT MY FIRST RECORDING FROM THE LAST YEAR. I'M DEVASTATED. THESE WERE THINGS I WILL HAVE NO RECORD OF NO. IF I COULD GIVE - STARS I WOULD Upgraded to pro and it took my money and I still have ads. Not awesome.",
            "Very nice app with password protection where we can add text, audio images..however we should also be able to add videos and the text scrolling is not smooth and we should be able to select multiple pictures and add it our entry..very nice app though",
            "I love this app. It works perfect, but I'm sometimes scared it might crash. My diary is of much value and I dont want to loose any documentation."

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

Thank you for creating an English version of this app. I've been waiting for it actually.",

I've used this app for 3 years and find it really useful for practicing written Korean in a quick daily activity. The amount of English on the app has definitely increased recently so I think that if you can't read Korean, the app is still pretty self explanatory! 🌸",

We can also change oir background, our font style..it is excellent but i want a thing that is live background but as i am a army girl so i recommend to get a live background of bts or V.. Or any butterfly or nature background. By the way the theme is very nice.. I like that very much...",
            "This app is extremely slow but it is what it is. As much as it is slow, it does keep my thoughts written down and is hidden so im happy. Im just not fond of the pink cover. Im a grl but i like black and purple type of colours",
            "Honestly... not the worst, but not the best either. Lets start with the great stuff. The lock really works and i ABSOLUTELY love how you can change the background and personalise it with your own photos. Now. Sometimes it shows the wrong day and I don't notice. Then, I finish writing my entry and save it. When I'm done, I realise I lost my diary entry from yesterday because I saved my other one. So annoying!!!",
            "Good app to keep the chain of memories with good security. Along with the memories in the form of text, we can also add the emotions to that in the form of emojis and also can attach the pic for each day to express the memories.",
            "I love this app so much! This app is great very best to write our secrets and I love it soooo much I rate a 5 star good job keep up the great work! 🍪🍪"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "I like this app There is more design to colour and there is ideas for Rangoli, can draw and magic , save the drawing and sent to someone else ,so i like this app",
            "All my saved work disappeared with the latest update. Other than that I really like the app. But why put that much time into it if everytime the app updates all your work is gone.",
            "This would be a higher rating, except that there is no more save button. When I tried to save my finished page, it saved from only halfway done. Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ❣️ the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "One of the best mobile games I've ever played, not even including the fact that I have almost every single ubisoft game, but this is the first mobile ubisoft game I have actually liked. There are some things that could be better, like the death animations and the kill animations, but other than that it's an amazing game, 11/10 would recommend.",
            "It's really great! I've been playing this game for a while now and it always entertains me. Would've given it five stars but there's a problem. The game crashes when my shark dies and then when I reopen it, I don't get the gold or exp I had earned. It doesn't happen always, but the crashing rates have increased. Please fix it... It's hard to play 10mins in one round and then earning nothing at all. Thank you.",
            "This game is super awsome! But just one thing about it: The larger sized sharks. Once you get near one you pretty much can't escape unless you have a lot of stamina. And once you die from them and press the \"Save me!\" button you have almost no time to swim away, and then they bite you once and you're almost dead. I just think you need to give an 8 second head-start before the larger sharks can catch you.",
            "This game is so freaking awesome!!! However, the control system could use a ln addative, a joystick option that keeps the joystick in a fixed place down in the left hand corner, oh and the health drain is ridiculous! Health shouldn't drop that rapidly, you should maybe.... fix that, please? Other than that? GREAT game!",
            "This game is amazing. No pay to win. Great amount of skippable ads. You eventually get every shark from grinding enough. I just grinded out 280 gems and bought the Robo-Shark. Great time killer. Especially without Wi-Fi :P Get this game it's so worth it. Ubisoft, this game is amazing and almost perfect. Just a bit of tweaking and this game is number one. Great job!"

            "More than an organ keyboard. Fun. Does have echo on some instruments. I hope you will add more loops as default, although there is options for downloads. Great. This is like a mini mobile recording studio. Alot packed on the panel, so would be great if you simplify it. I will check back in a year to see if there are any upgrades.",
            "For me, its the best!!! And awesome not only it has sooooooo many as in soo many features but i also think that i can create a song here i love the effect, the tunes, i still haven't explored it all yet but i will and i know that it will have amazing cool features i recommend it to everyone who knows how to compose songs it, and to everyone who loves to play and listen to cool musics it depends on you but i definitely recommend it thank u!!!! 👌👌👌👌😊😊",
            "Really nice sounds. Looks like it does a lot, but can't figure it out. \"User's guide\" not helpful. Tells you what each button is for, but doesn't tell you how to use it. Any YouTube videos I found show sounds, but not how it works. How do I record? Can I record in steps, or do I have to press the keys in real time? How do I get it into my DAW? And many, many more questions. 4 stars until I get everything working. I will happily pay the $10 for VIP if I figure it out.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it is absolutely amazing. It has an incredible array of instruments and options. It is also very user friendly. This is one of my most favorite apps.",
            "This is quite a good app. But I have still many features to try. The sound is so good that I tried to play by bluetooth with my Boat Avante. The latency was terrible and the app was practically unusable by bluetooth. While using on the mobile sometimes when I give a 3 chord combination like D chord or G chord the entire screen shrinks to a small strip and I have to press the cancel button to restore to normal size which destroys a beautiful song being played."

            "Although this games is very nice and satisfying, it contains a LOT of AD'S. I'm sick of the ad's covering half the slimes I play with and I've made. To make it more worse it takes TOO MUCH TIME TO MAKE MY OWN SLIME. Another thing that there is little star below which goes to a place with Guess The Slime n Painting, whenever I choose Guess the slime, it automatically changes chosen colour by the correct colour. So, I'll just request to improve the things I've mentioned above. Also it's a good app",
            "It is a weird game BAD!! HORRIBLE AND ANNOYING!! Because it keeps getting ads everytime i think someone said that it takes 10 to 12 minutes to load of making your own slime. He or she is so right and also it takes a lot of WIFI. This game is a fraud. .",
            "I love this game 10 out of 10 wood Install This house with stress After seeing all the bad Reviews I decided to still try it because it's just an opinion I personally really liked IT was a very fun game it deals with stress And I had barely any ads and if they were ads I could hit close",
            "Terrible. This game is extremely low quality, and it takes forever for the slime to load. GARBAGE. I gave it only one star cuz the sound of the slime is great, but everything else is poop.",
            "I love this! I was stressed when i got it, because my brother was being mean sooo, I got this because it sounded nice, and lovely, and it was! I unlocked four slimes already! I love this game! I am not stressed any more! I don't care about the bad things, like, the adds, but any way, THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH FOR PUTING THIS OUT THERE!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!! Thanks! I love this game a lot!!!! This is great!!!!!! Thank you so much! I can't stop thanking you!! Thank you SOOOO much!!!!!!!"

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. And it contains less ads. nd its a very easy game. I love to play it👍👍keep it up I will also suggest to my friends. Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

            "I like the fact that I write down ALL my goals and things that i want to do and i can see all of them, then pick the ones that I want to work on today and the ones I want to work on tomorrow and so on. Also, organizing them into sections is a good feature as well. That way i feel i can see all my new years resolution and the steps that i must take to achieve them and drag and drop this step to do today and that step to do tomorrow.",
            "Many errors, the app is good but sometimes with the recurrent task do not work when I use desktop app it do not sync well and I lose many task and this is unpleasant. Pay for this app with this errors is a bad idea. I do no feel secure with app I lose taks and time. I hope the app get better. And the plan my day would be good if add the tasks in someday",
            "This still works pretty well, but I'm not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically. Edit: Nevermind, the sort order can be changed through the app. Thanks to the dev who pointed this out to me. You and your app have been helpful :)",
            "I love this app and use it in preference to my inbuilt calendars because it is so user-friendly and reminders really stand out. It does not seem to have any impact on my overall storage either - getting to be a problem for me. Really useful.",
            "I've removed all my other planner/list/grocery/schedule apps. I used to have so many for different things, but this app has it all! And it's so sleek and simple! I absolutely love it! And I'm looking forward to a free dark theme in the future, it's all I miss!"

Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",

So I don't know what happen since the recent update on the app. Please fix it or is it something else with my printer. I have network and wifi is good. So is it the app?",

It tries to connect me with HP Web Services (which past versions never required), which then gets me an \"invalid request\" error every time. Awful, awful, awful app. Nonexistent support from HP. Avoid!",

HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",

This is so inconvenient especially working at home with no other access. This printer was bought to be used. Please fix the. There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",

            "Amazing 👌👌 it feels like I am there hearing the animals thanks for the wonderful app to f animal noices all of all the animals. There is person saying that the sounds or inaccurate but I disagree with that I would recommend this app for uses thanks again for your time on this app.",
            "I will not recommend to download this App for anyone. Surely it does not match the most accure sounds with their real animals like, look it, Rhinoceros and Wolf sounds there is big different with their real sounds and ones in this app even Zebra and dog, and others still not accurate sounds. Too fake the sound of Mosquitoes. Totally it's misleading one avoid it. For me I will not recommend this for anyone.!"

Also, I find it very interesting that the app's logo matches with the date that I finally noticed my Google Calendar app. What a coincidence! I even thought that the logo is real-time before I learned that the 'date' or the '31' is actually part of the standard logo.",

Whatever takes more time in an app than on a laptop makes zero sense as a function of an app. Keep it simple. It's a calendar app.",

They just look like the branding/marketing team have taken over any they no longer look like they represent a symbol for the apps functionality rather a Google something. I'm beginning to question Google's direction with the inconsistent pixel experience now this garbage...",
            "I have been using this app for many years, however, the new goal-setting function is very inconsistent. I will set a goal to occur every day, and it will skip random days, with no way to re-include those skipped days. It also does not let you define the duration of your goal, which is quite daft. Goals must have dates in order to be effective. The 'smart' notifications are pretty silly; they remind you to complete your goal, and have an option to tap 'later', which defers goals by a whole day!",
            "New update hijacked my Outlook calendar & added notifications for all events, despite NO NOTIFICATIONS set in BOTH Outlook AND Google Calendar app. Update also caused Samsung Calendar to also trigger alarms for Outook events despite being previously disabled as well. Dev's suggestion to cancel alarms in Google app 1 by 1 for each Outlook event is not a fix. As I stated, NO NOTIFICATIONS is the default, so there's nothing to turn off when new events sync."

            "This is a classic \"caring for your pet\" game. Has more mini games than talking tom/talking angela/ the one with the purple thing that theyve made like 7 editions to/ also more custom options than all the other ones too. Its very kid friendly (im 19 i can justify even though i have no kids) the only way you can make friends is through email. Highly sugest",
            "i just love love this game but i don't lt really like how it makes me pay real mony to get the baby potion and the adult potion. But there is 4 bugs the first one is Whenever i get of the game and get back on it gliches and it makes it hard to play.

            "I used to play this all the time when I was about 8 (back when Kindles were a big thing) and this honestly takes me back to my childhood. Never had any issues (personally) and would recommend 👌",
            "I haven't been playing this game for 3 years. But this game is normall ehe theres like no ads, um.. Theres a creepy thing about this game.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOOD👍!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! 😮 add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable 😂😂😂😂😂 Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. 😀😃👍👍👍👍👍......"

What kind of sense does that make? And then when I try to give feedback on the app from within the app, you send me to download another app. Why the hell should I have to download an app to give feedback on your app?? I quit.

The confirmation letter includes an address for using on line without the app... Go figure, odd way of doing things, but it worked. Just need to save the address to my browser? But, note the web site shows on google as not secure. As in don't put anything personal on there. I would also question the security of the app.",

After using more than a year for this application, I am surprised by an update request that allows access to files and knowing where I am, I did not allow these new options, which led to closing the application, I repeatedly tried to open the application without interest, I tried to remove the application and reinstall it and agree to the new terms, and this is what was done , But the result was the loss of 100's of important files stored in the application !!! I am very sad..",
            "Very disappointing. I installed on my new phone and everything moved over but now is gone. I haven't used it for awhile but it is not at all as I remember. I'm looking for a new diary app. I even went to the web private diary and logged in there and everything is gone there also worst app ever.",
            "This is a very nice app. Easy to use and simple. The only thing is that I can't get my old entries after changing the phone. I have changed my Phone and installed new app in new phone but there is no any old entry. Can you please help ?"

            "I'm giving this edition a 2-star rating because the newer version (Touchgrind BMX 2) is incompatible with all 7 devices I own. Way to go, Dev Team. Congratulations on a game that excludes so many devices. Maybe BMX 3 will be exclusive to just 1 specific device. Note: this is sarcasm and should not be interpreted as positive feedback.",
            "Awesome game, and no ads which is amazing. The only thing that will probably make the game a but less enjoyable is if you have a sensitive screen like me it can throw off all the tricks and landings. Other than that, there's also not many tricks. The last thing I don't like is that it sometimes doesn't count it when you complete a challenge but that might just be me. Other than that I love it so much and find it really fun 👍",
            "It is a good game but the game has all worlds money purchaseable. Wish it could have a free world. And some people who complain about the 10 jumps, read this before you say there aren't, go slow for the first 2 jumps, land on the center then fall off, then after that you can play the game normally.",
            "5 stars this game is awesome and not an absolute waste of time. Just two problems. You have to buy the different levels with real money and it sucks cos i have almost completed the first level. Also there isnt 10 jumps in the first level so you cant do the challenge. But i would recommend this game to you.",
            "All tought the controls are way better than touch grind skate, This game needs a free play mode were you can mess around. I dont want the game to end when I'm playing. I don't know why the controls in this game are so good but on touchgrind skate the controls are 🗑"

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying.

            "Easy to load. No ads. Works as advertised. Not a five -yet. If it's still going good a few months from now, I'll come back and upgrade my rating. Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",

            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

            "Hello, I was wondering if there is a way I could restore the daily journal I wrote two years ago(between the last months of 2018 and 2019). I thought I used the back up of google drive, but it turns out I didn't. Besides writing gratitude, I used it as a diary. I really would love to have what I wrote restored. Is there anyway you could help me with that?  For your information, I used the same e-mail I am sending you to login for the app. Thank you for your reply in advance!",
            "2020 edit: cannot login. Paid the Lifetime premium and nothing has been updated in 4 years!? I smell scam. I hope Play store shuts this down. I want a refund. years worth of photos attached to entries have been corrupted and I am a premium user. I sync after every entry. The devs need to figure this out quickly.",
            "I have been using this app for the past 8 years. But for the first time when I try signing into my account, it keeps saying sign in failed, try again later. Very disappointed",
            "Why I can't able to sign in with my gmail id.it shows sign in failed. I've been using this for years and I need some important information from it. Please do something to fix it",
            "This is the BEST app I've come across for not only journal writing, but also for notes, blogging, lists, articles, and books. The many options available for appearance and feel make it VERY user friendly for someone like me who needs an app that is simple to use but sophisticated in results! It's important to me having something that is functional AND aesthetically pleasing! Better Diary gives me BOTH!!"

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

            "Honestly the options are nice..I m using for 2 yrs but once it's gets deleted it can't be recovered so pls do something about it . otherwise I won't be interested in using it anymore",
            "I LOVE this app! I work for several rubber stamp companies as a designer. it helps me to keep track of what the heck I did on different designs. I do pay the monthly fee for the app and I am happy I do. the only things I would LOVE to see in future updates is the ability to sync the app between my devices (i have the app on my phone and tablet) And I would live to be able to take a photo in the project planner section. Would give 5 stars if I could do those 2. Thank you so much for the app!!",
            "Ok, so it's pretty good and creative, and I enjoy it. I was pretty disappointed though. Subscriptions, why subscribe every month for two or three things. yes there is different offers but seriously cant you have a pay once, get it forever or every ad you watch u can use it. Otherwise i would reccomend it, it's real good.",
            "This app would be given a 5 stars only if we could add our own title orr start off in your own way. When i had a diary in my younger years, i didnt start off with ,I Like, because it didnt seem right. Still this app is very useful since it has a password and i still have my phone in my pocket every day😂. Please improve or reply. Thank you",
            "It's not a diary if I can't look back at what I wrote: looking things up 'By types' doesn't let you open anything, & everything is labeled by date. It's useless without a comprehensive way to actually see everything at once. (Edit: the only \"button on top\" is a calendar that brings up TODAY - it does NOT show you \"all\" like they just said in their reply) The style seems a bit basic & childish, leaving you wanting to change things that are already in place. As of now, it's useless & a headache."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",

            "I think this game is amazing! Definitely recommend! 👍The graphics and flow of the movement is very good! And yes there's ads. (Obviously) But unlike most other games like these, the ads barely even bother you! The only trouble I'm having is sometimes when I collect keys or coins it lags just a bit, not enough to mess up the entire \"round\" though. Also anytime I'm trying to buy something (With in-game coins) It will switch to another thing like toppings or food items and buy those instead.PlzFix",
            "Game is fun but the levels actually only repeat it's self, i got all the foods with in 2 days, i got the unicorn in 1 day and the space cat in the 2nd day, i reccomend this game if u like saticefying games, add a longer and better level every now and then it would be great,i gave 3 stars because of the repeating levels and the quick ones to and because it is not very creative 👍🏻🙃",
            "I just downloaded this game and I already like it!Its very fun and reminds me of when me and my mum were baking together!It is hard to keep the cream on the foods,yes but besides from that I recommend downloading it! Also something pretty Annoying can happen where there is too many adds but the game 'yes that dress'(wich I'll recommend downloading to)has adds every next button so the game 'yes that dress'has more adds",
            "To say it's kinda boring but normally it's a very good game it's so much fun and it has a bit of slow motion when I ice the cream on top of the strawberries and waffles and just installed this game today!I'm 8 years old but this is 3 stars it's kinda boring",
            "I saw this in an ad ao i decided to try it. The idea itself sounlds not to bad, but it turned out to be a bit laggy and had this vibration everytime i squeezed the cream? I think the vibration is the point but i think the vibration feeling is annoying and bothering"

It should be smoother. Also, there are many ads, but you can remove them and the price is perfectly reasonable. I would recommend.",
            "I like the Game!! VERY satisfing! You can even MAKE you own slime!! You can customize the slime ANYway ya like!! You can also take a picute of yourself and it turns to slime! Also the slime makes satisfing noises! And the slime won't get ALL over that new shirt!!",

So that's not a problem , I recommend all to download this awesome app , those are ok with the adds then they should download this app ☺️ I'm ok with adds and those have trouble with adds then they it's not necessary to download and they adds don't come during ur play so you don't have much prob with adds,bye ☺",

            "I'm sorry. I really do want to give it 5 stars, but I can't. The reason why is because it's choppy. While running I can barely get around because it's really choppy. I have to walk everywhere. Not to mention the movement is a little odd and the stile. Well the stile is fine. But the other things I can't play with those.",
            "it was fun but there was a bug to this game it froze and takes so long to lvl up and it's lagging and too many ads but the only thing to take away the ads is you have to purchase and the only mode that helps you lvl up faster is offline not online because if someone on the online kill an enemy they only get food not you disappointeding my lvl is 6",
            "It is a good game; however I bought tbe Forest and Island and I keep trying to download it, but it says \"Can't download check your internet connection and free up some space.\" Both my connection and space are perfect fine so for tjis issues it's three stars. Plus cub(s) statistics go down away to quickly.",
            "I really like this game I accidentally deleted it and I was so mad actually really liked it so this is why I gave it a 5-star cos it's really good you can have like little carb but then when you have to let you know it's very sad and I like like yeah if it's a boy you have to let it go but I keep it safe email with you didn't because he was just saying the pride anyway but it's really good"

            "I wouldn't say its addicting or fun or anything. I'd say, it's good for people that just want a game, they don't care what game it is. I like it a lot, don't get me wrong, its a great game but everytime I play it, I feel like I deserve more. This game is awfully good but surprisingly bad. The levels do get a bit challenging as you move on, but with that, it lags my phone. Sometimes, when I watch an ad, it takes me back to a level I already finished, which is annoying. 3 stars because it's boring",
            "Your game is terrible, you only get like 10 moves. I would not download this, it takes up a lot of data. It is really bad. Please fix the moves, then I'll give you a better rating. I'd suggest you to not download this game before they fix this bug. I get strict sometimes, because I can't just find a good game to play when I'm bored for example: when I'm using a hotspot; when im on a roadtrip. Please fix this bug, then I might give you 4, or 5 Stars. And the Ads are constantly playing.",
            "Fun game. Ads are ridiculous and I am never going to watch an ad just to break one of the pies. For everyone out there, PUT ON AIRPLANE MODE. And also future apps, use airplane mode and never watch a stupid ad again. I will gladly pay $1 to remove ads, but anything above a dollar is not worth it. I understand why games need ads, but an ad forced upon you in the MIDDLE OF A GAME? Nope. I won't support that. Make removable ads a buck and I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "This game should tell us how many moves we have. Literally every other game that does something similar to this will tell us how many moves we have left. Is this intentional? I don't think it should be. Also, there is nothing fast-paced about this game. If you want it to be, maybe add a timer or different levels of difficulty if you haven't already. Each level of difficulty will give you a certain amount of time to complete the level. I'd enjoy the game a lot more if it was like that.",
            "VERY POOR, PLAY THIS IN AIRPLANE MODE! This games developers obviously want nothing more than an ad revenue. I will never understand how a game will make you watch so many ads just to get past 1 level. As soon as you score a whole pizza (every pizza) there is an ad. They don't even wait for the level to be completed. Not worth $2.99 for no ads."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

Also like the fact that it dates your entries as well what time you wrote them and the fact that you can lock it with a passcode so it is indeed private. As for the ads, yes it does have them but I upgraded and the price was at low cost, but a pittance considering the great quality I received in return. What I truly appreciate about the app. Photos also I can upload. No problem in giving it all five stars.",
            "24 hour format doesn't work. Every time you have an entry saved it returns to AM/PM format every new entry or edit that entry. I did change the setting 24 hour format in setting menu. It changes back to am pm each time. Duh",

            "So far, so good. Easy to use and secure. I've only just begun to use this, to be fair, so I've not found any problem yet. Nonetheless, my needs are simple, and I expect this app will perfectly fill my requirements. 😊 UPDATE: Because I really like this app I have it installed on two devices, and would love to know if it is possible to synchronise them. Can you please advise me on this? It's SO tedious entering the details twice! Thank you in anticipation 😊",
            "As an app it is nice. However if you don't buy pro version you can't export passwords in .csv format. Only .db format is available and there are no instructions from developer how to access the data (it's encrypted ofc). I tried everything that Google advised, still no success. Would like some instructions on data access in this .db file",
            "I don't understand how it works? What is it supposed to do? Does it automatically fill in the passwords or what? I do not see where it explains exactly how the program works... Now that Ihave had some time to familiarize myself with your app I can see that it is actually pretty functional. You need to compose a concise tutorial that explains how the app works for new users.",
            "I would give this a 5 star, however, the only additional feature that would make this nice (if already a feature I cannot figure it out) is to be able to have sub labels. Example: top label \"Medical\" then within that label have several other labels \"Mine\", \"Hers\", \"Kids\", etc... Kinda like a folder structure in Microsoft Windows. Right now, if I have a label named \"Medical\" then I have to put all in that one label which makes it unorganized.",
            "I just started using this app and it is awesome! and I only have to remember 1 pass to get access to all my passwords! and if you are the owner of the app and Reading this can you please make a face id option so it will recognise you face? Remember face id not Touch ID because I'm using a Chromebook not an android phone so pleeeeeeeeeeeeas face id and also please not in pro version because I am a kid and I don't have any money. Just one more thing even though I've already said this this app is awesome!"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

However I like how after u pay for the songs with ur coins u dont have to pay again, but u have to watch adverts if u want to play ur bought songs, which i dont like😤. But its good👍🏾",

            "I used to enjoy the app, and was getting pretty good with my skill level, then out of nowhere the app started acting glitchy and periodically freezing up right in the middle of a song, and the notes became unresponsive to the touch, and would score you as though your timing was off and you missed them as they came in line with the keys and the intended time to strike or tap them. It's extremely frustrating to be scored so low when it's not a low skill set, but a buggy app causing it. Please fix",

            "10/12/20 - This app used to work great, then Android 11 came. I am using a Pixel 2 device that otherwise works with everything. The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",
            "This app has been amazing for 10 years straight! I can't believe it's been that long. Dear developer of this app, thank you for your attention to simplicity, detail and simply having the courage to not bloat this app over time! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "It does what it does. Would like the option to have data stored in the cloud only, and load pictures and videos when needed. More options in slideshow would be great (time per picture, randomize button more accessible).",

My only dislike was the back color was white so it was uneasy on the eyes and the font was small and thin also making it hard to see and just hurting my eyes. I wish I could change the color of the background and change the font size and boldness. I am using this app on my laptop so I don't know if that effects it or not.",
