I tested it out on some products in my house, and what really impressed me is how lightning FAST it is when scanning and looking up products. Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",

The suggested or related foods are always some expensive wholefoods brands. I just want an app that can tell me what foods I normally eat are safe and what I need to find alternative gluten free products for. Not very helpful.",

            "This really is a great app. Especially if you are visiting an unknown location. I would give this 5 stars except for one thing: you charge for premium for content that is largely gathered by your customers. I understand the need for the income, but see no compensation for the contributers. I would like to see something like 'free short-term premium for X reviews/additions'.",
            "Awesome app. Have been using for years, and they have the most expansive reviews in even off the main road areas. Have used in other countries and was really helpful in our first trip to Barcelona. Travel in states we have used for first time trips - Chicago, Nashville, Kingsport, road trips between cities, Portland, Oregon Coast, Oahu just as examples.",
            "must have for anyone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. I'm not thrilled with the new \"premium\" features, but I spoke to the developer and understand why he implemented them. and there are a couple ways around using them, if you're cash-strapped like me and don't eat out enough to need them.",
            "It has definitely been useful in some countries, but not in others. Really needs a lot more input from users to be as helpful as possible. Frequently I have to add new places as there are no reviews - and the app fights you tooth and nail when you try to add places. But we will get there! And I would still say it is a \"must have\" for a traveling celiac.",
            "Every useful feature is now behind a pay wall. Used to have several features I've paid for off and on over the years, now there is absolutely no point to the free version of the app. And the price isn't worth it for questionable crowd sourced information that might be detrimental to your health."

        "description": "The purpose of my app is simple: to better the lives of those living with celiac disease and anyone else who must eat gluten-free; to create a close-knit community where people in the gluten-free community come to discover, to learn, to share, and to connect, all to make their lives easier and healthier.\r\n\r\nLiving a 100% gluten-free life certainly has it challenges: physically, mentally and socially. Using the Gluten Dude app will help alleviate those challenges.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: EATING OUT SAFELY\r\nEating out is one of the more stressful parts of having celiac disease. One crumb is all it takes to set off the autoimmune response. Everything that is fun and spontaneous about eating out can be overshadowed by the anxiety of whether you can get through your meal unscathed.\r\n\r\nSolution: A directory of only 100% gluten-free restaurants, guaranteeing you a safe meal. Each restaurant includes images, a description, reviews, ratings, directions, etc. The app currently covers the US, Canada, Paris, Italy, London, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia, with more locations coming. \r\n\r\nNote: Recommended but Non-100% GF restaurants are now included on the app as well but are clearly delineated. These restaurants are personally vetted before being added to the app. NEW RESTAURANTS ADDED EVERY DAY!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: GETTING BAD/WRONG ADVICE\r\nThe internet is littered with falsehoods and dangerous information regarding celiac disease. People are looking for answers to their problems, quickly and accurately, and they are not sure where to turn or who to trust, putting their health in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nSolution: A forum where fear mongering and misinformation will be strongly discouraged. Varying opinions? Absolutely. But no \"McDonalds French Fries are gluten free\" kind of stuff. There are a number of topics where you’ll be able to chime in with questions, answers and advice. The forum includes Ask the Community, Ask Gluten Dude, Share Your Celiac Story, and more.\r\n\r\nYou also have access to videos from yours truly (Gluten Dude), where I answer reader emails, throw out some celiac rants and talk about the world of celiac disease.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: ISOLATION\r\nCeliac disease is a very misunderstood disease and can be quite isolating. I've received so many emails over the years from people whose own friends and family don't take their disease seriously; who don't get invited out to eat because they're \"too difficult\"; who are bullied at school simply because they can't eat gluten. And most of the time, there is no one there to turn to, to listen to you, to understand you.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION: Live chat. This app will connect you with others in the celiac/GF community, allowing one on one private chats. You’ll even have the option of providing your zip code, allowing people to search for others by location.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: FINDING GLUTEN-FREE BEER\r\nBeer, sadly, is not gluten-free. The most popular \"gluten-free\" beers on the market today are actually \"gluten-removed\" and are not safe to drink. There are a handful of amazing 100% gluten-free beers out there, but they can be difficult to find.\r\n\r\nSolution: The Gluten Dude app shows the stores, bars and restaurants where people can purchase gluten-free beer. The user will be able to search by any location and each location will show which specific gluten-free beers each establishment carries. Cheers!\r\n\r\nAND LASTLY...WHO THE HECK IS GLUTEN DUDE?\r\nMy real name is Scott but within the celiac and gluten-free communities, I'm known as Gluten Dude, a popular, passionate and outspoken celiac disease advocate. I was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2008 and I launched my blog in 2011. Here are a few kudos from my fellow celiacs:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You changed the journey for me.\" - Joyful\r\n\r\n\"You make me smile, you make me cry, and you make me mad. But most of all, you make me grateful that I don’t have to figure this all out on my own.\" - Darlena\r\n\r\n\"Your latest post is why my son wants to be Gluten Dude when he grows up.\" - Denise",

        "description": "Gluten free recipes to stay healthy. Gluten free diet is a type of diet that omits all gluten containing food. Gluten is present in foods like wheat, rye, triticale, barley, malt, and their by-products. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople suffering from celiac disease are often prescribed with a Gluten free diet. Celiac disease is a hereditary auto-immune condition in which the finger-like nutrient absorptive surface of the small intestine called “villi” becomes inflamed or damaged which can hinder nutrient absorption; hence, leading to malnutrition. Common symptoms of Celiac disease are bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. By omitting gluten from the diet, the patient can improve nutrient absorption and inhibit further complications. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome people find it difficult to adjust to a gluten free diet that is why patience and proper meal planning is a must. This recipe app lets you discover many alternatives that will allow you to still enjoy your favorite foods but without the gluten. \r\n\r\n\r\nNavigating recipes using this app is very easy.

            "Having Celiac Disease a dedicated kitchen is a must when traveling. Unfortunately there aren't many dedicated gluten free kitchens but because of this app I was able to plan a getaway to have my safe birthday meals without having to spend so much time trying to read every location that comes up with the word gluten free. I still confirm with the that they are a dedicated kitchen before going, so far no issues. The map is a great feature.",
            "App has potential. At the present moment it does not locate anything at all, not even big cities like Philadelphia which have a ton of GF establishments and/or offerings. The first day I used it a few months back it introduced me to a bakery that was new too me. Aside from that, nothing! Hope you figure out how to remedy the glitches, best of luck!",
            "Location Services REQUIRED. Why can't I bypass that and input in a zip code or town and state? It's foolish to assume I want to find places where I currently am every time I open the app. You wait for the app to load and can't change the search location. So much for planning out restaurants before traveling.",
            "It is so wonderful to be able to find safe places to eat with this app! Richmond, VA doesn't have many options, but I now know of 3 new places that I had no clue about. This will definitely make my next traveling experience much much safer and less anxiety-ridden.",
            "I love this app! I found some great new places to eat close to home. I also travel a lot and this has been very helpful. It's so nice to get to try new places and not have to go to the old standbys when I'm on the road."

But it has still a long way to go, many additives are missing, but keep up the good work {edit: OK, I will try to collect the missing additives} Also – for the information to be correct I strongly suggest that you include if the additive MAY BE WHEAT DERIVED. That way a user can make an informed decision. Many Celiac people are still too sensitive to have any additive that was wheat based – like mannitol, MSG, etc.",

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

It was created to perform as an actual gluten-free dishes collection from restaurants, where all the dishes are uploaded by us - Celiacs!\r\n\r\nSuffering from Celiac disease? Living on a gluten free diet? Here's your solution for eating out! \r\nCeliHack is the best gluten free restaurant guide that is 100% based on actual recommendations! \r\nWhat does this mean? \r\n\r\n- If you enjoyed a delicious and safe gluten-free meal at a Celiac-friendly restaurant - upload your recommendation and let other people know!\r\n\r\n- Had a meal that was supposed to be gluten free but suffered from Celiac side effects afterwards? Warn other people!\r\n\r\n- Want to have a gluten free breakfast, lunch or dinner at a restaurant and you don't know which you can really trust? With CeliHack you can find out where Celiacs near you ate and marked as safe! \r\n\r\nAre you a Celiac too? Download the app and help us build the world's biggest gluten free dishes collection! \r\n\r\nMain advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Presenting not just a list of restaurants which claim to serve gluten-free dishes, but actually showing those dishes, photographed and uploaded by other Celiacs who ate the dishes and shared how they felt after doing so!\r\n\r\n2. Based on the wisdom of the crowd: each user can comment on others’ recommendations. So, if someone uploaded a dish that you already ate and had a different experience with it (for better or worse), you can add your review to the existing “dish card” and notify others about your experience too. \r\n\r\n3. The app may change the way restaurants handle our food… maybe they don’t even know their GF dishes are not actually GF.\r\n\r\n4. Since the database should be built by us - Celiacs - it’s worldwide and can help us anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to start making a difference, we need volunteers to start uploading gluten-free dishes in their location. Since the app is new, it pretty much has no dishes in it, so you’ll probably see this empty screen when first opening it, asking you to start contributing content… We hope you will!\r\n\r\nThe app is free and will ALWAYS be free to Celiacs!\r\n\r\nIf we all cooperate and share our recommendations - we’ll bring traffic to the restaurants which take care of us, and it may convince the ones who don’t to start doing so too!\r\n\r\nPlease help us by uploading dishes to the app. A strong worldwide community will help us all by raising awareness! \r\n\r\nHow can you give back to the community?\r\n\r\n- Opened the app in a place where no one has uploaded a dish before? Be the first to upload a dish there and help future visitors! \r\n- Got sick from eating, but not sure it is from gluten? Report it (anonymously) anyway; if the restaurant is good, others will balance it out in the future with their reviews.\r\n- Came across inappropriate content (e.g. photo or text) in the app? Report the dish.\r\n- Most importantly, keep sharing gluten free dishes you ate out and tell other Celiacs how you felt after the meal. \r\n\r\nCelihack Features include:\r\n\r\n- Swipe through real recommendations of meals and choose if you like it or don’t like it\r\n- Add meals to ‘My Favorites’ and save for when you get hungry and want to eat at a safe Celiac friendly restaurant\r\n- Upload your own recommendations or rejections after eating a gluten free meal\r\n- Find Celiac friendly restaurants near you\r\n\r\nWith CaliHack you can easily find gluten friendly restaurants around you! Download now and find restaurants that offer a gluten free menu and enjoy a gluten free breakfast, gluten free beer and more! \r\n\r\nThis app was created by a Celiac, especially for people with Celiac, to help keep your gluten free diet safe!\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH US\r\nWe are always happy to receive feedback from our users to help improve the app: \r\n\r\nEmail- celihack.team@gmail.com\r\nWebsite- http://celihack.com/\r\nFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/CeliHack\r\nInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/celihack/",

            "I was excited to use this app to avoid egg products. It seemed quite user friendly. I read previous reviews that it doesn't have a very good database for products. I scanned various items in my home (about 15) between condiments, various crackers, cookies, bars etc. Some I knew were egg-free, some I knew were not, some I didn't know and I only had 5 identify that they did not contain my allergen and the rest were not found. This won't be helpful for me and my family, so I uninstalled it.",
            "This app is a great concept but needs a larger database to be more useful. it's lacking several common things such as cereals, pastas etc. I scanned about about 20 things from my pantry but only got results on 5. Keep expanding the data set, this could be a wonderful tool.",
            "Would be helpful to put a chocolate anaphylactic allergy or an option for people to edit the allergy list. Also would be nice for audio playback for those that have a hard time seeing",
            "It has absolutly no database it was a great concept but this app is useless",
            "Do not get this app if you are trying to acually use it. Thos app was created by a middle school atusent and doesn't work when you scan most products I scanned milk to test it and the app said I could have it. Before you scan anything the app asks for your allergies and I put Dairy and then is when I scanned the milk and it said I could have it. Over all this app is NOT a function app."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",

            "This is a very addictive sites to look at ingredients but no longer possible to use it on browser unless you just browse by the category only but good to look at nutrition fact.",
            "I began using this app when my doctor recommended I do the low fodmap diet for 6 weeks. I thought this would make shopping for specific foods a lot easier. Boy, was I wrong. It is not accurate when you scan items in the store. For example, I would scan items, and it would say to avoid this item because of a certain ingredient in it, like soy. I would then look at the ingredients on the product and nowhere would it be listed. I would not recommend this app.",
            "So far so good! My only suggestion would be to add a filter menu to searches / scanned items / lists, which provides options for sorting by food groups, brands, descending/ascending number rating, and excellent, good, poor, etc. matches only. As it is, looking through lists and searches is a nightmare when you have a LOT of items to look through. Another helpful feature would be to add an option to filter out duplicate items in searches--I once had a search give me 10+ dupes for several items.",
            "I was reluntant at first to try this app due to a lot of negative reviews and comments. I just found out some food allergies that is includes in lots of foods, such as wheat, and this app is a good help. It also helps with other ingredients you want to avoid, such as sugar, etc. It even shows you foods that will be good for you to choose that disclides everything, which is good for someone new to a bad allergy trying to find new foods to eat. So far, I love this app"

        "title": "Gluten-Free Diet Recipes",
        "description": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.\r\n\r\nGluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten.[10] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak.\r\n\r\nGluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.\r\n\r\nA gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value.

        "descriptionHTML": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.<br><br>Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten.[10] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.<br><br>In addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak.<br><br>Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.<br><br>A gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet. If commercially prepared, gluten-free replacement products are used, choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. Furthermore, they contain protein of higher nutritional quality than those of wheat, and in greater quantities.<br><br>Feedback:-<br>If you have any suggested features or improvement, please leave a comment.

        "description": "FODMAP Helper - Diet Companion\r\nThis app makes identification of high and low FODMAP foods easier to help you with your FODMAP friendly diet. This can be helpful in reducing symptoms for people with IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance and various other food intolerances, food sensitivities, and stomach problems.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Comprehensive list of foods and whether or not they are low FODMAP foods, to make finding foods that won't exacerbate your IBS easier.\r\n- Search by food name and category.\r\n- General FODMAP Diet and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and - \r\n- Lactose Intolerence and other food sensitivities info.\r\n- Additional details on the specific breakdowns of each food and whether it is high, medium, or low in the main categories of Polyols, Oligos, Fructose, and Lactose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Features Include:\r\nMy Experience - Log your personal experience with foods to determine if a food works for you regardless of its FODMAP content. Rate whether you had a good or bad reaction to a food after eating it, then leave detailed notes so that you know for next time how said food will affect you.\r\n\r\nCommunity Experience - See how the community has reacted to a food via anonymized My Experience ratings. This will let you know if the majority of users of the app had a good or bad reaction to a food.\r\n\r\nMy Experience and Community Experience data analysis - Advanced graphs and data analysis present the my experience and community experience data to you in a useful and intuitive format to show you breakdowns of good and bad reactions to the various food categories as well as what your worst foods are.\r\n\r\nChallenge - The FODMAP Diet is an elimination diet for IBS, GI diseases, and food sensitivities. Once you've eliminated all high FODMAP foods from your diet, you can challenge foods to determine if they work for you. This lets you introduce these foods back into your regular meals one at a time and track your experience with each food after three days to determine if it will work in your FODMAP friendly diet. More details on challenges are contained within the app.\r\n\r\nAbout FODMAPs and IBS\r\nFODMAPs are short chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, especially for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, other food intolerances and stomach sensitivities. They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose and galactooligosaccharides, disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols).\r\n\r\nThe term is an acronym, derived from:\r\n\r\n*Fermentable\r\n*Oligo-\r\n*Di-\r\n*Mono-saccharides\r\n*And\r\n*Polyols \r\n\r\nAlthough these specific carbs are naturally present in the foods we eat, diet restriction has been found to improve symptom control in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and other stomach sensitivities. Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage. The main symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain, discomfort in association with frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nWe do not perform any testing ourselves.

It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause.",

        "description": "Para personas quien tienen desordenes relacionados al gluten [enfermedad celiaca (EC), sensibilidad al gluten no-celiaca, o dermatitis herpetiforme, lo cual es una manifestación en la piel de la EC], es necesario evitar el gluten para razones de salud. Gluten es el nombre genérico para ciertos tipos de proteínas que se encuentran en los granos trigo, cebada, centeno, y sus derivados. Cuando una persona con enfermedad celiaca ingiere gluten, ocurre una reacción inmune, lo cual daña el intestino delgado y puede causar síntomas y problemas de salud en casi cualquier parte del cuerpo. Aún cantidades muy pequeñas de gluten pueden causar problemas, independiente de que hay síntomas obvios o no. En cuanto a la sensibilidad al gluten no-celiaca, esta es una condición que todavía no está bien entendida, pero parece que el consumo de gluten no causa el mismo tipo de daño al intestino como es el caso en la enfermedad celiaca. Sin embargo, es también necesario eliminar el gluten de la dieta, ya que su consumo tiene diversos efectos adversos en la salud.\r\n\r\nLos siguientes granos, tal como derivados e híbridos de estos granos tienen que ser eliminados de la dieta:\r\nTrigo – incluye variedades como: duro, espelta, emmer, sémola, farro, y einkorn.\r\nCebada\r\nCenteno\r\nEscoge granos y harinas que son naturalmente sin-gluten, incluyendo arroz, maíz, soya, papa, tapioca, sorgo, quinua, mijo, trigo sarraceno, yuca, arrurruz, coco, tef, lino, chía y harinas de frijoles y nueces.\r\nInvestigaciones científicas indican que avena pura y no contaminada con gluten consumida en cantidades moderadas (hasta ½ taza de avena seca por dia), es tolerada por la mayoría de las personas con enfermedad celiaca. Escoge avena no contaminada que es certificada sin gluten, y consulte con su médico o dietista antes de incluir la avena en su dieta.\r\nOtros alimentos que naturalmente no contienen gluten son frutas y verduras; carnes frescas, aves, y pescado; frijoles y lentejas, nueces y semillas; y productos lácteos sencillos. Estos alimentos en sus formas puras no contienen gluten. Versiones procesados o con sabores agregados pueden contener ingredientes con gluten.\r\nExisten sustitutos sin gluten para alimentos que comúnmente son hechos de trigo, y son ampliamente disponibles en supermercados, tiendas de alimentos naturales, directamente de los fabricantes, y de sitios en el internet.\r\nBebidas alcohólicas destiladas, vinagres destilados, y vino son seguros para incluir en la dieta sin gluten. La mayoría de las cervezas, cerveza Inglesa y bebidas malteadas son hechos a base de granos que contienen gluten y NO son sin-gluten. Cervezas hechas de granos sin-gluten, como el sorgo, son sin-gluten.\r\n \r\n\r\nEtiquetado de Alimentos: Como determinar si un producto es libre de gluten\r\nPara seguir una dieta sin gluten con éxito, es muy importante leer las etiquetas de alimentos procesadas cuidadosamente.

            "Me encanta, el codigo de barras es buenísimo tiene una cantidad de productos increíble en su base de datos de distintas marcas blancas de supermercados y marcas en general. Super visual si eliges u tipo de alerta (lactosa por ejemplo) te saca en rojo si el producto escaneado lo tiene como ingrediente. De verdad muy muy útil tanto si tienes alergias o intolerancia como si quieres realmente saber que contiene lo que comes y no tienes una lupa a mano! Ademas te saca los productos relacionados pero en \"bueno para mi\", por ejemplo un pan de molde sin aceite de palma. Me encanta y lo estoy recomendando a mi grupo de intolerancia",
            "Fantástico, tiene un montón de productos (la mayoría de los que he probado) y ofrece un montón de información, incluso te explica para qué sirven los aditivos.  Imprescindible para gente con intolerancias. Por sacarle algún defecto, la interfaz no es de lo más bonito, pero merece la pena.",

All I have to do is scan the barcode & I receive my preferenced dietary report and/or alert of non-vegan ingredients.

Yeah, you have over 850,000 foods, but how many of your claims about those foods are accurate?"

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book 😭 I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "Its a great app and you can always add to it, being a vegan this app is a definite help. Just have to use common sense and Google translate when they have special articles in German.",

With this app it is easy to make healthier and eco friendlier buying decisions. A great thank you to the developers and please continue to expand the range of articles and continue to improve this app to be compatible with future IT development.",
            "The idea is very good. There are plenty of products reviewed. I love the recommended articles written by codecheck and the fact that they contain product recommendations. Minor bugs: - It may contain misleading information due to the fact that users can upload data about various products without those being certified by a mod. - The app is laggy from time to time - The user can upvote the same comment multiple times without the option to withdraw its vote if the button was mistakenly pressed.",
            "I love this app. It really helps to find unhealthy or alarming ingredients. For example microplastic, palmoil and chemicals which can affect my health. I can only recommend it to everyone!",
            "Great app that can gives you information about variety of products (food, cosmetics) by scanning the barcode. It also highlights potentially negative ingredients (e.g. high salts)"

When two or more (typically just a few, but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called &quot;mononeuritis multiplex&quot;, &quot;multifocal mononeuropathy&quot;, or &quot;multiple mononeuropathy&quot;, mononeuritis multiplex.",

Products can be gluten free but contain wheat. This is a dangerous description. I downloaded this because I travel regularly and have a wheat allergy. Shoving wheat (and believing this to be the same as a gluten allergy or coeliac disease) in with gluten shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the condition. Worrying in an allergy card app."

            "I've had a great experience with this app! The food is delicious and easy to cook. I absolutely love the shopping list feature. One thing I would really like is for an actual breakdown of how many grams of food each person should eat. For example, it tells me that I should eat 44% of the food, but we usually use a bit more ingredients than the recipe calls for (ie., Using 2lbs of meat instead of 1.75 lbs). Having an actual weight for the nutrition breakdown would be immensely helpful.",
            "I like this app but it needs some work to make it more user friendly. Like once you make a dish from your weekly menu you should be able to check it off. I love the shopping list and pantry feature, but how about letting me add stuff to the shopping list so that I don't have to have two lists?",
            "So far I am super impressed I am on an elimination diet and suspected to be sensitive to garlic. I listed garlic and garlic salt as an ingredient to avoid. My first experience with the suggested meals at Whole Foods, the kielbasa and substitutes all had garlic salt. I had to put back the ingredients for that meal when I canceled it. I lost time but I also saved a lot of time with the shopping list feature, It's amazing! Please consider integrating with Lose it!",
            "The layout and concept of the meal plans is great. However I accidentally created a meal plan and it won't let me delete it. I can only create a new one but then the ingredients are based off the previous meal plan that was created by accident and I can't reset it. I would contact support but they don't offer in app support?",
            "this is a great plan, for me personally. love the recipes, qiuck, easy and oh ao tasty. I don't stick to it like the bible, but use it as a tool to fit my lifestyle and it helps keep me on track. I'm down a total of 25 lbs in a yr 1/2 . it's definitely a lifestyle change. I totally recommend! Thanks Christine and coaches!"

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Track and analyse your bowel movements easily with Poop Tracker, then print out your stool analysis to quickly and easily share this data with your doctor.\r\n\r\nEver wonder what your bowel movements mean and how they affect your health? Curious to find out how frequently you suffer from bowel conditions like constipation, diarrhea, or bloody stool? Well now tracking your bowel movements is easier than ever. \r\n\r\nFind out what consistency, color, frequency, and urgency means for your health by tracking and analyzing these stats over time, then use that data to determine if any issues, such as IBS, or crohn's are present.\r\n\r\nPoop Tracker uses the Bristol Stool Scale to determine the quality of your poop and allows you to track and analyze your bowel movement data across all of your log entries.\r\n\r\nPoop Tracker features include:\r\n\r\n- Easily and quickly log every poop you take.\r\n\r\n- Track poop stats like colour, Stool type (Bristol Stool Scale), urgency, size, bloody stool, pain, and custom notes. These metrics can be important to determine if you have any bowel problems such as diarrhea, constipation, ibs (irritable bowel syndrome), colitis, crohn's disease or any other chronic condition.\r\n\r\n- Log 'No Poop' days and leave custom notes when you're constipated.\r\n\r\n- View and modify previous poop log entries with our comprehensive calendar view of your stool history.\r\n\r\n- Export or Import a CSV data file of all of your stool entries so your data can be saved and restored, or sent to your healthcare provider.\r\n\r\n- View a data breakdown and graph of your stool statistics over time including metrics like when your bowel movements happen and a day by day history (premium feature).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy track your bowel movements?\r\n\r\nTracking bowel movements can be a useful tool to gauge your stool health over time and potentially uncover any chronic problems you might have such as: IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome), Crohn's disease, Colitis, Celiac disease, Chronic Diarrhea, or Constipation by noticing patterns and irregularities in your stool that you may not have noticed otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you already suffer from a chronic bowel condition, you can also benefit from maintaining a poop log as it allows you to monitor the severity of your symptoms and progression of these life altering diseases over time and share this data quickly and easily with your doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Bristol Stool Scale:\r\n\r\nThe Bristol stool scale, or BSF scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human stool into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields. It is sometimes referred to in the UK as the Meyers scale. This is the scale used to track 'Type' in Poop Tracker because it is the most developed standard in many countries for categorizing feces.",

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",

E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",

I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

Appen använder förlagan som den officiella källan och omfattar samtliga 1098 livsmedel från 2012 års utgåva. Precis som i boken kan man genom appens omfattande lista snabbt och enkelt slå upp ingredienser, tillsatser och beteckningar som rör mat och livsmedel. Smart funktionalitet har lagts till: en sökfunktion hjälper dig att hitta det du letar efter, eller filtrerar listan enligt din anpassade profil.

Different processing methods will affect the cooking time and texture of the cooked oatmeal, but not the nutrients of the oats themselves, so whether they are rolled, steel-cut or instant, they are a good source of B vitamins, minerals, and soluble fiber and so much more!\r\n\r\nSo, is oatmeal actually healthy? \r\n\r\nIn short: yes, absolutely. They’re actually one of the best foods out there for heart health, thanks to its levels of beta-glucan (a type of fiber that can lower your cholesterol naturally) and avenanthramides (antioxidants that can clean the plaque from your arteries). Oatmeal is also a great pick if you’re watching your weight, thanks to its combination of fiber and water, which causes it to expand in your gut like a sponge so it keeps you feeling full for hours.\r\n\r\nIn this app, we prepared a science-based breakdown with the latest findings and health benefits of that morning bowl of oatmeal.\r\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Great app, simple to use and well organized, I liked almost all the recipes I've tried. One of the best features in my opinion is that it generates the shopping list based on your weekly menu. And super helpful to have a nutritionist available on chat for any questions or doubts. The only reason for 4 stars is that sometimes the app gets frozen and it needs to be restarted.",
            "Just downloaded and I think it looks good overall. One thing I noticed missing is calories for each given meal recipe especially when some of them are so very non healthy looking like a 'beef lasagna' made me question the diet's reliability. I will keep using for a weeks and update my review.",
            "I found this app and I tried for a week,after a week I starting to lose weight and seeing my six pack more visible now I just want to say thank you son much for the great work with the nutrition plan and keep it up you are doing a great job",
            "It plans weakly meals and snacks plus a g Shopping list. Recipes are so simple yet tasty",
            "I love this app, it's what I've been looking for for ages; guidance with my dietary requirements and a real person to talk to through chat. I had issues at first with the app, it didn't seem to work properly with my android but the team sorted it out. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to get their nutrition right. Ann is great and the app is easy to use. I enjoyed the meals too, they helped me vary my diet, which is something I didn't do before, and the recipes are easy to follow"

I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

And I can bookmark verses that help me with specific issues. Praise be to the most high for giving you version the aptitude to create such an important app.",
            "This app is the real treasure... I'm happy to have downloaded it... it makes life easy for me... during my difficult times, when I need the word of God... I just go through it, and I understand the thoughts of God on my situations... It's helping me now rebuild my relationship with my fiancee... I'm happy",
            "I absolutely love this bible app. It has no ads. It's easy to read, offering lots of bible translations. You can make notes, highlights, and bookmarks easily. It also has a cool option where you can make inspirational pictures from any verse of your choice, and easy to download and share the image. I love this app! God bless 🙂",
            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

        "description": "Celíacos Magazine app se enriquece ahora gracias a la nueva sección de recetas, donde recopilamos, organizamos y clasificamos todas las recetas de cocina que aparecen en la publicación para que puedas acceder a ellas de forma fácil y cómoda\r\n\r\nEsta publicación periódica nace para cubrir un espacio vital que todos, tanto los pacientes de la enfermedad celíaca como sus familiares o asistentes, desean llenar.

Mantendremos viva una amplia guía donde encontrar los más indicados. Estarán en nuestro debate las bebidas, carnes, arroz, cereales, dulces, golosinas y repostería, frutas, galletas, harinas (panes y bollería), verduras y hortalizas.\r\n\r\nRecetario.- Profusa aportación de menús y consejos. Las mejores recetas de gente con experiencia. Elaboradas por los profesionales más acreditados o por los cocineros/as más anónimos pero que siempre muestran un alto sentido de colaboración.

However, by the broadest definition, the GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus. On the other hand, the digestive system is a broader term that includes other structures, including the digestive organs and their accessories. The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment.\r\n\r\nThe whole digestive tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long.\r\n\r\nDisease\r\n\r\nThere are a number of diseases and conditions affecting the gastrointestinal system, including:\r\n\r\n    Infection. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the intestines. It occurs more frequently than any other disease of the intestines.\r\n    Cancer may occur at any point in the gastrointestinal tract, and includes mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer.\r\n    Inflammatory conditions. Ileitis is an inflammation of the ileum, Colitis is an inflammation of the large intestine.\r\n    Appendicitis is inflammation of the vermiform appendix located at the caecum. This is a potentially fatal condition if left untreated; most cases of appendicitis require surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nDiverticular disease is a condition that is very common in older people in industrialized countries. It usually affects the large intestine but has been known to affect the small intestine as well. Diverticulosis occurs when pouches form on the intestinal wall. Once the pouches become inflamed it is known as diverticulitis.\r\n\r\nInflammatory bowel disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel walls, and includes the subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While Crohn's can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, ulcerative colitis is limited to the large intestine. \r\n\r\nSeveral symptoms are used to indicate problems with the gastrointestinal tract:\r\n\r\n    Vomiting, \r\n    Diarrhoea, \r\n    Constipation, \r\n    Blood in stool, \r\n\r\n\r\nVarious methods of imaging the gastrointestinal tract are used:\r\n\r\n    Radioopaque dyes may be swallowed to produce a Barium swallow\r\n \r\n    An abdominal x-ray may be used to examine the lower gastrointestinal tract.\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n    Celiac Disease\r\n    Cholera\r\n    Diarrhoea\r\n    Enteric duplication cyst\r\n    Giardiasis\r\n    Irritable bowel syndrome\r\n    Pancreatitis\r\n    Peptic ulcer disease\r\n    Yellow Fever\r\n    Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral bacterium.",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables.

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

Otherwise a normal person will not buy from your app bcoz its wasting of money on buying suxh expensive cloths.. And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

Being able to use the app to quickly look up all ingredients without missing anything is awesome. I for one don't have every single ingredient ever made out of animal products memorized as they can be unrecognizable words, so this app is immensely helpful!",

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",
            "This game is overall satisfying but the controls are clunky. I wish that you could decorate your cake but I like this game. And why is this PEGI 18!!!",

It is a type of Italian food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.\r\n\r\nPasta is divided into two broad categories, dried and fresh. Both of them come in a number of shapes and varieties. It is classically served in mainly three types of prepared dishes. Cooked pasta is plated and served with a complimentary side sauce or condiment. The second classification is in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color, and texture. In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but these generally have low micro nutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.\r\n\r\nIngredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt, and water. There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti, and macaroni. Gluten, the protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, and barley, contributes to protein aggregation and firm texture of a normally cooked pasta.

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

If you only have 20 rubies now you have to buy more my grandchildren don't have enough allowance to spend on buying more rubies come on guys think about that because now they need an adult to spend a lot of money on a game.",
            "The statement \" We create levels different in complexity to make the game more interesting and exciting. All levels are tested manually and possible to pass. Boosters and other extra materials of the game you can get in daily gift or buy in store.\" is BS! Who is testing these games? The time levels especially the ice cream levels takes so many tries to beat. The time shouldn't start until the people order shows. The coins should be used for boosters or gems. Addictive but NOT WORTH IT!",
            "This started off very well. But then it was frustrating as the booster were impossible to get and the upgrades were way to expensive. I just wanted to play a game where you do not have to pay to get stuff. This is just not right.",
            "Levels are hard to pass without boosts or added time too soon...they want you to spend money ... just like most of these free cooking games. I enjoy the game and the graphics but I don't enjoy it enough to spend money on it.... time to find a new game again.",
            "This game is insane. I make the food and it wont let me click it to serve it to the customer. Im on level 250 or something. And this just started. Its very frustrating. Very disappointed because i enjoyed this game. Ige checked for updates and have even deleted and re downloaded the game. Still wont work properly."

        "description": "In this app you well know How to Get Rid of Gas, Pains, and Bloating.\r\n\r\nthis app will cover all the details and reasons on why you have stomach gases and suffering from bloating.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Unique Facts About Stomach Gas Bloating ( inside the app you can find more reasons and the best natural cure for bloating and stomach gases ) .\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Suffering from flatulence makes a person's life more difficult. They find it difficult to do a lot of things because the effect of problem flatulence is so considerable that it can make a person so uncomfortable as to find concentration impossible. One of the worst effects of the condition is a sense of stomach gas bloating. The gases are produced by the digestion of food and, instead of travelling downwards via the rectum, sits in the stomach and makes the sufferer feel stuffed. Stomach gas bloating is a major reason for the huge sales of antacids during the holiday season.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Flatulence And Bloating - What Are The Causes?\r\n\r\nOur stomachs are partially filled with acid, which is an important component in the digestion and breaking down of food that we eat. When we eat light food, it is easily broken down and processed. Stomach gas bloating occurs when we eat something that is hard to break down and, while it stays in the stomach, is digested slowly, releasing more gas the longer it is there. This leads to an excess of gas in the stomach, bringing about the swelling of the stomach and the thorny problem of stomach gas bloating.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A sufferer of stomach gas bloating will want to clear the problem by any means necessary. This is why many people, after a heavy meal or a number of fizzy drinks, will force a belch or two in order to ease the strain on their bodies. The problem is that forcing a belch will simply allow more air into the stomach. Belching may well be a major part of releasing flatus - the gas produced by the digestive process - but it needs to be generated by the stomach and the wider digestive system. The balance in the stomach needs to be addressed naturally, in as far is this is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Releasing Flatulence\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of flatus that gathers in the stomach after you have eaten will depend on what it is you have eaten. Obviously, richer more complex foods will take longer to break down, sit in the stomach for longer and therefore produce more flatus. Therefore, to cut down on stomach gas bloating it is essential to stick to a more balanced diet and eat lighter food which will not sit on the stomach as much. Bear in mind that the more decent food you eat, the better the stomach will be able to deal with richer foods when you do eat them, thus cutting down on stomach gas bloating.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. However, sometimes you are going to feel bloated no matter how good you have been, and if this is the case then it is wise to have some tools on hand to ensure stomach gas bloating is dissipated as quickly as possible. This can best be achieved by using antacids. There are many products on the market for indigestion, including some which are effervescent, like Alka-Seltzer. But if your main symptom of indigestion stomach gas bloating, the use of Alka-Seltzer is not a wise choice as this will increase, not diminish the amount of gas in your stomach.",

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."
