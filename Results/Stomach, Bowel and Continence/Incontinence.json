            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

            "Great for those of us who forget we are doing Kegels and lose count! And you can adjust the Kegel sets to your ability. Love how it shows time spent on Kegels per day too. Haven't bought premium yet, but price seems reasonable to get more than one scheduled reminder a day if you're forgetful or don't feel like setting alarms on your phone. Also like the options on vibrate, bell, or no sound when it alternates between squeeze and rest.",
            "Really good for allowing you to personalise your workout and track. Free version is good enough for me, you need to pay to get multiple reminds in the day but 1 is enough. Only thing that would make it better is if it gave guidance in what routine is needed.",
            "I love the app... I've used it for just two weeks...I am pregnant and usually pee on myself while throwing but having used the app for just two weeks,I noticed I haven't peed on myself lately while throwing up. I am giving it 4stars because even after setting the alarm,it doesn't ever notify me, like i missed doing the exercise for two days cos I was busy, assuming I got an alarm,I won't have missed",
            "This is the best kegel app I've found. After trying out a few, I found this is the easiest to use and it gives you gentle reminders on when to exercise (¬£1.99 to have more than 1 reminder a day, but definitely worth it). Perfect for those experiencing the craziness of baby brain and just want something simple, easy and effective.",
            "Great app, which I use to prompt me while doing pelvic floor exercises while pregnant. I like the customisable options such as sound, vibrate and number of holds. Unfortunately the reminder does not seem to work. I have set it for 9pm each day but it never goes off, only goes off when I open the app anyway. Otherwise would be a 5 star worthy app."

            "Excellent app... very easy to use (and my muscles are VERY weak from childbirth injuries and also due to a disease I have.) I found the information and instructions to be very informative. I feel that this is the best PF exercising app available here and would highly recommend it. And having got past the first non-intrusive questionnaire bit there are no adverts either, which is good. I highly recommend anyone to give this a go... (and I only write reviews for an app that impresses me ü§î‚ò∫üòä)",
            "I love the app, it is done in a great detail and with a lot of effort. The instructions are nice and i love the explanations of how to find the right muscles (e.g. analogy with the zipper). The categorization of contractions also helps to implement them easier in every day life (it is not just simple kegels). Only thing regarding the questionnaire (not relevant for me but the developers) is that i could not identify myself with any of the options given for why i am using the app",
            "The instructions are easy to follow, the strength scale is easy to follow and the reminders are easy to follow. And my problem is starting to get under control so I don't feel unease just for lifting my kid. Looking forward to completing the 3 months. I got this app as a suggestion from my midwife after suffering a rather extensive damage while giving birth. I could not figure out the instructions I got, via letter, by a physical therapist, and she came up with this.",
            "Have tried a few pelvic floor exercise apps and this one is really good. No ads, no pressuring you to buy electronic aids to help you do your exercises. Advice as and when to do exercises and how to do them correctly. Would definitely recommend this app, and it's Free!!!",
            "I got a recommendation to use the app by my physiotherapist, because I have a large injury in my pelvic floor (levator avulsion). The sound does not alway play correctly. The most disturbing is that old lady though. This is mocking all of us having injuries from giving birth. Most physiotherapists in Sweden recommend this app for these injuries we are certainly quite a few young women using this. Please change the background!(or give us an option!)"

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

In these sessions, the progress or status of your treatment is monitored and you will be given special exercises to help increase bladder capacity or strengthen the muscles needed to achieve dry nights.<br>Alongside the online program, we have included FAQs, so that all questions and issues that one could face during a bedwetting treatment are clearly answered by our video clips. Of course, should you have a question not covered in the video section, we are more than happy to consult by email or phone.",

However I don't like it when I am working on a level and finish the task, close the app, and when I go back to the app later it puts me back at level 1 even though I'm working on level 4 or 7. The app needs to remember the level I'm working on and go directly to that level. And it's not clear how many repetitions you are to do.",

            "GREAT APP!!! I downloaded three Kegel apps for testing and evaluation to ascertain which would suit my needs. After a week, this was by far the best. Good user customized exercise intervals with preset times and adjustable sets. Since using it for some six weeks, it has greatly improved my health where Kegel exercises are concerned. I highly recommend it for your Kegel exercise needs for both men and women.",
            "This is the best app I have found to support doing pelvic floor exercises. Enough flexibility for me to choose exactly what I need in the settings with the duration and the number of reps etc. Only thing missing is the option to have accompanying music, however you can have spotify going at the same time.",
            "I really like this app! Have had pelvic floor pain, go to pf phys therapy. simple reminders that pop up on your screen on the icon and that you could vary the different sets you need to do. I told my physical therapist about it, shes spreading the word also about this app. You can also vary the counting by vibe, belltone, or spoken. Vibe count is best for me. thank you",
            "The best Kegel exercise app I found so far. After using for just one week I contributed and removed ads which I never even noticed anyhow, but wanted to support the app. Nice, clean easy to use interface and reminders. Everything is totally and quickly customizable.",
            "Simple interface, streamlined features, and uncluttered appearance. The only way I could see the app improving would be a way to customize color options. An all-around near perfect app."

I do like the time challenge as it challenges you to wake tha fk up and release even as your target moves and also creates distance shots, so there are benefits of the slower upgrade that requires certain accomplishments and seeks to financially profit. However there are other games very similar. I am concerned with a person get bored."

        "description": "T√§t¬ÆIII is intended to support men with pelvic floor exercises in cases where these kinds of exercises have been recommended by medical staff.  Urine leakage upon coughing, jumping or sneezing ‚Äì stress incontinence ‚Äì is common after an operation for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy). It is recommended that pelvic floor exercises start before the operation is performed, and that the exercises continue after the operation. \r\n\r\nThe T√§t¬ÆIII app provides a pelvic floor muscle training programme in six basic and six advanced levels, with increasing severity. Four different kinds of ‚Äúcontractions‚Äù are described. The app includes visual aids for each level of training, a statistics function and the ability to create reminders.

        "descriptionHTML": "T√§t¬ÆIII is intended to support men with pelvic floor exercises in cases where these kinds of exercises have been recommended by medical staff.  Urine leakage upon coughing, jumping or sneezing ‚Äì stress incontinence ‚Äì is common after an operation for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy). It is recommended that pelvic floor exercises start before the operation is performed, and that the exercises continue after the operation. <br><br>The T√§t¬ÆIII app provides a pelvic floor muscle training programme in six basic and six advanced levels, with increasing severity. Four different kinds of ‚Äúcontractions‚Äù are described. The app includes visual aids for each level of training, a statistics function and the ability to create reminders.

            "A simple app that does more or less what it promises. Could easily be made better and more useful with some simple additions / modifications: 1. Instead of a special note entry (or in addition to it), make it possible to add a comment (or note) to each event (intake, voiding a.s.o.). 2. Let people change the standard intake measures to something that suits them better (add a \"settings\" part for this and maybe other defaults) 3. (As another user suggested) add a running total functionality for both intake and voiding. 4. I didn't find any use for the distinction of 48 and 72. You start when you want and end when you want. 5. Report: Remove the unnecessary \"ml\" near every entry (we know its not liters), and make it more useful in Excel.",

        "description": "The Kegel Exercise (also referred to as the Pelvic Floor Exercise) is the action of repetitive contraction of the pubococcygeus (P.C.) muscles. If you‚Äôve ever stopped yourself from urinating midstream, you‚Äôve used your PC muscles. If you flex your PC muscles and hold them in a contracted position for ten seconds through a series of reps you are then partaking in the Kegel exercise. Originally used for women to control incontinence (the urge to urinate all the time) and to enhance sexual responses during intercourse, the Kegel Exercise is now also being used by men.\r\n\r\nHow to do Kegel Exercises\r\nLocate the right muscles\r\nInsert a finger inside your anus and squeeze the surrounding muscles. You can feel the PC muscle tighten or move upward when you contract it. Then, relax your muscles and feel your pelvic floor return to the starting position.\r\n\r\nAlso try to stop the flow of urine when you urinate. Don‚Äôt do this on an extremely full bladder.\r\nPractice Makes Perfect\r\nContract your pelvic floor muscles, hold the contraction for five seconds, and then relax for five seconds. Practice it five to six times in a row. Work up to keeping the muscles contracted for ten seconds at a time, and then relax for another ten seconds between each contraction.\r\nFocus While Exercising\r\nTo have a faster result in a shorter period of time, focus your mind on tightening your pelvic floor muscles only. Do not flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs or buttocks. Breathe normally and avoid holding your breath.\r\nRepeat 3 times a day\r\nPractice at least three sets of ten repetitions a day. After a while, you‚Äôll be able to exercise your PC muscles seamlessly. You‚Äôll even be able to do them while doing your daily chores!\r\nThe Kegel exercise has been shown to promote vast improvement in the health of the penis. In excess, however, the exercise can also be very harmful. The reason for this is because over-contraction of the prostate muscle triggers the prostate's sympathetic nerve to induce an ejaculation. Never perform the Kegel with an extremely full bladder. Overworking the PC muscle for a long period of time would weaken it and result in premature ejaculation or seminal leakage.\r\n \r\nPeople with weak prostates or exhausted prostate should be taking prostate care formula with Kegel to have a better ejaculation control results. Weakened bladders can be strengthened with herbs for bladder, which improves bladder elasticity.",

            "Quality companion app to your Bloom Method membership! Easy to use and find the class for you, and Chromecast support works seamlessly! I started the Bloom Method early on in my pregnancy and am so glad that high quality prenatal classes and support exist purely online these days. I've tried a couple other online prenatal programs and can honestly say that the Bloom Method is the best! The quality of the instruction is high - they provide multiple explanations and ways of thinking about the core techniques. I've been able to use the techniques throughout my days and in other fitness classes as well, and so far have had a very easy, healthy pregnancy! I highly recommend the Bloom Method!",
            "I was an avid fitness junkie before I was pregnant, and continued through my first two trimesters with my normal workout routine. But as I shifted into my third trimester, my regular workouts were not cutting it, and while researching mama-friendly workouts stumbled upon Studio Bloom. I started with the foundations videos the first week of my third trimester and have continued it through my postpartum period, and have not looked back once! I cannot say enough how much more confident and strong I felt going into my birth, as well as how prepared I felt to tackle recovery afterwards. I have a deeper understanding of my pelvic floor and core than I ever have and it is completely thanks to Studio Bloom. There are a variety of workout types, calendars and programs you can choose from, and feel tailored to you as a mama in that moment. Also, there is a Facebook community of members who are supportive and willing to answer questions anytime you feel stuck - workout related or not!",
            "Love this program! It's so important to learn how to breath and properly engage the core and these ladies are amazing at teaching us how to do that. I did these workouts throughout my pregnancy and believe this is how I healed so well after my delivery. Can't wait to continue on in postpartum.",
            "I love Studio Bloom! They have been essential in my prenatal exercise regimine and postpartum recovery. I used their program for my third pregnancy and notice a world of difference with my strength during my pregnancy, during labor and now two weeks into recovery.

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. üòä",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

But after the redownload it's doing better, despite my more rural area, which is nice. Likely reupdate this after I've used it longer.",
            "This app constantly nudges you like Google to activate not only normal GPS based location but \"high accuracy\" location service which only means all your location data then go to Google. Read the fineprint. I don't want this and it's absolutely not necessary for this or any other app, just easier to implement because Google wants it that way. You said 1 month ago you are going to fix this asap! Nothing happened. Beside that it showed only a few toilets in Austria. 100km away. Quite useless.",
            "I was disappointed with this app. I know that it takes a community effort for apps like this to succeed but after calling upon it more than a handful of times, and not once seeing a bathroom indicated, it's become obvious that my community sees value in keeping its lavatory locations secret, and so I will keep with this tradition. Unfortunately this does not bode well for this app.",
            "Works well for me. Could do with more community input. I think the initial set of toilets must come from a database. Accurate but no information on most of them (cost/condition etc).",
            "Very good for travelling around with, shame some toilets are closed out of peak season & of course due to covid many establishments think it better to close toilets so people can't go or have to use a Bush. No fault of the app but in current times it pays to keep your options open."

Also under the OVERVIEW TOTALS, and possibly elsewhere if that total is pulled, mine states 68 total entries, 49 days with multiple entries. However I have only used the app for 18 days. That 49 days with multiple entries result is incorrect.",

I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",

            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

I'm considering buying the lifetime plan hoping this app doesn't get discontinued.",

Also a go-to feature where you can find specific entries besides the filter would help. Also it would be nice to be able to save community blogs and daily quotes that inspired you. Maybe save them somewhere so you can access them any time. I also have experienced difficulty downloading the pdf versions of my entries."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your usersüñï",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

            "I love this app it tells me what day i should start and I've done that each time. My only issue was this last period lasted 13 days and i had to restart my period twice even tho I hadn't selected that my period had ended yet, there should be a way to fix that so you don't have to restart and make notes. My other thing was when you say you've been intimate you have 3 positions to choose from but it only let's you choose one, could you please fix that also? Other than that I've been very satisfied",
            "Overall has been a hugely helpful app. My one beef is if I'm trying to remove the pregnancy setting and accidentally choose \"miscarriage\" as the reason I can't go back and fix it. There is no setting to remove the miscarriage note, which affects the app's ability to continue predicting my fertility cycle. I would like to be able to remove pregnancy notes, please and thank you.",
            "I have this app with my partner, her app works well. My app runs in 'partner mode' and hasn't updated in a long time. According to my app she is 145 days late, as she is not 4 months pregnant I believe the app may be malfunctioning. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, this has not helped. The settings button on the interface is unresponsive. Great idea for an app, poor final product.",
            "I enjoy the free portion of the app but recently my widget has stopped working. I checked for and update but there isnt one. I have to delete the widget and replace it everyday to fix it and it defeats the purpose of me using the widget. The widget worked fine the first month or so. The app seems to keep everything together well and I would upgrade for the charts but I would prefer a cheaper subscription for just the charts only. Thanks for the app! I hope the widget issue is fixed soon.",
            "This app helps a lot to keep track. I don't have to try to remember when I'm going to start, when my last menstrual started, helps when I'm going to ovulate and many other things. I would give 5 stars if the app was still completely free."

            "Wonderful, wonderful app. Only two complaints that they might be working on fixing. One, it doesn't tell you how much you should be at currently, it just shows consumption, total, and then a little arrow at your current objective. Would be nice to see your current objective number of ounces. Second, the logging for type of drink is a little clunky. Would be nice to hold down the 'plus' button, and then drag my finger to the choice. I press the plus button all the time with the wrong drink.",
            "An excellent app. Hypothetically my kidneys owe to this app. In the last 1.5 yrs, whatever water I drank, I can clearly attribute 80% of that success to this app. I forget drinking water. Even after working whole day and running 3 KMs later, I don't feel thirsty. Though I don't feel like drinking but my body clearly shows me that it is not happy by the color of waste that comes out. Since using this app, I have changed that. There is only so much an app can do. Rest is in our own hands.",
            "It's an alright app. Does what it says on the tin. The thing is it says it shares your data with other sites for ads and promotions but you can turn that off if you want. I've tried turning it off 4 times but it doesn't work. You can click \"I do not agree\" but it just puts it back to agree. Can this be fixed?",
            "Fantastic reminder! It's very simple and easy to use. I love that I can change the amount of ounces and the time that I need to be reminded. Very user-friendly! Since using this app has done a great job of keeping up with my intake of water as I begin the process of losing weight. If I have a headache I simply drink enough water in that headache goes away. It's kept me from being dehydrated. I love it!",
            "I would love it, if it actually did it's job. It reminds me to drink water for about 2 days then just stops sending notifications all together. I have to open the app and add water for it to start reminding me again. But it inevitably stops after a day. I regret purchasing this app, and will look for another. Also, it does NOT allow me to add water from my watch."

            "I was about to spend money and time printing & laminating yet another chart for my kids, but instead, I found this app which made things so much easier! My 2 year old was in school before quarantine & potty training well but we still needed help with consistency. This app had her excited to go from the first day of use and we are now on our 4th day in a row exclusively in big girl panties with very few accidents. The small $ was worth it to have other caregivers track progress too. We love it!",
            "I think this app is really great. We are only on day one of training but the timer has been nice to have. I also like the tracking of if she does poop or pee and what times. I think it will be helpful to anticipate future potty trips.",
            "It has all the basics...you can track input, output, attempts, and dry pants. The timer is fantastic! Very easy to use. I just wish there were more options for a reward screen for successes. I have the free version, but would upgrade if that were an option.",
            "This app has been the best app out of all of them that my husband and I have downloaded. It's actually helped our son with potty training! We've never been as successful as we have been lately! He actually gets excited to go on the \"poppy\" because he knows if he does he will get the fireworks and stars that the app does after every potty!",
            "My child loves the fireworks, which is a plus. But its an \"either/or\" app, which stinks because I dont want to mark individually of they were dry, sat, and/or peed, it takes too much time for our busy schedule. It'd be really nice if I could mark that they were both dry AND sat on the potty as the same 'activity'."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Really Nice... and Cool Features... but for a Price I was excited to start using this app. There have been many times where I get ideas for art projects, and experience feelings that can only be described in the given moment. It's easy to add entries and do quick check-ins multiple times a day and I was psyched to see the other journaling ideas... Until I saw that you have to spend $30/year for those features. So cruel to ad them just to say, \"Pay us! Minus that, I would give it 5 stars.",
            "The app has more intelligent offer than I expected. First, it is a great interface to use on any devices, web, phone, tablet so I'm happy to be able to access it any time. The note is simply minimal and well organized. I'm surprised that there are actually promt checkins and guided templates for different topics for journaling. I'm using more than I intended.",
            "So far so good very simple to use and the design and layout is appealing. Better than most I've tried recently. Option to upload multiple photos in one go rather than individually would be handy, and the ability to upload videos would be nice. Great experience so far though.",
            "it is a really good app, ive only just started using it and is very good compared to other diarys and mood journals ive had in the past. it is good even without the subscription as you have access to the diary feature, mood board and everything. the only reason im giving 4 stars is because i feel that the mood board could be a bit more in depth that just, \"pick a face, what activities made you feel this way, any other notes.\" i feel it needs a little more but it is a great app and i recomend it!",
            "Pay to use... Listen, If you guy offer this for free with a very LIGHT ad presence so you can get paid for the work out into creating this app, fine. If you want to offer the option to pay like 1 or 2 dollars to get rid of the ads, fine. Even if you roll out new amazing content, I mean serious content that you can't find elsewhere, not fonts, themes, backgrounds, photo insertion or that simple bs. But telling me to pay over $5 monthly when I can buy a $1 notebook? No, that is money grubbing."

When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",

I also love the water tracker app. I sometimes go a day without drinking water but with this app, im pretty sure im gonna drink a lot of water and stay hydrated. Hopefully i won't have much migraines. Weldone",

Though my height haven't increased yet I do this daily because exercising everyday is good for health. I hope that my height would increase some day as it depends on each one's body hormones. I have some suggestions for your app. You could add some yogas, some music, the tips of the process of inhalation & exhalation in every exercise. üòò",

It's very helpful app. But the reason of giving it 4 stars is that in diet ,it includes lot many non veg things which I hate üò†üò° actually. You should ask this thing in introduction before planning when you ask about age ,height, etc. It will be better if you do this change. Plzz ,accept my request and do make change.",
            "Amazing i think it is going to be a good trainer and animated images and videos are also given in it. It not only tells about exercise but also about nutrition plus sleep and every exercises are increase and daily new tips of nutrition is also given with it. I think it will increase my height and the further after2 months i will post about it but i liked the app very muchüòòüòò",

            "Really good app. It needs way more event options, like Fell Asleep, Woke Up, Played, Walked, Trained, Swam, Bathed, etc. But I totally love that events can be back-dated, because when my pup goes potty or has an accident, I'm more interested in using it as a training opportunity than reaching for my phone to press a button. Most of my clothes don't have pockets, so half the time when I'm taking him on walks I don't even have my phone with me.",
            "At first I was too lazy to use this, but after a bad day of several accidents I started inputting the data. It was pretty easy actually...just whip out the phone (put the treats, clicker, and poop bags in your other pocket) and press one button! It gives you a good reference for your dog's patterns. Definitely a useful app! Edit: 2 wks later App has become more & more useful. The app (and consequently you) gets better at suggesting times and accidents. Definitely helped us!",
            "Great tracker for housetraining (and beyond)! With an entire family taking turns with a puppy this is a GREAT app for tracking potty, pee, feeding, water, and accidents. It has greatly helped in training for frequent pee trips that happen from 90 to longer stretches of time. It even helped us establish a poop pattern twice a day, 12 hours apart. And with everyone posting feeding we can keep the puppy on a regular schedule. Our 18 week old puppy has us trained really well with this log!",
            "What it's missing is a way to record when we take the dog out. I want to see if there's a pattern there, when she's peeing in the house vs when we take her out. Our log looks like all red exclamation marks even though we take her out a bazillion times a day, she refuses to pee outside. It's a little helpful knowing WHEN she pees (ALL DAY LONG) but would be way more helpful if it showed when we took her out too.",
            "Intuitive, easy to use and a life (or carpet) saver. Given this app is completely free and doesn't even contain ads, I'm thoroughly impressed. I'm only using it as an approximate tracker to see how many and roughly when poops occur, but it has been pivotal in our pup's toilet training. Definitely recommend to anyone who takes their puppies wellbeing seriously."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I love the premise, but in practice it doesn't serve my needs. If I forget to log a pee, there is no way to go back and enter it, I can only restart the timer from the point that I remembered. I think for some people this will serve them really well, but unfortunately I am uninstalling and just using an app that allows for back entries. I'll set my own timer.",
            "I like that the timer reminds you it's potty time. However, there should be more options to choose from. For instance \"sitting on potty\" and whether or not \"successful/unsuccessful\". Also there should be a log keeping track of the unsuccessful and successful times. And the design really doesn't matter so much, but it would be more pleasant to view if some effort was put into it. Honestly I'm grateful but to help out other parents and myself as a parent, can you please update the app? Thanks.",
            "My main hang up is not being able to customize the alert song. If there is a way I have not clue how to do it. Other than that it's working pretty good. The kids know when it goes off they have to sit on the potty.",

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user ü•≤",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "I absolutely LOVE this app I use it every single day, it's gotten to the point where if we're having a really busy day I definitely rely on the app to tell me when it's time for a bottle or diaper, I love that it gives you a timeline and that you can adjust and tweak everything down to the minute but also the app is very easy to navigate. Fantastic app and I've already recommended it to my other expecting mom friends!",
            "just found this app and after some testing it seems very nice & super easy to use BUT with no ability to sync data between the two parents (or even two devices). I'm impressed with the \"dad\" setting but what's the use of it if it doesn't sync with the \"mom\" in order to know what's my next action, let's say? is this a paid option or.. am I blind? overall seems a well-designed and pretty easy to use, app!",
            "Does exactly what I need: lets me easily log feeds as I'm doing them, including which breast I'm feeding from. Really helpful with the diapering as well- allows you to just log what's in the nappy (pee, poo or both) but with the option to add comments about the diapers as well. It's very simple to use and the summary displays are helpful for keeping track of what's happening. I'm a first time mum, and it helps keep my anxiety low to have an accurate record of what is going in and out!",
            "So easy to use. Makes tracking a breeze especially when you're half asleep at 3am feeding. The edit feature is also great if you forget to log off. Love that you can add in photos and chart growth/ sleeping patterns. The only improvement I can think of would be a pause button when feeding. I highly recommend this free app!.",
            "This app has been a life saver. As a mum to multiple children my mummy brain has kicked in and I can't remember when I last did anything or which side I last fed on. With this app I'm able to check in seconds when something was last done and its suprising how often I think its only been an hour and its actually been several hours. I'm also able to monitor his general health and it gives me peace of mind. Its a very well made app, very useful and simple enough to use. Thank you."

            "H meave been using this diary for a long time. It's excellent! But I'm finding many of the photos I added appear as duplicates. Very annoying having to delete and add them again. Why is this happening? It seems random. Can anyone explain why this is happening. Duplicate photos only appearing on my phone, the computer version is always perfect.",
            "I was more of a pen and paper type, which I still do on occasion but I love the fact I can ad photos and that will autoadjust the location of my entry to match the photo so I can show and speak to the moment. I can also journal on my driving commute which is always where I'm unloading the days thoughts and feel inspired. It's so easy and will always be able to be found.",
            "I tried to export the journal to a new email account; exportation is only supported with a premium account. So I signed up for a 7-day trial with auto-renewal in order to export my journal... but was unable to import the journal into the new email account. Now frustrated, I tried to turn off the auto-renewal so I wouldn't be charged for a functionality that didn't work. No dice. The link provided in the help desk was 404-ed, the link provided in the desktop app didn't work. In short, fraudulent.",
            "I love this app. So nice that I can add pics, audios, videos, links to my entries. It's so personal and meaningful. I wish it hadn't deleted some of my videos though. They were working and now it shows the entry is empty. Overall, best app I've found.",
            "At first I loved the app and made entries daily. Then all of sudden a question pops up in my head, \"what if the developers reads these daily enteries\". I never felt right since. I purchased the membership but I dont feel I have 100% privacy."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. üòÄ",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ‚ù§"

            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 √©nergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Like if your like me, you don't mind the ads, but my problem is that I heal the same patients over and again when I come back into the game. But good game overall. I really like your game Pepi Wonder World.",

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could üòéüòé",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. üòï Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yesü§û"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ‚ù§ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh. You can pay to read them more often, even though the comics again were ENTIRELY FREE BEFORE. You wanna read a 70 chapter story? You have to do it over 70 days, unless you wanna pay.",
            "I love the contents of this app, but I can't ignore the constant glitches. One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media playerüòü Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

This took me 4 hours to download litteraly 1 percent every 2 minutes, then i get the worst possible experience of my life. Also, ads every single level and usually i instantly die because theres 6 wheel spikes at the very beginning not timed right to be possible. I dont care what you do to this game, im never playing it again.",

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zanyüëåüëåüòé",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ‚≠ê‚≠ê. Best of luck for your game. üòä. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

I would have given 5 stars until the addition of the intrusive advertisements. Most of the ads are full screen, come with a timer and can't be closed. I don't have time to deal with those annoying ads with a newborn in my arms. The developers should consider adding a paid version without ads. I would gladly pay for it.",

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!üò°",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

            "Constantly crashing...... this app would allow you the odd video for a booster or extra few moves, but every video link crashes the app which means you lose where you were, and can't progress anywhere. I get the whole idea is to encourage you to buy etc, but the app should still function. Really tempted to just give up. Shame, had been a good boredom buster up to this point.",
            "Candy Crush Soda Saga is the best and fun game i've ever played...it has so so many levels that you can play...some are hard and some are easy to play...i really never thought that i could play this game as i'm playing it now..level 920 isthe hardest level in the game but is fun to play it again and again...",
            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications üò∂I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand üòê cause of the translator. Please fix these issues üôÇ",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.üò£ everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by thisüòê"

            "Would give it 5 star but seriously after every turn there is an add.. It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",
            "30 second ads, 20 second gameplay, rinse, repeat. Greedy ad revenue grab by developer. Hey developers, are you listening? It's actually faster to play the game, start an ad, force quit the game and restart the game. That's faster than watching an ad every single time.",
            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ‚òπÔ∏è Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping ü§£ its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day üòÇ The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more üëå",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off ü§£. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "This used to be my favorite game, now I downloaded it again and I'm just disappointed, there is no story mode, you can only go a limit in every round till you finish the mission , and where did the story's go , and the record breaking games, and what happend to competitions, and the super silly fun land with the rollercoaster, I'm just disappointed, I hope you can fix it and undo the last 10 updates, and go back to the original game, cuz this one sucks. Very sadly uninstalling.ü•∫üò©",
            "Game is enjoyable but once you complete all the levels you can't progress further. Also there should be a proper character categorisation . There are only 3 types of characters; common ,rare and epic. But some characters can be found by special missions . So they should be categorised under legendary or exclusive . Further there should be new rooms and new powerups for minions.",
            "I have given up trying to play it. 5 updates later and still no resolution to my loading issues, and I see from other comments I am not alone. Shame as otherwise it was for me one of the best games. Edit: thank you for your answer but it still doesn't work. Not sure of my Player ID as I can't get into the game, after the initial video it gets stuck on downloading 0mb of 0mb ü§∑üèΩ",
            "great game but wow ive had problems. they have this new update and now i cant play anymore it just says downloading. for a week. i contacted help got a ticket but no fix. and then years ago i played this spent a ton of money but my progress wasnt saved. now it says i should be able to get my current progress back thru fb but i have my doubts since I cant even get into the game at all. so great game but dont play. edit: weeks later and still nothing from help customer assistance. Edit: better now",
            "Honestly, im rating this game 4 stars, all the progress i made in the good ole days of Minion Rush in the Story Mode was lost, and i genuinly miss that satisfaction of passing levels and seeing that a new part of the lab gets made and unlocked by filling up the containers with jelly, honestly, its easier to get minions now compared to before and currency is WAY easier to obtain compared to before, all that its missing for me is that story mode it had before, but still, this is a great game!"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. üßöüåºüëºüëº. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too. I was in search of such game these days I keep downloading games and after 1hr or so I delete them I am never satisfied with games but this game is so amazing. üòòü§©ü§©"

            "One of the best mobile games I've ever played, not even including the fact that I have almost every single ubisoft game, but this is the first mobile ubisoft game I have actually liked. There are some things that could be better, like the death animations and the kill animations, but other than that it's an amazing game, 11/10 would recommend.",
            "It's really great! I've been playing this game for a while now and it always entertains me. Would've given it five stars but there's a problem. The game crashes when my shark dies and then when I reopen it, I don't get the gold or exp I had earned. It doesn't happen always, but the crashing rates have increased. Please fix it... It's hard to play 10mins in one round and then earning nothing at all. Thank you.",
            "This game is super awsome! But just one thing about it: The larger sized sharks. Once you get near one you pretty much can't escape unless you have a lot of stamina. And once you die from them and press the \"Save me!\" button you have almost no time to swim away, and then they bite you once and you're almost dead. I just think you need to give an 8 second head-start before the larger sharks can catch you.",
            "This game is so freaking awesome!!! However, the control system could use a ln addative, a joystick option that keeps the joystick in a fixed place down in the left hand corner, oh and the health drain is ridiculous! Health shouldn't drop that rapidly, you should maybe.... fix that, please? Other than that? GREAT game!",
            "This game is amazing. No pay to win. Great amount of skippable ads. You eventually get every shark from grinding enough. I just grinded out 280 gems and bought the Robo-Shark. Great time killer. Especially without Wi-Fi :P Get this game it's so worth it. Ubisoft, this game is amazing and almost perfect. Just a bit of tweaking and this game is number one. Great job!"

I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",

It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",

I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S.

            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

Your backed into a corner.....stay away from it ! If your card is declined by their system your screwed unless you have another card There is no option to back out. Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",

After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

        "description": "Constipation is a disorder of the digestive tract. When you suffer from constipation your bowels don't regularly move or they are not emptied completely. Unfortunately constipation can cause many diseases because this disorder produces many toxins and these can reach in the blood stream and in this way they are carried in all your body.\r\n\r\nPeople of all ages can suffer from constipation taking into account that it is one of the most common digestive disorders. Most of the time this disorder is just temporary and it can be treated very easy. A great attention must be paid to the chronic constipation. It must be not neglected because it can lead to hemorrhoids, fecal impaction, piles, fecal incontinence, and anal fissures.\r\n\r\nFortunately this digestive disorder can be treated very easy. More on, there are lots of natural treatments that can help you to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n\r\nConstipation has many symptoms: from difficulty, infrequency or irregularity in elimination of hard fecal matter, foul breath, loss of appetite, coated tongue, dizziness, headache, dark circles under the eyes to dark circles under the eyes, depression, ulcer in mouth, varicose veins, acidity, insomnia, pain in the lumbar region, constant fullness in the abdomen and varicose veins.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nThe main causes of constipation are a fault style of life and a fault diet. Stress can be a cause, too.\r\n\r\nNatural Treatments\r\n\r\nMost of the fruits except jack fruit and banana are very useful in constipation treatments. Of course some are more effective than others. For example Bael fruit is considered the best natural laxative. But there are many other fruits that can help you to treat this digestive disorder as well.\r\n\r\nPears are very beneficial to treat constipation. If you eat a pear during your breakfast or after dinner, its effects will be surprising.\r\n\r\nGuava is another natural remedy. If you eat it with seeds, it provides your diet roughage. Eat one or two guavas every day and you will not suffer from constipation anymore.\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that they are very tasty, grapes are a merciless enemy of constipation.\r\n\r\nGrapes contain sugar, organic acid and cellulose and this combination make them to be a great natural laxative. Besides the fact that they clear the bowels they also tone up intestines and the stomach. Eat at least 350 gm of grapes daily.\r\n\r\nOranges can help you, too. Eat one or two oranges at dinner and at breakfast and the problem is resoled. Figs and papaya are very useful, too. You can also treat your constipation with spinach. Squeeze half of a lime in a glass of hot water and mix it with 5 gm of salt. You can also swallow a teaspoon of linseed with a glass of water before your meals. Drinking a glass of water in which you put a teaspoon of honey is another way to get rid of constipation. Drink teas made from herbal known as good laxatives. Drink horse gowan tea for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will help you not to suffer from constipation.",

You can also skip the advertisement by simply clicking the collect button which will not triple the rewards. You enjoy the game as you pass the levels."

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.üòäüòÅ Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this itüôèüèΩ",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I‚ô•PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",
            "I LOVE IT! omg i love the mini games, i'll say, THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! so many things that you can do omg i love everything in this game! specially the events, even the ads bothering me, it's okay. thank you outfit7! i'm looking forward for the future updates! (more activities and games please! thank you so much) üòªü§ç",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry üò≠üò°üò°üëøüë∫üòæ",

And the juice that we made is tooooooooooooo good!! And the mini games in it.. I just love to play space trails in it!!

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, üòú you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "The Game is very nice. My Younger Brother loves it a lot. But the only problem is that --What kind of school is that in which there is no education , only photo clipping , playing and eating. Is that how a kinder garden runs ?Well , I know it is a baby game and that is a kinder-garden. All objects are fine but there should be a bit of Baby Study. That's all I wanted to say . Thank you . And please fix the game as I told . Thus baby will get entairtent as well as they will learn some Study also.",
            "I love the way Baby Bus apps have back to back 30 second forced adverts that my 2 year old gets to watch. No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE. Update: just uninstalled all your apps because they make my kid rage when they are unable to play the game because stuck on adds and in non google store app install screens. just a shame you guys can't put yourself in the shoes of a child.",
            "I like it but there should be more things at the kindergarden like a playground , study, and thus if they get hurt there should be a nurse's office .anyway I like this game üëçhope you make more gamesüòÑ. That is all I wanted to say bye.",
            "Well it's good but it is not that educational for kids 1-6 years who are playing this, they need to learn not play. In this game they are just picking animals up and not taking them to, you know, KINDERGARTEN. Please fix your game it needs to be a bit educational, when I ment by educational, what I mean is they need to learn a bit and some babyish education",
            "I love thos game it is educating for children. an if you only have one baby bus game then...you should really install more cause the baby bus brand is now a best seller well i think. but in my book it would be the 2cnd best seller an you should really install not just this game but many more games from baby bus many more.an i hope you take my advice but anyways have a nice day or night when ever your reading my feedback."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "It's simple and easy to use. You can choose how often it reminds you to drink water (30min, 1hr, 2hrs) and a time frame so it won't disturb you overnight. When you add water, you choose how many ounces you drank by scrolling for or typing in the #. My favorite part is this horizonal bar & a face that lets you know how you're doing throughout the day. So you can see if you're falling behind. 5 stars all the way!",
            "OMG... This is one of the best water drinking reminder app ever. You can just enter your weight and it will tell you how much water you need to consume a day.It gives you reminders according to your wakeup time and bedtime. You can also customize this. It gives you reminders between the time that you want. Like, you can choose 1 or 2 hrs. Easy.... Really loved this app and will definitely recommend it to you.",
            "This app is the best. It has everything I was looking for a very long time. It let's me pick how much water I want do drink in a day and keeps a graph of how much water I've drank in a week. It gives simple reminders and best of all it's all FREE!",
            "It really helps me know how much I'm drinking and reminds me I gotta drink more. Its an amazing app that's really helped me. Because I forget to drink and since had this app I haven't really forgotten I love it. Thank you for making such a great useful app. üòäüòäüòä",
            "This water tracker is sorta easy to figure out, but some popup tips the first time would be good so user doesn't have to spend the effort figuring out how to enter drinks, correct entries, and add entries. I am glad I can do the second and third of those actions , but they weren't obvious."

            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOODüëç!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! üòÆ add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. üòÄüòÉüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç......"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen üëëeven when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up üëçüëç",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. üëç I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. üòÅ",

            "I give it a 1, just because I have to for the review. But this is UNPLAYABLE. So many stupid ads, and right now I'm stuck on one about mattress and no matter what I do, it pops up and I can't close it, even restarting the app. This game use to be amazing and fun, until it jumped to the Ads hell, now it is a waste of time and space...",
            "I get kicked off the app EVERY time I try to play the upside down games & also when I have to replay a level. It's annoying having to open the app every time and I can't get more than 81 ducks to move up to the next stage. IMO the original Swampy is better but I've finished it. The graphics are not as good either. The only thing I like is combining Swampy, Cranky and Allie games with different levels. Going to uninstall if it's not fixed soon",
            "I played the game without wifi so I wouldn't get too many ads also for it to function and it worked very well. Later it needed me to watch videos to proceed so I switched on my wifi. It started malfunctioning and ads popped up every 3 seconds. Eventually it stopped working. When I went back into the app I found all my progress gone. I tried playing again but when I exited the app it restarted again. I think it is a great app. I had fun. I hope other people don't have the same problem",
            "The game has alot of ads, more than anyone can expect, and bow i reached a level which cant be started without an ad that cant be closed, there is no option to close the ad after it finish and i had to close the game totally and start it again to see the same ad with no option to close it after it finish, not playable anymore, uninstalling it.",
            "This game is wonderful i really like it ,for those who hate it,maybe you're wrong. You have to wait patiently,and i install it and it's playable. There are no ads if you don't use wi-fi,even if i use it,the ads are so a little."

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "I'd recommend a way to disconnect the headphones from the app, or maybe see what your headset is connected to, or set priority of connection. Often I connect to my pc and phone. Use the connection to my pc all day then want to watch netflix on my phone in bed. Guess what, pc is still in control, but you can't kill the connection from the app, so I have to run down to my desktop or I can't hear my phone.",
            "I just bought the Evolve 75e product. Not sure why it isn't supported on this app. Would be nice if it would be so I could update firmware and manage my device. The product is great, great sound and easy to setup and use. Update: In the app if you don't connect a device you can't get into the about section of the app, or at least I am not seeing any way to get to about.",
            "After rocking the Active 65t I bought the 75t this summer. Love them, and since a week there's Active Noise Cancelation too! The app is great and has improved massively, less crashes and like every other earphone maker should have: an equalizer! One thing I'd like to suggest: There are a few default \"Moments\", like My Moments, Commute and Focus. I'd like to be able to have different ANC profile and attach them to the different Moments. In my home the noise is different from the noise in my car, so is it possible to add custom ANC profiles to the different Moments? That would be awesome! Keep up the great work! That's why I didn't switch to other headphones/earbuds ;-)",
            "Jabra Elite 85h: Connection was very easy and fast. The app has a neat and tidy design. All options are easily accessible and understandable. The EQ works well and I love the option to be able to turn off the Voice-Playback when changing modes. I haven't experienced any problems so far. Will update this review if and when necessary.",
            "Since the last update when I open the app is stuck on the \"choose your headset from the list\" screen. I choose my headset (75t) and go to Bluetooth settings (where they are already paired). I close the app and open again and im back on the menu to choose headset with no way back to the welcome page. Iv tried reinstalling and repairing. Tried with my second phone with no issues."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! üç∞üç©üçÆ",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more üí∞. Please fix those things üôèüôè. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week.

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",
            "Slows down tablets and crashes constantly. So much lagg and crashes it starting to get old fast. About to uninstall this game after 3 days of trying to play."

            "for about 6 years April 2014-July 2020 this was always my go to app, I recommended it to everyone. never had issues, always worked beyond great. but lately, as of July 2020, it randomly crashes. in the middle of a song it just cuts out. thought it was just a minor issue, but it keeps getting worse, as of October 22, 2020, I'm deleting it. I love the customization, and options, but I can't listen to not even 1 full song without it cutting off, went from a 5 star rating to a 2. very disappointing",
            "It Won't add songs to Playlists. On my old cell, this app worked amazingly, I loved it. Recently I had to upgrade my phone and on my new cell I can't make playlists. The app is still great, but I need to be able to add songs to playlists. Edit: I can make Playlists now, but I gotta add the individual tracks. If you try to add a whole album to a list nothing happens. Still love the app, keep it up guys",
            "I hate the software that forces users to rate an app after its initial use. Yes, given the short time I use it its functioning well but time will til. One issue that bothers me is the player only finds items save to the hard drive, which is fine, except my drive is all but fill n I'm now saving mostly to SD card. But I can't do so n still use app. A work around need to be made. That said, everything else is okay for now."

            "One ear is always out. I don't know if it's the app or the actual earbuds but I very rarely automatically get both working at the same time, either the right works and the left doesn't or vice versa. It's official, I hate this even more. The left ear is always out, it doesn't automatically connect to things it was previously connected to. I had a pair of Bose SoundSport which I loved, they took two input, once I'd connected a device as soon as I walked by it it would pick it up. These suck",
            "Honestly, these are the worst ear buds I have ever used. I have previously used two cheap ($20-40) wireless buds and they were better than these. Originally had problems with the buds cutting out for 1 second with loud static. Then I completely lost the left bud. No audio would come from it and when outside the case, it wasn't detected. I tried to reset the buds and unpair in hopes of fixing it, but now I cannot even connect the buds via Bluetooth to my Galaxy s10, my iPad tablet, or my PC. Bad.",
            "It is very useful. It's more useful than attempting to use the buds without the app. The app was optional, but with it, I have full functionality and constant updates which is retained within the buds. So, when I switch them to be used on my PC, the options I have selected still works on my PC!",
            "Was very excited to get these and as soon as I did, my right ear bud hasn't been working. Tried everything to fix it and it's updated to the newest firmware and still nothing. These have the potential to be great but based on the reviews by others it seems they're far from great. Very disappointed, wouldn't recommend buying these until they fix this issue.",
            "They've had an update available for a month and it just never installs (no way to manually force the update). The right bud drains twice as fast as the left. The touch controls sometimes don't function. So far a massive waste of money. Edit: I've done a factory reset, got the update to work (following the ridiculous update method that can't be explained in less than a paragraph). I still believe this is an unfinished product but I'll follow up if the other problems resolve."

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to shortüòÄ but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game üòäüòäü•∞"

            "Very nice game, I always wanted a game that 1. Was like salt 1 and salt 2 2. A game with no ads and doesn't sell personal information. 3. A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"üôàüôâüôä"

            "this is a very nice game .so fun to play and so many levels and entertainment.um at first this game is alright not so many adds but as soon as you get to level 12 or 13 there are so many adds like seriously whenever one adds finished another comes and even when you are playing the game adds come.I hope they clear this problem.thanks for reading!",
            "Don't bother installing. Still can't reply to email or negative response. It was going great until they just recently did a update and I lost 100,000 coins and 22 levels. I was on level 54 and back down to 32. This is BS. I email and also have not received a response. This sucks.",
            "Till level 15 i had good experience with the game i felt i got back the mario game and my long search for the game has ended but at level 16 after covering certain distance there comes a point where there is no way out. Bob goes forward and goes out of the screen means view. And without seeing how can one control? At first i couldn't believe but as i played number of times it was clear.",
            "The game is pretty good but the ads in between the game is disgusting which makes me quit the game. Need to work on that. Ads after the game's over is okay but while playing the game you are showing ads. Not worth to give it a five star rating because of the ads.",
            "I like this game very much but i had completed 160 th level and also updated the game but when i click on 161th level it is coming \"coming very soon\" and this is going from 2 to 4 days. So please fix this issue as soon as possible please so that i can play new levels. Thanku"

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

(Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",

Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game.

I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",

I realize only a few want to create a decent game. Everybody is all about the ads. Pump out crappy games. Deleting this game too. Received all the ad revenue from me you will get.",
            "This game is not really what it advises I was expecting something completely different. It's quite buggy. But I guess it is decent when comparing to other games in this category though I've played better games like this such as meeting cats or other animals where to buy your and such to get extra so I don't know I didn't play it too long before uninstalling but it just felt meh I had no interest in it.",
            "So I downloaded this game and so far I've really liked it and intended to beat it and show my friends but as soon as I got to oberon (the 4th world) I stop getting free spins and my rare mission is stuck at 12 hours except when I'm playing it, but it might be at 11 hours and 50 minutes when I leave the game and when I come back it will have restarted the time!!!!üò°üò°üò°",
            "Used to be a fun game that I wanted to come back to but timers only work in-game which could be an exploit for boosters but it's a disadvantage for missions. Also I remember getting three spins every few hours which I guess doesn't happen anymore? Total downgrade.",
            "Doesn't add spins with time. It says you can have up to 12 but the only way to addore is to get to 0 and add 3 with an add. Also, no timers advance when closed...neither does income. Let me know of you fix these and I'll update this review. Unplayable idle at the later stages as it is..."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting againüòÇü§£. It couldn't stop me from laughing.ü§£üòÇü§£",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

I can't but use my University mail services so I'm stuck with this app either way. do something about it update August, 14, 2020: can't register my account at all. just can't.",

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used.

In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write.

            "Great app! I use this to mess with my friends and family. But, the reason my rating is 4 stars is that there are way too many ads!! I hate that if I want to change a drink, I HAVE TO WATCH AN AD! This has gone out of control. Back then, this game had a fair amount of ads, but now? It's out of control. Another feature I would love is minigames. Also, please make it so that the fruit float so it is more realistic. Overall, 4 stars. Great way to enterain! But please remove some of the ads. Bye! üòÄ",
            "This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over againüôÑ I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!üëã",
            "Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",
            "It's actually pretty good i give it a 5 star rating as we the drinks look 100 percent real as it looks in the app or photos given over here and I don't have to watch an ad i mean if someone is saying this than its totally wrong because i didn't need to watch and ad really cool game üòô",
            "Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. \"Select tones already on device\" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: ("

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",

I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades.

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "Great!! I have had 3 kids and works like a treat as i have had problems in the past but no more. Reminds you when to do exercise, can adjust voice and vibration easily ( as i like to do them early in the morning in bed doesnt wake bubs). You can do kegels 3 times a day without going to settings to change. Its so easy and versatile. Wish the levels carried on but still a great app.",
            "I just started using this app, but so far, it's really convenient. For me, it helps remind me to do these, and it's helpful to have a voice counting and giving basic instructions. For whatever reason, I could never keep myself focused enough to do these with enough repitition to matter. This app helps keep me focused. This developer also has a really nice pedometer app that allows you to track your steps and maps your route, giving you updates along the way. I recommend both of these apps.",
            "I love the app in general, but have two little issues. First, the reminders rarely work (i have 3 per day). Second, I feel like the progression is slightly too fast, so I keep having to go back a level.",
            "First time using this and I have to say I'm impressed. Its really good. The voice assist and the exercises were really good. Looking forward to see whats next in store",
            "I really love this app. It is good for people who haven't done such exercises yet. Special respect for design and information about kegel)"
