            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

What role stress plays in causing IBS\r\n2. What it means to have a \"sensitive colon\"\r\n3. How doctors determine how severe the condition is in any individual sufferer\r\n4. Why the condition of Irritable Bowel Syndrome is so difficult to diagnose in the first place!\r\n5. A description of the other medical conditions and afflictions that IBS shares symptoms with and is commonly confused with!\r\n6. A discussion of both the Manning Criteria and the Rome III Criteria which are used by doctors to officially diagnosis a case of IBS\r\n7. Why both loose bowels and constipation are both symptoms of the condition\r\n8. What types of bowel movements to look for in your toilet bowel that may indicate that you have IBS\r\n9. The physical symptoms that many people suffer when they have IBS\r\n10. What anxiety or depression may have to do with IBS\r\n11. How allopathic doctors test for a positive diagnosis of IBS\r\n12. How the use of laxatives can make it difficult to diagnose the condition\r\n\r\nAnd many more issues to do with the diagnosis Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n\r\nARE YOU FRUSTRATED WITH DRUGS THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE A DOING A THING FOR YOUR IBS?\r\n\r\nYOU ARE NOT ALONE!\r\n\r\nIn Curing Irritable Bowel Syndrome I also go through all of the medicines that you might be prescribed by Western Doctors and give you an idea of what to expect including ...\r\n1. A discussion of diphonenoxylate and atropine and how these two drugs interfere with the passage of waste through your system to control diarrhea\r\n2.Why many experts consider diphenoxylate to be a narcotic that gets you high and why it is also considered to be as dangerous and addictive as any street drug\r\n3. The dangerous drug interactions that can occur if you are taking Nardil or Mantulane\r\n4.

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. üòä",

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",

            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "This is a really great idea, it has loads of tracking options that I just love. But it has some bugs that mean I can't retrospectively add things, for example if I go to bed exhausted and haven't remembered to track my dinner that evening, I can't add it the next day. It also doesn't allow me to add ingredients that are not included on its surprisingly restricted list of ingredients. Overall, wonderful idea but the execution needs work.",
            "The app does a decent job of tracking bowel movements, diet, and medicine. I have noted several issues and sent reports to the app developers. I have received no response. The preset medicine doses will sometimes double or quadruple in your queue and past medical history. I have on prescription that shows up eight times a day when I only take it once a day. Also if you add a duplicate food item you cannot delete it. And the ingredient options and search feature is extremely limited.",
            "Although this is a good app and it is headed in the right direction I find it not as easy or simple to use as other meal or health logging apps. I have my medications listed in the app but I'd like to be able to log if I have had them or not, it's handy to look back and see when I forgot my medication and how it affected me. I find the coloured backgrounds also make it harder to read. And I'd like to see more auto immune flammatory symptoms listed that are connected. E.g., sore back, dermatitis.",
            "Absolutely amazing, thank you so incredibly much for developing (& continuing to improve) this app...it has been a real game changer for me. I've tried many versions of food logs and wellness apps over the years but nothing compares to the insight I have gained through the easy and intuitive design of this application. Tracking my health doesn't feel like a chore anymore!!",
            "I use it to track my bowel movements everyday. It's very helpful for when I have doctors appointments or test/procedures done because when they ask how many times a day I go or about my bleeding and what not all the information is there on my phone and completely accurate because it's recorded. It's also nice because I can remember when I've had scopes or blood tests too because it also tracks that."

            "This is a great app! It keeps me on track as I'm needing to be on the fodmaps diet. Easy to look up foods to see if I'm allowed to eat them. I like recording my feelings and bowel movements. It helps me keep notes so that I have them to discuss with my doctor. Using this app. Has helped me stay in control and as a result my digestive issues have improved tremendously.",
            "Thank you for making a free app to track FODMAP. I've recently been struggling with IBS (ah the curse of aging). This app has really helped me avoid foods that are difficult to digest (high FODMAP). Useful tool to look up high and low foods....really great for the elimination phase of the diet. My favorite feature is the \"diary\" section; you can track what you eat throughout the day and how those foods make you feel. Since using this app I have had far less gas and less stomach cramps.",
            "Only just started to use this App and there is so much in it. So far am loving it, even has quiz games where you can learn which foods are high, medium and low in Fodmaps. The Diary is great too with little reminders to fill in after meals tracking what you have eaten and how you feel. The extensive bank of foods makes it easy to check out foods, you get an instant answer too. I see there is a meditation section, but haven't got that far yet, so much in this little Ap and it's free too.",
            "App is ready to use and I like that it lets you record so much so I can really keep track of how what I eat effects me. It does run really quickly too. I have the Google Pixel 4 and have not experienced any lag with the app, from opening it to using it.",
            "I'm currently waiting for appointment with dietitian, but thought I'd get a feel for what the diet involves. This has been brilliant. Not everything is on here, but it gives you what you guidance as you're shopping. You can log meals, snacks, exercise, set goals, (even stools) and personalise with images and affirmations. Highly recommend with this complex diet."

            "This app gets used multiple times a day. I'm still new enough at Low FODMAP that I need to check everything. What I really like: You just scan the barcode and the info pops up. You can just glance and see \"red\" and know or, you can look at the reasons why and see the ingredients causing the FODMAP issue. This makes the app essentially educational. You learn what to look for to avoid issues. Also, if you were to eat something and have a reaction, you could check it to see what the offending ingredient was and know for next time. I also like that you can submit any product that is not yet there (I mean, there's a lot of products out there!) and the developer gets back to you by email to let you know that he added it. Nice!",
            "Love this app! In the short time I have been using it, I have been able to scan and then avoid a number of IBS triggers that I never would have suspected were high fodmap, which has saved me a lot of future discomfort from extreme bloating. Highly recommend for anyone on the low fodmap diet due to IBS. An invaluable tool!",
            "This app is very helpful for IBS sufferers on Low Fodmap diet, especially on the elimination phase. It can identify trigger ingredients and save you from buying something that can cause you issues. Looking at what others have scanned can also be very useful way to discover what low fodmap options are out there. They also have a facebook page where you can ask questions and offer suggestions. After Monash University App, this is the app I use the most for my low fodmap diet. Thanks guys!",
            "So far, out of the FODMAP apps I've looked at, there are several things this app has that I really like. I didn't delve into the others very far, simply because of what I saw when the apps open. So far, this is the only app I've found with a scanner, that is amazing! You can scan a product, see what ingredients are in the \"moderation\" or \"bad\" category and decide if it's good for you or not. Also, the products are reviewed by medical professionals, big plus!",
            "This app has helped me tremendously to navigate the High Fodmap content of gluten free products that I need to look for being Celiac. As soon as it came out, I scanned many GF products that I had in my cupboard only to find out that more than half of them were High Fodmap. Now when I do my grocery shopping and see interesting GF products, I scan them at the store and save myself a lot of headaches. Keep up the good work. From Ottawa, CANADA"

            "In response to PlopüòÄ Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

        "description": "Food is a common trigger of digestive symptoms. Interestingly, restricting certain foods can dramatically improve these symptoms in sensitive people.\r\n\r\nIn particular, a diet low in fermentable carbs known as FODMAPS is clinically recommended for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\r\n\r\nThis app explains what a low-FODMAP diet is, how it works and what foods are low fodmap.\r\n\r\nA low-FODMAP diet is more complex than you may think and involves three stages.\r\n\r\nStage 1: Restriction\r\nThis stage involves strict avoidance of all high-FODMAP foods. If you're not sure which foods are high in FODMAPs, read this article.\r\n\r\nPeople who follow this diet often think they should avoid all FODMAPs long-term, but this stage should only last about 3‚Äì8 weeks. This is because it's important to include FODMAPs in the diet for gut health.\r\n\r\nSome people notice an improvement in symptoms in the first week, while others take the full eight weeks. Once you have adequate relief of your digestive symptoms, you can progress to the second stage.\r\n\r\nIf by eight weeks your gut symptoms have not resolved, refer to the What If Your Symptoms Don't Improve? chapter below.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Reintroduction\r\nThis stage involves systematically reintroducing high-FODMAP foods.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this is twofold:\r\n\r\nTo identify which types of FODMAPs you tolerate. Few people are sensitive to all of them.\r\nTo establish the amount of FODMAPs you can tolerate. This is known as your \"threshold level.\"\r\nIn this step, you test specific foods one by one for three days each (1Trusted Source).\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you undertake this step with a trained dietitian who can guide you through the appropriate foods. Alternatively, this app can help you identify which foods to reintroduce.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that you need to continue a low-FODMAP diet throughout this stage. This means even if you can tolerate a certain high-FODMAP food, you must continue to restrict it until stage 3.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to remember that, unlike people with most food allergies, people with IBS can tolerate small amounts of FODMAPs.\r\n\r\nLastly, although digestive symptoms can be debilitating, they will not cause long-term damage to your body.\r\n\r\nStage 3: Personalization\r\nThis stage is also known as the \"modified low-FODMAP diet.\" In other words, you still restrict some FODMAPs. However, the amount and type are tailored to your personal tolerance, identified in stage 2.\r\n\r\nIt is important to progress to this final stage in order to increase diet variety and flexibility.",

But I ran into two deal killers for me.  1) you can't retroactively add bowel movements. Which is annoying because sometimes it's inconvenient to track it in the moment. Which leads to issue #2 2) I had a hard time accessing the tracking portion if I didn't have good cell reception. Bathrooms don't always have the best cell service so why I couldn't just track offline is beyond me. This wouldn't be a big problem if I could just log it later, but you can't.  It's a good app just didnt fit my desired style of use."

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

        "description": "This mobile food and symptoms diary enables you to narrow down food intolerances such as lactose, histamine or sorbitol intolerance, fructose malabsorption or food allergies. It can also be used to determine your personal threshold (tolerance level) for different foods once a diagnosis has been made. \r\nThe app contains neither advertisements nor any hidden costs such as in-app purchases.\r\n-----\r\nWhat does \"Lite version\" mean?\r\n-----\r\nThis version is free, there is also a paid PRO version. In the LITE version, you cannot generate a PDF, log your bowel movement, set a reminder, or import data.\r\nIf you like this diary app, you can later buy the PRO version and then export your diary entries from the LITE version and import it into the PRO version.\r\n------\r\nWhy use this app?\r\n-----\r\nIf you believe that you may be suffering from some form of food intolerance or food allergy it is essential to keep a food and symptoms diary for about 2 weeks. With the help of such a food and journal, the medical professional you are consulting can narrow down the reasons for your symptoms. This means they can focus on the right follow-up (eg. H2 breath test) and thus reach an accurate diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe app can also be used after diagnosis. Different foods need to be tested to establish a person‚Äôs individual tolerance level, e.g. fructose or FODMAP levels. Therefore, keeping a food and symptoms diary makes sense. \r\n\r\nThe app is simple and intuitive. You can record your daily meals by entering them into the journal or simply taking a photo.

        "descriptionHTML": "This mobile food and symptoms diary enables you to narrow down food intolerances such as lactose, histamine or sorbitol intolerance, fructose malabsorption or food allergies. It can also be used to determine your personal threshold (tolerance level) for different foods once a diagnosis has been made. <br>The app contains neither advertisements nor any hidden costs such as in-app purchases.<br>-----<br>What does &quot;Lite version&quot; mean?<br>-----<br>This version is free, there is also a paid PRO version. In the LITE version, you cannot generate a PDF, log your bowel movement, set a reminder, or import data.<br>If you like this diary app, you can later buy the PRO version and then export your diary entries from the LITE version and import it into the PRO version.<br>------<br>Why use this app?<br>-----<br>If you believe that you may be suffering from some form of food intolerance or food allergy it is essential to keep a food and symptoms diary for about 2 weeks. With the help of such a food and journal, the medical professional you are consulting can narrow down the reasons for your symptoms. This means they can focus on the right follow-up (eg. H2 breath test) and thus reach an accurate diagnosis.<br><br>The app can also be used after diagnosis. Different foods need to be tested to establish a person‚Äôs individual tolerance level, e.g. fructose or FODMAP levels. Therefore, keeping a food and symptoms diary makes sense. <br><br>The app is simple and intuitive. You can record your daily meals by entering them into the journal or simply taking a photo. You can also track your bowel movement (PRO Version only) or note your symptoms as well as the degree of severity and produce a clearly readable PDF (PRO Version only) which you can take to your doctor‚Äôs appointment. Symptoms can also be recorded by taking a photo, which is especially useful when you have symptoms such as rashes or other skin changes.<br><br>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)<br>The app can also be used for recording the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn‚Äôs disease. <br><br>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<br>Also patients who follow a FODMAP diet due to IBS may use this app to track their nutrition and symptoms.<br><br>-----<br>Questions or comments?<br>-----<br>This app has its own support forum at www.food-intolerance-network.com.

The wikipedia link they provided had no mention of the salicylate content of cranberries. It wasn't until I searched it further on reliable allergy sites that I came across it repeatedly marked as VHS. Very disappointed.",

            "Would be nice to filter only green/yellow+green categories and maybe save that filter. It would help to find out which type of foods aren't working for me and causing me issues. I think it's histamines but not sure yet.",
            "I'm glad I decided to spend a little bit of money to buy this app. The food database is very big, the filter options work great and the info is solid. The only places where I saw inconsistencies with other sources are actually current subjects of debate in the scientific community so it seems like the creators did a very good job compiling the info. The only slight beef I have with the app is that it's not very appealing to the eye but the simplicity of the UI is great!"

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book üò≠ I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",
            "This app is great. Tracks a ton of information I can share with my doctor. Quick.  Easy. Love the reports and notes features."

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause.",

            "Overall, I like this app. I just have a couple suggestions to make. -Add a trash feature, so that you still have some time to get a deleted picture back in case you accidentally delete something or change your mind. -Add a slider to the video playback. With really long videos, it's annoying to have to watch the entire thing through to get to certain parts, even with the fast-forward.",
            "This app is great! There's not that many ads, there's the right amount of tools to make wonderful drawings! It can be a little confusing at first but you'll soon get used to it! The only problem I have is, you have to have a membership to rearrange art order in your gallery?? I know they need to make some money somehow but... That just seems ridiculous and unnecessary, but other then that it's great!",
            "I need help, like when I was coloring the drawing that I just finished, suddenly it disappears, i was very scared of what just happened, i think I can redo it but I clicked on the redo button for like 1000 times it still doesn't give me back my drawing. I'm very anxious after what just happened. So can someone please help me out with this, please...üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞",
            "This is byfar one of the best and very intuitive drawing app, I can work faster using Ibis compared to when I'm working with another drawing app. Stabilizer works great, doesn't stabilize too much, although I'd rather have the heavy stabilizer as optional because sometimes I need it too. Or at least there's more curved or flex ruler.",
            "I love this app and I would recommend but you have to be aware of lower battery and deleting this app. But there are so many cool things you can do. I use this all the time. It's easy, fun and free only, you have to watch an add before using all brushes. This is good quality and needs no WiFi."

It occurs more frequently than any other disease of the intestines.\r\n    Cancer may occur at any point in the gastrointestinal tract, and includes mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer.\r\n    Inflammatory conditions. Ileitis is an inflammation of the ileum, Colitis is an inflammation of the large intestine.\r\n    Appendicitis is inflammation of the vermiform appendix located at the caecum. This is a potentially fatal condition if left untreated; most cases of appendicitis require surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nDiverticular disease is a condition that is very common in older people in industrialized countries.

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. üòÇ The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. üòÇ",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

A flexible statistics sections shows which diets, foods and habits that are good or bad for you.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you use the app in the following way:\r\n\r\nTry many different diets (no dairy or gluten, vegan, low carb, high fiber, fodmap etc etc) and log very carefully how you feel when you try these diets. \r\n\r\nLog what you eat, exercise etc and how you feel in the app. You are going to do detective work here and you need good clues. Since it is very time consuming looking through paper journals, I strongly recommend you writing the food diary in digital form. The important thing here is that it should be easy to go back to your best or worst days (which you can in this app).

A flexible statistics sections shows which diets, foods and habits that are good or bad for you.<br><br>It is recommended that you use the app in the following way:<br><br>Try many different diets (no dairy or gluten, vegan, low carb, high fiber, fodmap etc etc) and log very carefully how you feel when you try these diets. <br><br>Log what you eat, exercise etc and how you feel in the app. You are going to do detective work here and you need good clues. Since it is very time consuming looking through paper journals, I strongly recommend you writing the food diary in digital form. The important thing here is that it should be easy to go back to your best or worst days (which you can in this app).

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess üôÑ",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them üôÇüñï",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. üò°",

I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",

Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",

            "This game was fun while it lasted. My niece who is 4 and myself played side by side to see who would win of course she always won!! In one day we managed to finish the whole game. It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",
            "This game is absolutely amazing, I had a great experience playing this with my friends. Life changing I'm now married and have 3 kids because of this game",
            "Funny thing about this thing I worry about distance from the round table or the one that I have a great example for me a min and I have a good idea of what is going on in my computer though and i'm still trying to find a way out for your English papers to be there for dinner somemore but I think that u are not assessed.",
            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",
            "I find this game okay, I guess. It's just the ads that really ruin the experience for me. You get an ad every level, and each level takes less time than the ad you receive after."

They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. üòä",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

This app only works once in a blue moon on the 13th day of every other month.",

If it's possible, I can't find it. :( Edit: I deleted the app. It kept freezing up, there was no intuitive way to adjust the font style or size, & it would sometimes just go dark.

            "Update: I was able to refresh the license through the Play Store settings. After uninstalling on my old phone it will not let me use the \"pro\" version on my new phone. The subscription renewed last May for the year, but constantly tries to get me to upgrade and pay again from with the app. It's stupid that I can't download a \"pro\" version from the app store, and forced to pay again from within the app. Very deceptive.",
            "Cant get the app to work Edit: Cant get the app to work. When I click \"Analyze\" it takes me back to \"Home Screen\". I click de app again, I get a message that says \"App keeps closing\". Below that there are two options. 1. App info. 2. Close app. And that`s it. I have this app in another Android tablet and works fine. But it won't work on this new Galaxy tab S5e Android tablet.",
            "It does great things for the performance of the phone. In my opinion it doesn't need to look flashy, isn't that defeating the purpose of lowering ram usage, lol.",
            "Down loaded it. Opened it. Get a prompt asking me to turn a switch on. I would if I had the faintest idea how to access/find the switch. No link, no instructions and after trying to activate every potential icon I still don't get any further forward. Another example of a program relying on people already knowing how to work it. But for me, just a waste of memory space. I get faster and better results from just rebooting.",
            "I use to use CCleaner years ago when I was in the computer repair field. When I found out CCleaner was available on Android naturally I was intrigued. After using it for well over a month I found CCleaner to be utterly useless. #1. It doesn't do anything my phone doesn't already do. #2. The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps. Low and behold it was drastically off."

Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.üò£ everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by thisüòê"

            "I've been using this app for years now, it's absolutely brilliant I love it and I would recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a better system for their files than the one pre installed on their phone. All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely?

No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE."

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed üòû",

If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# üò± Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! üòÄ By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review‚àö",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "I absolutely love and enjoy playing this game. Usually when I start playing rhythm games I tend to stop after a week or less. For this app, I been playing it for over a month and don't plan on stopping any time soon because of how much fun it is. Unfortunately, I cannot give this game 5 stars because of how bad it glitches or stops mid song. I would open the app and start playing a song, after 5mins it would completely freeze and glitch as of I failed the song. Please fix this bug problem!",
            "The game itself is very good, but the problem is that it's a pay-to-win game, you have to spend money to get a high rank card, while people who don't want to spend money they need weeks or even months to get an R rank card, it's just very frustrating to get to the #1 in the weekly ranking without spending cash, the R coins are just useless because it's just for buying background, and most good backgrounds need to be bought with 300+ or more diamonds, if this problem was solved, it's a 5 star.",
            "Why do I have to download so much before I can open the app? It's like that every single time. Why can't I just download it once? Before, this only happens if there are new updates for the game. Now, it takes too long before you can open the app because of these downloads for 'additional resources'. And the app crashes a lot, too. I used to enjoy this app before because it's different from other rhythm games and I get to enjoy songs from my faves. Please fix these issues.",
            "I like this game very much , but since 221020's update , I can't open my game anymore . It's just keep on black screen and I uninstalled a few times already. When I install it again, it can open already but it won't finish the data download, I have a lot of space in my phone but the game still can't finish the data download",
            "Even though I have all the different Superstar versions, JYP is the only one I play. This is by far my favorite out of the 6 versions. I haven't had any bugs since I first downloaded it. I hope Dalcomsoft keeps JYPNATION running forever because I love playing it whenever I get a chance to! :) Edit: since the Live Theme update, the game takes forever to load"

Used it again in the last week's and it was impossible both via my WiFi and via the Vodafone network. First endless apologies for having insufficient capacity and promising a text when available. Gave up waiting was able to connect, was thrown out twice while waiting for an SMS confirmation which arrived later in a batch.",
            "Horrible. Almost always was told there wouldn't be anyone available and to try again in a few days. Opted to get SMS from the wait list and after several days no response. The first two times I managed to connect the program froze and I had to do it all again. Necessary evil to validate a credit card I guess",
            "I could blame it on the device I'm using but then I would have to put the blame on the other five devices I have tried it on + the 4G and the WiFi I got. It's simply being stuck on the \"connecting with one of our agents \" pop-up message",
            "This is the biggest garbeage app I've ever seen. It never works, no matter if you're in WiFi or mobile data. It's always producing errors or sends you to a que, but you'll never see the end of the que.",
            "They pretend like they do remote identification, but they don‚Äôt. I tried it tens of times, from different smartphones - whenever it comes to turning on the camera light - it breaks (of course if the whole app does not freese before that - then you get your failure even earlier). Several hours of wasted time in total, inability to use my credit card, which I need now to rent a car - and I will lose money for car booking - like the whole situation wasn‚Äôt enough. \"Great\" service"

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications üò∂I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand üòê cause of the translator. Please fix these issues üôÇ",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",

Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping ü§£ its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day üòÇ The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more üëå",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off ü§£. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

Even after updating I am still getting the same errors. In addition, its not opening any links left in screen that i get news notifications...sorry I don't know the name of that particular screen. However, I would have given 5 stars! Fix the problem and I'll upgrade my 1-star rating.",
            "Riddled with annoying ads especially the annoying Korean ad dubbed in English of the firefighter using an infrared camera. Very repetitive stories; news content very selective in coverage and is not changed rapidly enough. App indicates on its icon new news stories but when opened the user is not expedited to the new news stories; there is no personalization to filter out content that is less or not interesting to the user with focus on content of interest, not b.s.. CNN the channel is better.",
            "The \"cast\" button keeps disappearing from my Android phone display. I can watch CNN or HLN on the phone but not cast to the TV. The button appeared once, I clicked it, but now all I see on my TV is the red CNN logo. Plus, what's up with the \"two screens\" display on the phone at the top? What is that for? So confusing.",
            "I have this app for breaking news alerts, but in the past couple of days I've been getting \"alerts\" about interviews and other CNN content. In my settings, I ONLY have breaking news selected. If this keeps happening I'll have to find a new breaking news app",
            "Not sure what's going on with the Android version of CNN. Videos don't work at times, links don't go to matching video from Home page on app. And when I open the app, it takes me back to the same article from weeks ago (even when I close the app, or all my app). I'm on a Note 10+ so not on an Android device. It worked bigger on my iPhone 7. Deleting and reading from there or on a browser. Bummer."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! üòä",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

        "comments": [
            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüëç‚ô•Ô∏è",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "The controls are terrible, you constantly get spawned next to bigger players, and the battle royal mode doesnt even work. It loads for a second and takes you straight back to the main page. Waste of time. Also, every button you press will probably popup an add, 6 things you have to close out of, and then another add. I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",
            "Fun game but too many ads and popups about the VIP. If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",
            "Evreything is fun amazing and great. Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",
            "I cant express how much i love this came however a few days ago i bought a really cool skin which wad 3900 coins, i loved it but when i went on to play today the skin had disappeared and now i dont have it. I dont even have the coins back. Over all iys a really cool gameüôÇ"

        "description": "Stomach ache and abdominal pain\r\nA stomach ache is a term often used to refer to cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It's usually short-lived and is often not serious.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis ‚Äì the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer ‚Äì a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones ‚Äì small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis ‚Äì inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS ‚Äì a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ‚Äì long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning ‚Äì in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain ‚Äì painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems ‚Äì such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. \r\n2. Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow!

            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ‚ú®",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",
            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Googleüòäüòäüòä"

            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

This is a workaround and may encounter limitations caused by the selected messaging app or even the Android OS:\r\n1) Text messages are recovered by your notifications, therefore, if you have put a chat on silence, or if you are currently watching a message on the messaging app before it's deleted you will not receive a notification so WAMR can't save it! This also obviously means that is impossible to recover notifications/messages before you downloaded this app (so download it quickly!).\r\n\r\n2) If messages aren't being saved, it may be caused by Android killing WAMR. Please remove WAMR from all battery optimization services!\r\n\r\n3) WAMR can't save files if they aren't completely downloaded! So if you are offline or you have an unstable connection, or in general if the sender deletes the message containing a media before the messaging app downloads it, WAMR can't do anything to save it.\r\n\r\n4) If you aren't using a WiFi connection, some media may not be automatically downloaded by your messaging app because of your settings. You can change this behavior in Messaging app > Settings > Data and storage usage and increase your chances.\r\n\r\nOther limitations may be caused by your Android version, or your system language (in particular if it is right-to-left).

Often doesn't record audio, images, videos and statuses, even if notifications are on and downloading media is fully on(wi-fi and mobile data). In play market, there's only one app that records (supposed to record and save) all deleted messages, and that's WAMR.(4 stars) 10/16/2020: It can't store data on sd card...(2 stars)",
            "Everything works fab !!! The only thing which needs to be fixed is : 1. Why does it recover the media which i deleted myself from gallery. 2. It just shows the statuses which i opened rather than showing all the statuses. 3. Lastly in the status section categorize it as photos & videos. Plz fix this, it will surely rock the app...",
            "Well the app is great. But sometimes it fails to recover media even when it is fully downloaded. And now it doesn't work because I moved the contents of WhatsApp to SD card. Please fix this error. Make it so that it can still show media when it is being downloaded to SD. Otherwise it is awesome.",
            "It should be able to capture those messages and media which I haven't seen or opened. Suppose I miss a message while I am sleeping, I should be able to get those messages even when the sender has deleted it.. Otherwise it works relly perfect. Thank you for all your hard work.",
            "It is very useful in the beginning but gradullay it cannot work properly the name we cannot saved in our contact he/she sent a message to whatsapp or any other medias if they delete the message we cannot see that I cannot get the notification i enable the notification i cant get it But sometimes it is very useful app to me I suggest to everyone in this app Thankyou"

            "Its good app for calling and all. But i wnt to add group chat shortcuts in my mobile desktop. But its not working for business whatsapp. And in delete chat data need options date wise or month wise delete. It will very useful for business. Pls do the needful. Need urgently. From last 1 week after new update it was not working. When i was forwarding or searching its not working. Asking for close or wait. Earlier update is good. Now is very worst. Pls update soon. Need urgently. No use. Reupdate",

Some of my contacts suddenly went missing from my WhatsApp even though they're still on my phone üì± I thought the issue was from my phone but I just saw another person complaining about it here. I use this account for business and most of my contacts view my status. Now how will I get people to view my status when they aren't on my list?ü§∑üèæ This is frustrating to be honest. Please do something about this.",
            "Not as convenient as I thought it would be. The whole point of me downloading this was so I minimize the stress of getting back to my customers late on my personal WhatsApp with the auto reply when I'm offline function but it's as useless because it doesn't work and I only receive messages from customers days later if I don't check the app now and again, it's not at all instant as the normal WhatsApp because there even if I'm not online, as long as I have internet connection, I will receive text",
            "please create a 'word done' option in the chat box. like we 'star' an important chat. same like that but the 'word done' status could be seen by the sender also. this will help us to know that the work that was assigned is done or not. it will save our time.üôèüôè",
            "Give us the option to block only calls from people. I dislike people calling me randomly when i don't want to speak. You could add a feature where you can block calls from groups or certain individuals undefinitely or for specific periods. We don't have to have only a block option that works if we block folks from both calls and messages. Thank you."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! üòâ",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "I love this app!! It has so many cartoon-ish pictures and you will never know what colours will be in it, so that's what makes it exciting... There are also many pictures of realistic paintings of ladies under the topic \"FASHION\"... But the reason why I rated this app four stars is that you need to pay money for a few pictures.. You need to pay money for all the zodiac signs and for most of the realistic painings of ladies... That is one my my complaints. Another one is that there are many adsüòï",
            "I love this app and ive been using for over a year now and its super good. Multiple different things you can color and its pretty cool. I would have given it 5 stars but the reason i gave 4 is because it has too many ads. If they could improve this then its a 5 starred app..",
            "This app is super good I loved it and it is the best app to do online painting I will prefer this Only one thing that I didn't like is it contains ads I am sure the team will do something",

            "I like this app There is more design to colour and there is ideas for Rangoli, can draw and magic , save the drawing and sent to someone else ,so i like this app",
            "All my saved work disappeared with the latest update. Other than that I really like the app. But why put that much time into it if everytime the app updates all your work is gone.",
            "This would be a higher rating, except that there is no more save button. When I tried to save my finished page, it saved from only halfway done. Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ‚ù£Ô∏è the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "I absolutely love and enjoy playing this game. Usually when I start playing rhythm games I tend to stop after a week or less. For this app, I been playing it for over a month and don't plan on stopping any time soon because of how much fun it is. Unfortunately, I cannot give this game 5 stars because of how bad it glitches or stops mid song. I would open the app and start playing a song, after 5mins it would completely freeze and glitch as if I failed the song. Please fix this bug problem!",
            "Used to really love this game a couple years ago. But now it won't even open on my Galaxy S9. Just stays on a white screen forever even after reinstalling... (Edit) Decided to reinstall on a whim and it seems to be working just fine! Would highly recommend that there not be an inventory limit though considering there are more cards to collect than playable songs it seems.",
            "I love this game, I really do. But this past month whenever I play it, in a middle of the game it freeze and it makes me mad because I lost the score. At first I thought it'd because I play it while charging my phone, but even when I'm not charging it still freeze in a middle of a game. Please fix it, thank you in advance.",
            "ive been playing this game for almost a year now and this recently just happened... its been months since i last opened my app and now it wont even open anymore??? like its just pure black screen why is that?? ive tried reinstalling it and everything is just the same??? its been months now thats why i havent still played the app. and its still the same black screen. please fix it.",
            "i love this game soooo much because u can listen to music while playing plus i reallly like sm artists so thats a plus for me of course but i really hate to wait at the main screen you know when you about to enter the game after the dalcomsoft word pop out. After that the game wont load and if it do load, it will leave the app. My data is not that weak i also use wifi so im not sure what is the problem but anyways i hope it get fixed. update: my app wont open"

Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",

After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

NOTE: Ensure that location permission is turned on or the app may not function properly for you -- I didn't see AP networks until the permission was turned on. Also if you've paid, you can turn off advertisement. Select the tool (wrench) icon, and scroll to the bottom, check hide ad. Enjoy all the 802.11 radio spectrum details where ever you might be looking at it!",
            "This has been my go-to wifi analyzer for many years, but looks like it hasn't been updated since 2018. So under Android 10, it doesn't work and shows a blank screen... unless you go into App Permissions to approve location and storage. It is obvious that the author has abandoned this app, since the banner ad on the bottom is not even working anymore, which may be a plus for the users. Otherwise the app is very functional. Kinda of like Picasa, once these apps were the best in their categories, but still very good and usable, even though they have been abandoned for years. Pretty sad, really... If the author sees this comment, I encourage you to make it open source and post it on github, so others can help to maintain it.",
            "Great app, but it doesn't remember I paid for it. I have to launch it from the Google Play Store app list in order for the app to remember that I have paid for the ad free version. If I launch from the native app on my phone, BAM, ads and offers to remove ads by paying for the ad free version. I would have given 5 stars, and still will, if this bug is fixed.",
            "Important: to get it to work on Android 10 you need to manually give it Location and Storage permissions in Android's App Settings. Only 4 stars since not updated any more. But great app. Thanks for the previous reviewers who helped with the permissions issue.",
            "This does not work on Android 10 correctly. I found how to get it working on posts here in the rating section. Thank you to those who have advised. I've loved this app for years. It's a little complicated for some to get working, but when working it's a great tool. I'm not giving it a full 5 stars as it really needs updating to work without fuss"

            "One of the best apps for trading but I find Stocks & etfs to be limited, its quite annoying as I love the app, easy to use & reliable but when doing a search & not being able to find some well known & opular stocks/etfs that can be easily found in other apps makes the experience frustrating as I can't keep growing my portfolio & also more historical data for the stocks is needed as it seems to only show you until it was added to T212 for the first time? Will change to 5‚òÜ when this improves.üëç",
            "After a bit of practice this app is very intuitive and easy to use. Quite addictive but some care is needed esp when doing CFD's. Care also to avoid getting carried away buying and trading. Lots of options available and moving/withdrawing funds is very easy. All in all a great app. and to be recommended if you have an interest in stocks, shares etc.",
            "Generally, excellent. It's currently the only decent app I've used for trading within an ISA. It's very easy to use, you can get money in and out pretty quickly, the technical indicators are good and their support is very responsive. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the automatic trading triggers are a little dumb and there's no pre or after market trading but these are only an issue for more advanced users.",
            "This app is a perfect start for people new to investing. It has a nice ui combined with a practise mode for those uneasy about investing during the current economic crisis. Ive used it ever since i realised turning a profit on fake money in video games was enjoyable and applying it to real life its a thrilling gamble (investment) ease of access, guides, and multiple optuons for methods of investing."

Ads are present, however they're not really distracting in any way (some small ad banners and maybe a skipable ad every 10 or so minutes). Overall, definetly recommend. It's quick, it's easy, pouring river water into your socks- I mean making a meme with this. Yes, that's what I meant.",
            "Does what it's supposed to for free, so ads are inevitable but not overly intrusive with this app. Can't ask for much more. Great for making your own formats if you don't want to choose one from their constantly updated list. -Edit: You're welcome. Your app lets me make something that makes others laugh. Only free app that's ever been worth a full 5 to me.",
            "This app is amazing! There's so many memes, old and new. Somehow can't find a template you want? Just download it online and make a custom meme! You can even make it an editable template if you want! The app updates frequently, which is nice. And the best part is that there's no watermark. Five stars, totally reccomend for people who wanna make memes! :)",
            "Absolutely the best meme making app out there. The sheer amount of memes and things you can make is incredible. The ads aren't bad at all. They show up on the banner on the bottom and like every once in a while come up full-screen but who cares this is perfect. UPDATE: Updated it 5* because they fixed my only complaint (mismatched status bar)! Thank you for doing that. I bought the Pro version as well because of it :)",
            "Ads are normally a common complaint with free apps but this one brought a delightful change. Adds only show up every once in a while, You can skip the rest of the add often after 5 seconds, this app even gives you a big X so you don't get brought to the app store. Thank you for not bombarding us with adds."

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",

I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

And then open the gallery of new phone but my photos and videos was not there , there was lots of precious memory I am shocked and it is a mentally attack for me. I need my data back. I go to zapya app again and in history data is showing there but not open. Help pleas",
            "Best app.Its awesome. It took only 1min 31 seconds to share free fire obb file of 675 mb. Best app ever. Best from shareit also its good to transfer big files. And it took only 5 minutes 38seconds to share obb file of call of duty of 1.58 gb. Its the best app you should try it.",
            "Awesome sharing app. This is better than Shareit I think. But why I'm giving 4 star is the app becomes some time slow like 300-600 kbps. It's not that much big problem. But guys time is lot important the sharing. So good luck.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one‚ù§Ô∏è!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen üëëeven when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant üòÅüòâ",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "This game is ok I would never play this in my freetime, and I don't like the animaton. It's terrible and the animation sucks! It looks like the creator just rushed it when it could have been a good game but you rushed it. If your pregnant and you want to learn about being pregnant I do recommend, but for all of you that are not, look at something else!!!",
            "The is perfect for pregnant women. It teaches you everything i am very proud of the creators. But the reason i reduced a star because you cannot operate the woman that's a little disappointing. Creators if you are reading this its a humble request to add this feature please please. I love this game and i dont want to uninstall it.",
            "Very good game...portrays a pregnant mother's life accurately. Excellent! The only thing is that I felt the 'Baby Care' level a bit boring. The rest was all excellent! Going to hospital, ordering items from iPhone....very good. Just improve 'Baby Care' level and then include more and more of levels...overall, nice game!üëçüëç sufficient to get 4 stars!!",
            "FINALLY A GAME WITH EASY CONTROLS !!!!!! I love this game I just wish it had more levels and more to do so far everything is so accurate! Maybe giving baby a bath more levels of baby getting older feeding him in a high chair changing clothes etc mom cooking going to the store taking baby for a walk in stroller or if baby grows and walks as a toddler take him to play ! I'm just glad theres no timer either ! I totally love this game so I'll keep it downloaded and wait for more levels ! Great game!",
            "This app is amazing the little details are so incredible! It feels so realistic however there are some small issues in my opinion I don't understand why when you buy clothes on the pregnancy app it shows dresses and a t-shirt, if she can only wear the track suits why not just have her buy the track suits instead of the dresses? Also it's a little annoying that when you have a baby boy he's in a super girly nursery I think all the baby stuff should had been made gender neutral. Great game tho!"

Not only is the game beautifully polished, from the art, to the gameplay to the sounds, but it's also completely free from all the things that ruin mobile gaming. There are no ads, and the in-app purchases are completely optional. The game is just as fun whether or not you shell out money. The fact that this game is free to play is honestly a miracle. Undoubtedly one of the best mobile games out there.",
            "I got Pok√©mon Cafe Mix on the Nintendo Switch when it first came out and I have absolutely loved it so far but I really wish I can transfer my data to the mobile version from the switch so I don't have to start all over again and have to do all the missions just to get the Pok√©mon that come in. Is there a way to actually transfer it to your phone?",
            "Firstly the art style is gorgeous and actually makes me appreciate some of the pokemon I never did before. Secondly there's so many different obstacles that make a lot of rounds feel unique. Overall, quite enjoyable. Once I get into it it's a bit hard to stop!",
            "Super cute! I was having doubts whether to install it or not, when I installed the game man, it was so worth it, nice artwork, very calm gameplay I could just tap all Pok√©mon while eating and disturb them lol... I just wish that I could design the cafe my own way thou and have a much more open experience in having to design and buy stuff (I don't know if such a feature exist I just started) all in all super cute, and satisfying gameplay thumbs up! :3",
            "Thus game is fabulous! Good for some time pass or whenever bored, there are many pokemons to work with in the cafe! Overall i love it, and i would strongly recommend this to parents also as this could be a nice game for your kids and who knows, you can engage as well! So download thus app and don't keep thos adorable pokemons waiting!!üòäüëç"

            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "For being one of the largest television providers, your app is hot garbage. Not easy to navigate or find what you're looking for. But the DVR functionality is the worst. The whole point of the app is to be able to watch what I pay for on the go, and be able to access my DVR. The app syncs to my box but as soon as I leave my wifi I can no longer access my DVR shows. Fix this immediately!",
            "1. Difficulty logging on! 2. While watching a TV program. A commercial comes on. After the commercial the program puts me back to the beginning of the show. Then you have to toggle and try to find where you were. If you don't hit the right spot you go to another commercial and you have to wait again or go back to the beginning of the program. 3. The toggle to forward or reverse your position in a TV show is very sensitive and hard to use. I'm very surprised at DirecTV with such a sloppy program.",
            "Absolutely the worst app ever. Every show I try to watch restarts from the beginning after the first set on endless commercials. When I try to return to where I left off, the app either freezes, starts fast forwarding, plays picture with no sound, or sound with no picture. Rediculous! And I'm only giving 1 star because you're forcing me to before letting me post.",
            "I suppose it works to watch stuff On Demand if you missed something yesterday, same thing you can do on a computer. But, I don't comprehend how this app, for years, still has some sort of problem when watching your own DVR. It fails all the time. Today, I download an episode of a show. It finishes within 10 minutes. I open up my Downloads, it's not there. I download it again, the 10 minutes pass, again, and then it's finally marked as downloaded and ready. And yet. I click play, and it crashes.",
            "Does a lot of buffering even when connected to wifi. Drives me nuts that it doesn't keep track of where I am in previously watched shows. Then if I try to skip forward to find where I left off, I have to sit through 3 mins of commercials. No matter if I skip forward 20 mins or 2 mins. Again, this could be avoided if the app did a better job of tracking previously watched shows."

You still need to go online to download recipes and other stuff but you can play offline now and you guys added so much activities to the game. You can fish, you can cook, sell, grow fruits, own a restaurant, etc.. it worth it now. Thank you so much.",
            "I like the game. Ive been playing it for about a day or two, the ads are fine (i mean you have to make money some how) the only thing I don't like is the farm, shop, ect have a time limit and if you pass that time limit, you can't play for the rest of the day. I think thats kinda stupid i don't understand why its like that",
            "I LOVE this game! It's not just \"cooking,\" but has various other activities for you to compete to run a restaurant; like fishing, harvesting an orchard and garden, and running your restaurant. The game helps me to zone out and relax, and the slight Japanese theme running through out reminds me of my time spent in Japan ‚ô°. Anyone at any age can play. I wouldn't waste your time buying any in app purchases though, don't really need them to enjoy this app."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

What is happening? Why you are trying to sabotage my work? I paid for the watermark but don't expect me to buy the pro package. So disappointed! Thank you for ruining my work!",
            "I'm very disappointed with the experience on Android ... this app is amazing and full of option... but...the application lag constantly, doesn't matter what recording I use (60 or 30 Fram) The application works properly on Apple products and when i try to use it on Android (Galaxy Z Fold 2) its lagging. I can't use any of my videos ... And I paid every months for it...",
            "I love your app because of several reasons first - When we complete the editing of any video there is no watermark in the video Second - there are many video editing options even we didn't join the premium that's awesome!! Third - it has been the best video editing app when It goes for a update so these are all things I love (not like) (love is better than like ) about this app üëçüëçüëç"

            "I hate that ads are automatically placed at the top of my email every time I open the app. Then, when Im scrolling down through my emails, there is this wierd break in the list to show me yet another advertisement in the background. Also, deleting large amounts of email is tedious and takes forever. Half the time, it crashes before deleting anything. That being said, apart from the advertising forced on me, the app looks good and I like that I can change to color of the bar at the top.",
            "This app is harder to use after I updated. The files no longer display a constant subfolder. I have to select from the main folder every time. Also, it takes longer to move from one folder to another. It still has the issue of not allowing me to move a subfolder, so I have to create a new subfolder, move contents from one to another, then delete the old one. The improvements have not improved it. I am a bit sorry I updated.",
            "Really bummed after recent updates. Before, when you wanted to move a number of emails to the same folder and opened up the folders list, it displayed the folder you were using. Now, whenever you open the folders list, you're at the beginning of the list and the first folder. So each time you have to repeatedly scroll to the proper folder. I also don't like the links to similar emails that appear at the top of each email. You have to scroll down to see the email message. Put em at the bottom.",
            "What's happened with this app? It constantly freezes up. I have to keep closing and opening it in an attempt to read my mail. I've used this app for a long time with no problems but lately it is just a horrible experience. I am using a Samsung S2 tablet. I've had similar problems on my S9 phone. My Internet is fine. I have no issues with anything else. What's up?",
            "Nothing but problems since having to reload app on the 20th of October. Been a loyal subscriber for 20 years, but will change if improvement isnt seen in the next day or so. App is taking forever to update and replicate on Samsung S2 Tablet. Never had this issue on the 'old' application. The S20 phone doesn't seem to have a problem other than continually trying to load. It's is not a network or wifi issue."

There is an issue with the ads but that doesn't really bother me alot I don't find it a problem.. you can create vlogs, dress your avatar up, make vlogs, and more! Other than the ads this game is amazing. The way that you can comment on peoples vlogs/videos is AMAZING! Its really fun how you get 10,000 subs in one day. I hope the future updates are good too!",
            "I love this game! Its amazing and has so many things that are cool! One thing that would be better is maybe if u could comment on other peoples videos just like in real life!! Other thann that there is a really good game that every one should install as soon as possible! Make sure that u dont have ads though because there are a lot of them! Makers if your reading this please cut back on all the ads they are kinda annoying and ridiculous how many there are! But overall its a really AMAZING game!!",
            "I love this game! I would give it 5 stars but there is a lot of tapping and the more videos you make the longer it lakes to make them. I wish you could comment on other people's videos and comments. You should make it so you can interact with different objects like the swimming pool and basketball hoop and maybe even control what you are doing in the videos. Like you say your going to do sports as the topic and then you try and shoot hoops for the video. I do recommend this game, it's fun!",
            "Amazing game! I love playing it. I would recommend it, has fun rewards, you can watch a stream, etc. But one thing that bugs me is when I got more then 5,000 subscribers, the box thing didn't unlock. Please fix it and I will get a 5 star rating for you.",
            "It's a pretty fun game I've been looking for something like this for a while. The reason for three stars is bc to post a video all you do is just pick a topic and done. Like you can only TALK about something not like do a challenge. I wanted to do a WoF video but you can't do that."

            "Pretty enjoyable, better than checking Bulbapedia multiple times for sure. Being able to check locations, sprites, moveset, type matchups, BST from all of the 890+ pok√©mon with no problems at all, is really satisfying. Interface is pretty solid, and even thinking that having to pay for the premium to use dark mode (who I'm a huge fan of), is still not a big of a deal, and for sure won't make me dislike this app at all. Probably my favorite Pok√©dex app I have ever seen. Keep up the good work! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®",
            "I love this app, and all of the team builders that I can save. Its great for my mind that won't shut up. My only issue is that for the team builder, I can't select regional forms of pokemon for my team (i.e. Galarian Ponyta). I can evolve some (i.e. Pikachu) to it's regional form, but not the ones that don't have a split evolution. Aside from that, its a wonderfully made app with frequent updates!",
            "This is amazing!! I can look at the locations and for the upper gens 5-8, I can actually check the area, like for Sword and Shield, not only does it tell me where the pokemon appears in, but I can see the conditions such as \"It only appears when it's raining\". If I have one problem though, it has to be the cries of the gen 8 pokemon. They sound very low quality and in some cases, it sounds a bit like your device's speaker is broken. Crown Tundra is here, aling with the locations!",
            "This app literally has everything you could possibly want in a pokedex app. It has a full pokedex/itemdex for information and location, and team building with in depth analysis of weaknesses and coverage. There is nothing left out! I dont see how any other app can compete with what dataDex offers. Not to mention they update the app often so they are always giving the most new and accurate information! 5/5 EZ",
            "Very nice app, and it could be great! Would love to see the ability to search through all available swsh pokemon, and not have them broken up by galar/isle of armor/crown tundra. It's super nice that I can sort the dex by a stat, but i wish i could sort every pokemon. Also, there are some issues with the move dex. I don't think that the \"Pokemon who learn this move\" works right. I'd also love to be able to sort by moves available in swsh. Not just moves introduced in swsh, and no removed ones."

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!‚õëÔ∏è",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ‚ú≥Ô∏è üí´!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ‚ùå Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

When you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native English speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your English speaking skills!\r\n\r\nWhen traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk).

Speak English with confidence!<br><br>The ‚ÄúLearn English‚Äù app has many useful English phrases and words (e.g., ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù or ‚ÄúA table for two, please!‚Äù). When you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native English speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your English speaking skills!<br><br>When traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk).

Someone was taking money out of my account. Huntington caught the suspicious activity immediately. I lost a minimal amount that they are reimbursing. Thank you for saving the rest! Amazing!!!",
            "I find it extremely annoying to be constantly asked if I want to use new tools. These banners get in my way and closing it is just one more step I need to do before having my standard view, without the annoying, unsolicited new feature. It's always something new being offered. At one point I was asked if I want to see how my monthly expenses break down and I said \"No\". But months later it was added to my view anyway. I DON'T care, but they decided I am going to see it anyway. Very annoying",
            "Wheel goes round and round and can't login. Rediculous! It's been weeks now and no help! I still can not use the budget or analysis tools now for weeks. I get no support. The at that is online is so much better, it works. No one seems to care to help. Oh well, that's a shame for Huntington to have an app that doesn't work. What does that say about the bank.",
            "With the Android 11 update, the mobile check deposit was temporarily shut down. When it was available again, the camera options were not functional properly. I was able to take a picture of the front of my check and had difficulty taking a photo of the back of the check. This was because the camera seemed to be distorted oddly, like a fun house mirror.",
            "I have loved the app for years and use it to check my accounts almost daily. However, last week after my pixel did an update, the app is telling me I can't use it for mobile deposits? I don't do very many a year, but hopefully Huntington will upgrade their software soon. Other than that it's great.....but please fix the mobile deposit portion soon!"

            "Well, this game is an amazing game ! , Very fun to play and draw and challenge other people . Now , the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it has too many ads ! , I mean c'mon , can't a person live without ads!?? , whenever I choose a character or try to click something , an ad comes! And every ad is of 20 seconds or so . Overall, everything is okay and fun. The reason why people have quit the game is because of the ads! , They are damn irritating .. AND I really hope they fix this .",
            "I am not the kind if person that gives bad reviews but this game seems more like a game for other ads or commercial for games. It is like they are making a business out if it. Too much ads. Also if I am drawing. I draw something so good but the thing doesn't do anything. Did your game. And if you want to get real money then reduce the commercials so it could be like a real game.",
            "This app is sooooooo ANOYING every time I finish a round my screen keeps coming back and I don't like it. It's very annoying. Overall, it's a very nice game, please fix the thing when the screen comes black after you finish a round , thank you.",
            "I love this app so much! It's very fun to play when you're waiting for something like your stop on a train or bus, since you can finish a round very quickly. Honestly, the large amount of ads don't bother me because I can exit the ad quite quickly, but less ads might be better."
