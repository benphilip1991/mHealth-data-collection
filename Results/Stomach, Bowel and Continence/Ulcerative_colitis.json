            "This is a really great idea, it has loads of tracking options that I just love. But it has some bugs that mean I can't retrospectively add things, for example if I go to bed exhausted and haven't remembered to track my dinner that evening, I can't add it the next day. It also doesn't allow me to add ingredients that are not included on its surprisingly restricted list of ingredients. Overall, wonderful idea but the execution needs work.",
            "The app does a decent job of tracking bowel movements, diet, and medicine. I have noted several issues and sent reports to the app developers. I have received no response. The preset medicine doses will sometimes double or quadruple in your queue and past medical history. I have on prescription that shows up eight times a day when I only take it once a day. Also if you add a duplicate food item you cannot delete it. And the ingredient options and search feature is extremely limited.",
            "Although this is a good app and it is headed in the right direction I find it not as easy or simple to use as other meal or health logging apps. I have my medications listed in the app but I'd like to be able to log if I have had them or not, it's handy to look back and see when I forgot my medication and how it affected me. I find the coloured backgrounds also make it harder to read. And I'd like to see more auto immune flammatory symptoms listed that are connected. E.g., sore back, dermatitis.",
            "Absolutely amazing, thank you so incredibly much for developing (& continuing to improve) this app...it has been a real game changer for me. I've tried many versions of food logs and wellness apps over the years but nothing compares to the insight I have gained through the easy and intuitive design of this application. Tracking my health doesn't feel like a chore anymore!!",
            "I use it to track my bowel movements everyday. It's very helpful for when I have doctors appointments or test/procedures done because when they ask how many times a day I go or about my bleeding and what not all the information is there on my phone and completely accurate because it's recorded. It's also nice because I can remember when I've had scopes or blood tests too because it also tracks that."

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",

It didn't even let me add symptoms apart from a questionnaire that was a one off rather than a daily tracker. Not for me I'm afraid.",
            "Poor - doesn't let you switch between apps as it loses your data. It doesn't include a food diary or detailed symptom log. Many hospitals aren't signed up. The symptoms that are listed are far too medical not everybody speaks the tongue of a doctor! It just seems like an NHS/ third party fishing trip for data, there are far better apps out there to use!"

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",

            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

This can be helpful in reducing symptoms for people with IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance and various other food intolerances, food sensitivities, and stomach problems.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Comprehensive list of foods and whether or not they are low FODMAP foods, to make finding foods that won't exacerbate your IBS easier.\r\n- Search by food name and category.\r\n- General FODMAP Diet and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and - \r\n- Lactose Intolerence and other food sensitivities info.\r\n- Additional details on the specific breakdowns of each food and whether it is high, medium, or low in the main categories of Polyols, Oligos, Fructose, and Lactose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Features Include:\r\nMy Experience - Log your personal experience with foods to determine if a food works for you regardless of its FODMAP content. Rate whether you had a good or bad reaction to a food after eating it, then leave detailed notes so that you know for next time how said food will affect you.\r\n\r\nCommunity Experience - See how the community has reacted to a food via anonymized My Experience ratings.

Once you've eliminated all high FODMAP foods from your diet, you can challenge foods to determine if they work for you.

Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage.

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "So at first I really liked the app. The tracking was easy, the graphs were helpful, and I liked that I could add my own symptoms to focus on what my specific issues were. But I ran into two deal killers for me.  1) you can't retroactively add bowel movements. Which is annoying because sometimes it's inconvenient to track it in the moment. Which leads to issue #2 2) I had a hard time accessing the tracking portion if I didn't have good cell reception. Bathrooms don't always have the best cell service so why I couldn't just track offline is beyond me. This wouldn't be a big problem if I could just log it later, but you can't.  It's a good app just didnt fit my desired style of use."

            "Does the job. No frills (even though it could use a few) I bought the app, which seemed priced appropriately for what it does. I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",
            "A simple app for logging meals, with a pleasing design. But there should be a way to set the time to 12H instead of 24H. For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",
            "The free version only gives you a 7 day history. I'm in the middle of unpleasant intolerance symptoms so seeing my logs is imperative and my health depends on it. I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",
            "I downloaded it for the symptoms too, but there isnt a calendar view, and it only records 7 days before asking for a lot of money. I had to uninstall.",
            "I use this to track my baby's symptoms as I am still breastfeeding and it works really well. I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event. The only thing I would love to see to improve it would be some sort of graph or chart as part of the report showing any patterns instead of having to read back through all of my entries to see if I can find any links."

            "I've had issues with my gallbladder since having an IUD removed 2 1/2 yrs ago. Been having a lot of pain the last few days, checked my symptoms to confirm if it was my gallbladder again. Turns out I need that and my appendix removed as soon as a date can be set. The app found what a gastroenterologist, allergist, pcp, and other specialists couldnt for over a yr. Many unnecessary procedures later, I will finally be back on the path to being healthy and active again."

            "In response to Plop😀 Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. 🙂",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

            "This app put a spotlight on my low energy problem, highlighting how low my daily fat and omega 3 intake was. Really surprised me, but it was spot on. I feel incredible now, workouts feel better, can challenge myself now in a really good way. The app has a lot of intuitive features that keep pushing me (almost unconsciously) to good, nutrient dense foods to meet those targets. Love it.",
            "This is such a cool app for tracking nutrition intake! I was surprised to learn my calcium and magnesium intakes were consistently low. Made it easy to correct a deficit I would never have dreamed I had. Reports are easily customized. U-tube how-to's & free webinars make it easy to learn. Gold membership is a great value.",
            "Easy fix and it's be 5! It took me 3 tried to find out why it said \"invalid data\" when I wanted to create a meal. Turns out your app doesn't allow the emoticons. I was trying to use the turkey. I like colors and images so something like that is more pleasing for me. Makes keeping track \"fun\". My planner has different colors and stickers just for support. I look at a crazy week and can smile. I'm weird. Love your app tho!!",
            "I'm finding this app so useful for tracking nutrition. I have had to go on a low carbohydrate diet and I can see at a glance the net carbs and proportions of other macros to make sure I'm on track. I also love that I can check all the vitamins and minerals as well as the foods that will supply them if any are low. Excellent 🙂",
            "Counts calories and shows key nutrients! I love how you can add your own foods and there are many preavailable to save you time. And being able to see your key nutrient daily values met is wonderful. Only thing to tweak is being able to see all your minerals you've gotten from what you ate. You can only see all the mineral percentages % from individual foods eaten. But wonderful to track calories and nutrients overall!"

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

            "This app put a spotlight on my low energy problem, highlighting how low my daily fat and omega 3 intake was. Really surprised me, but it was spot on. I feel incredible now, workouts feel better, can challenge myself now in a really good way. The app has a lot of intuitive features that keep pushing me (almost unconsciously) to good, nutrient dense foods to meet those targets. Love it.",
            "This is such a cool app for tracking nutrition intake! I was surprised to learn my calcium and magnesium intakes were consistently low. Made it easy to correct a deficit I would never have dreamed I had. Reports are easily customized. U-tube how-to's & free webinars make it easy to learn. Gold membership is a great value.",
            "Easy fix and it's be 5! It took me 3 tried to find out why it said \"invalid data\" when I wanted to create a meal. Turns out your app doesn't allow the emoticons. I was trying to use the turkey. I like colors and images so something like that is more pleasing for me. Makes keeping track \"fun\". My planner has different colors and stickers just for support. I look at a crazy week and can smile. I'm weird. Love your app tho!!",
            "I'm finding this app so useful for tracking nutrition. I have had to go on a low carbohydrate diet and I can see at a glance the net carbs and proportions of other macros to make sure I'm on track. I also love that I can check all the vitamins and minerals as well as the foods that will supply them if any are low. Excellent 🙂",
            "Counts calories and shows key nutrients! I love how you can add your own foods and there are many preavailable to save you time. And being able to see your key nutrient daily values met is wonderful. Only thing to tweak is being able to see all your minerals you've gotten from what you ate. You can only see all the mineral percentages % from individual foods eaten. But wonderful to track calories and nutrients overall!"

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Constipation Guide, Constipation Disease Management & Constipation Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Constipation Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

I feel so disappointed and honestly, kind of betrayed. Goodbye Zemedy, there's no way I pay that much, even though the app is (was...) excellent.",

            "This app was amazing but since the update it no longer works consistently i had no problems with the old version. I would go without the new look to have it function properly",
            "This app was exactly what I was looking for. Until it kept crashing and now won't even open. Very disappointed. I loved being able to track symptoms with time frames, notes, dates and how severe the symptoms were. Perfect for my upcoming Dr. Appointment. I loved how I was able to add which days I took medicine as well. But now I'm unable to use it and have to uninstall because of the constant crashing.",
            "previously rated this app 4 stars. I've had to downgrade that because I upgraded phones, and there doesn't seem to be anyway to keep that data. :-( Downgrading again bc suddenly it crashes every time I try to add a symptom. I cannot access my symptom log.",
            "Omg the app I was looking for! Tried many more but this one is simple, easy to use and lets me describe what is going on. (Symptoms and background info...weather, activity, anything affecting symptoms!) So far so good. Thanks! My only suggestion would be for the time frame ( morning, afternoon, evening) to be able to include more than one time frame ( ie: morning and afternoon) or to have an \"all day\" option My symptoms often last 12 or more hours.",
            "Wish I knew where my notes went after not using it for a few months my data is gone."

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "In general, a really good app with lots of functionality. It would be nice if the font stood out more. I feel like I'm always squinting at the screen. Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",
            "I love this program however, the update 2 days ago messed up typing on the community boards. You can't see what u type. Others are having the same issue too. Help!!!",
            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

            "I like your app but it's very limited and one thing that could really help it is to have the option of scanning barcodes of your food like can be done with the myfitnessapp. Theres alot of good and bad with that app but the good outweighs the bad which...isnt the case with this app. Sorry hate be a buzz kill but it definitely needs a major remodel.",
            "Not easy to use. You can't copy items from one meal to another. You can't create your own recipes to make it easier to track meals. It has been crashing when I try to add in my weight so I can't track progress in the program. Overall very disappointed.",
            "Only lets you record macros, need $$pro$$ version to record micros, what a shame. liked the layout and all but charging extra to record micros is greedy. Coding in the extra micros is not difficult nor time consuming, shame on the app developers.",
            "The app itself is great but the database of food is extremely limited. I have to create my custom food all the time especially when 99% the scanner can't find the food even those are common in the local supermarket",
            "This app has wide range of food entrees, which makes it easy to track. I also like the tracking of water, nutrients and log exercise and steps."

            "I tried putting in my weight, and while it shows \"kg\" as the measurement, when you look at the log, it shows \"lb\". Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",
            "This app is great. Tracks a ton of information I can share with my doctor. Quick.  Easy. Love the reports and notes features."

            "In general this app is helpful. I have one objection - too much focus on disease! A passage that could say, \"to keep your kidneys healthy avoid theses foods\" starts out with this ramble - \"If you have bad kidneys\" \"There are many risk factors for kidney disease\" and just goes on and on planting disease, disease, disease. Do you think you could make the focus and suggestions move in the direction of healthy kidneys...?",
            "I am very disappointed with this so called app.This book really doesn't cover anything except kidney stones and that is anecdotal at best! Forget trying to find out about anything else. In an immature manner benefiting no one but a complete moron, the language of this app is degrading. The sections described only briefly the diseases. Barely covered (if at all) are various ailments of the kidneys. Even if a disease or condition is mentioned, what is said about it is minimal. This app even suggests that kidney disease can be cured which is not the case. Kidney damage is permanent and if severe enough will lead to dialysis or total kidney failure. I think I am giving this app two stars out of the kindness of my heart. I would not recommend this app to anyone except an elementary school student of middle grade.",

            "I have to use this app and practice the natural way to keep my and my familys kidneys healthy. My better half had a kidney transplant, it was eye opening to see how many people are suffering from kidney disease. if you can keep your kidneys healthy now, you are saving yourself/loved one from 30 hours a week in a dialysis clinic. It's unimaginable how many people are in some state of kidney failure. We need to prevent this disease becoming our future. Start here naturally ♡",

            "This app ticks all the boxes for me for a weight tracking app (I've tried many). It has a decent barcode scanner and a reasonably well curated database, option to save meals and recipes, and a breakdown of macronutrients you consumed in the free subscription. It doesn't try to solve all the world's problems and do it poorly. That's impressively hard to find! I also like the UI, it's pretty, intuitive and uncluttered.",
            "Really love this app. I have used it for a month with no problems, but today I can't go to my goals without the app shutting down. Please fix this! Until today I would have given 5 stars. I've reported problem but haven't heard a response yet.",
            "Bugs fixed. I'd like to add that the year subscription is totally worth it. When paired with GoogleFit I have lost 25 lbs in three months. App holds you 100% accountable when no one else can, if you cheat you cheat yourself out of weight loss. Follow your plan , exceed your goals and the weight will fall off. By the time you realize it it is already a habit and you are accounting for everything u consume. The app will inform u of the areas that need improvement.",
            "Most nutritional information in this app is incorrect. For example, items like calories, carbohydrates and proteins are not always correct and in fact very can be far off. Where my actual carbohydrates are 180g, this app will tell me they are only 130g. This may have something to do with the fact that anyone can go in and adjust nutritional information. The app would be great otherwise but I cannot continue to use it or refer my clients because of the abundant false nutritional information.",
            "Two updates now and calories still do not change when weight changes. I have emailed support, but I guess the engineers just don't care that their app does not work properly. Not sure what their focus is within the app, but they sure are not good a fixing things they screw up thats for sure. I given up on emailing. Seems to be a huge waste of time."

For what you are really looking for. It's availability is very helpful when you want to find the vitamins and minerals you wany it is right there at the touch of a botton. It is very helpful and time saving whenever yo need it.",
            "Excellent app!! Loved how efficient and helpful it is. The food suggestions are so useful. It's an all in one app that helps identify my deficiency and suggests an all natural way to correct it. Really exceptional!",
            "I love this app! I think there is more scoring emphasis on vitamin deficiency vs mineral deficiency though...I also wish there was a related app that would explain potentially why the deficiencies if you are supplementing with there already",
            "I'm quite sure that this app saved my life. For the last year and a half, my health declined to the point that I was bedridden over 95% of the time. Doctors couldn't figure it out and neither could I, despite being a scientist and reading nutritional research as a serious hobby for a couple of decades. In the app, you enter symptoms, and then it will ask a series of questions to narrow things down. This is pure genius- it asked things I had going on and would not have thought to put together. They also cut across medical specialities if the issue could include nutrients that are important for several functions. This app let me know that I was highly likely to be deficient in a particular micronutrient, and possibly a second one. The app then gives a list of foods to get that nutrient (it was only showing a list for one food per query). I went with a supplement to correct this, and within hours I started improving- not a placebo effect, swelling was going down and energy, up! In a few days I was able to do chores that I hadn't been able to do in ages. Thyroid hormone levels are recovering, too! This app is new enough that it can be a bit glitchy when you start up, and it would be nice if in the future the list of foods included how much of the nutrient each of them contain, and give a list for each nutrient identified in the report. At the moment, without that, you can at least look over the list of recommendations & that helps. I saw that I hadn't been including those foods for years (work injury destroyed income & former, more varied diet) so it seemed reasonable that I'd be depleted. It would also be a nice improvement if they were to give info on the correct form for a supplement. Though it emphasizes getting nutrition through diet, that isn't always possible, and bioavailability matters. I highly recommend this app. If you use iOS, you must wait. I tried to get it for someone else and we were unable to get it through either play store for her iPhone. I'll be doing the updates, and again must point out that as it is, this app can already be a life-saver.",

And it was like every day there was something new to find out. Love it!!",

            "This is an amazing app. It literally tells u all kinds of home made natural remedies and recipes u can use or make to use. For me, I've been having trouble with acne and it gave me a huge list with good detailing on what I need, and how to use it, and how to make it. It's not just for acne though. Upset stomach, in general just wanting to b healthy. It's a great app. At least for me it is. It's worth it to check out if ur into stuff like this",
            "The site is amazing from A to Z and then some. It goes far beyond my expectations, especially considering it's free! It's a plethora of information ! Not to mention the advertisements are minimal and not intrusive ! 100% recommend this app"

            "Good feature set, but pretty much useless for anything except tracking period and symptoms if you are not temping: even with clear cervical fluid patterns, it will not estimate when ovulation happened on a particular past month. Edit: thank you for your quick answer! Yes, I know cervical fluid is not enough information to compute the ovulation day, but I would expect a sort of estimate like \"based on your inputs, ovulation might have happened on CD x\".",

            "What a terrible app. There's more screen space dedicated to premium pushing ads than the chart! It continiously tells me I might be pregnant, even in the middle of my period (and, as someone going through fertility treatment, it's made me cry twice because the ads push that I would be pregnant if I had just bought premium), it has no algorithm to adapt to cycles and is stuck on an insane 20 day cycle, and the UI hasn't been updated since the 90s."

            "I didnt know why i couldnt gain weight since i am currently 20lbs under a healthy bmi. I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",
            "I've only started using this app but so far I'm impressed. Eating healthy and losing weight is difficult for me but this app is a great guide to track progress.",
            "So far its very easy to follow, free and provides good advice. I think if you upgrade they provide more advice."

            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",

            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

If you're using the website, log in there with same password. Then sync if you'd like: option is in both the app & the website. It all works fine.",

            "Ads are pretty pervasive. There is usually an ad after every action. If I enter breakfast with 3 items, my action is delayed after each item. I would go to the premium but the option to purchase once yearly is not offered and must be debited monthly. (Not something I can do.) Thank you. I will try that. I did as suggested but the app will not let me enter foods, etc. It will not accept my goals entry. For two days I've gotten a msg asking me to connect. However, my phone is connected to the net",

I won't be continuing with this app.",

Think the portions need to be more flexible as 1 serving of raw food like sliced onions hard to judge if it's a portion or not. Just a small gripe tho",

            "Great data base, but few bugs. Like the barcode that won't work until rebooting the app and the today's planning that get all empty when starting the app. Also it's just an historic of my meals, it would be great to prepare them in advance for the coming weeks.",
            "I'm pretty new to be rating this app, but I like what it is bringing to the table. I'm using the premium version and thought the price was low enough to pick up the extra features of menus and advice. Content is very helpful. Taking a photo and getting feedback is innovative and I think will be stronger as more people use. Having issues with font size in database being a bit large to see full descriptions. Seeing a lot of potential!",
            "Unless you're sure you want to pay for the whole year, go ahead with the supposedly \"7-day Free trial\". They will charge you at the moment of the subscription to the trial. I contacted Foodvisor support and Play Google, and neither validated my complaint. It is highly deceiving for users to tell they can try the app but charge them the full amount right away. I don't know how Google allows this type of practice."

            "I love this app it tells me what day i should start and I've done that each time. My only issue was this last period lasted 13 days and i had to restart my period twice even tho I hadn't selected that my period had ended yet, there should be a way to fix that so you don't have to restart and make notes. My other thing was when you say you've been intimate you have 3 positions to choose from but it only let's you choose one, could you please fix that also? Other than that I've been very satisfied",
            "Overall has been a hugely helpful app. My one beef is if I'm trying to remove the pregnancy setting and accidentally choose \"miscarriage\" as the reason I can't go back and fix it. There is no setting to remove the miscarriage note, which affects the app's ability to continue predicting my fertility cycle. I would like to be able to remove pregnancy notes, please and thank you.",
            "I have this app with my partner, her app works well. My app runs in 'partner mode' and hasn't updated in a long time. According to my app she is 145 days late, as she is not 4 months pregnant I believe the app may be malfunctioning. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, this has not helped. The settings button on the interface is unresponsive. Great idea for an app, poor final product.",
            "I enjoy the free portion of the app but recently my widget has stopped working. I checked for and update but there isnt one. I have to delete the widget and replace it everyday to fix it and it defeats the purpose of me using the widget. The widget worked fine the first month or so. The app seems to keep everything together well and I would upgrade for the charts but I would prefer a cheaper subscription for just the charts only. Thanks for the app! I hope the widget issue is fixed soon.",
            "This app helps a lot to keep track. I don't have to try to remember when I'm going to start, when my last menstrual started, helps when I'm going to ovulate and many other things. I would give 5 stars if the app was still completely free."

So when you go to your Dermatology appointment and they ask you if you've noticed a mole before, you'll be able to say \"yes!\", and they won't need to do a $300 biopsy if you're not sure of the duration of mole existence.",

This is not 1993 and email sharing is not most convenient. 2. Sharing images is not an indication to skip a doctor. You are trying to cover product limitation with false concerns but is actually sounds patronising."

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

I can login on the website, but the app says it's invalid. I tried resetting my password in the app. After inputting my email to reset I get the error \"There was a problem...\". Yeah, no kidding. While I can see the pollen rating for the day with the widget, the rest of the app is useless.",
            "I used to really like this app. Since the Covid pandemic, I feel that this app has missed the accuracy for many months. I've had this app for years and I have never seen this before. Just wish we knew why it's changed so much. If I'm wrong, I apologize, but it just doesn't seem to be the same as it was. Watch the prediction and see how far it is almost every day.",
            "This app is not at all accurate. Its pollen level readings do not jibe with the readings that are given on the local TV weather forecasts, and with most people's allergy symptoms. For example, now in mid October at this location we are having high levels of ragweed and mountain cedar (juniper) pollen, but the app shows the levels as very low, 0.8 or lower. This app not useful.",
            "I have now been able to download and use the app. It works fine. I do wish I did not have to keep going online to get the info everytime I turn off the phone to charge it. Other than this I thank you for making it available.",

Widget has several options to customise :) -easy to use, customise cup size, daily goal.. can also have \"standard\" goals based on gender, weight, active lifestyle -achievements for motivation Suits me very well :) Would love integration to GoogleFit or MyFitnessPal :)",
            "Real simple and easy water tracker. Appreciate the ability to customize the water size and the widget is super useful to access from my home screen. The notification helpfully has the ability to add water from the pop up, but I wish it wouldn't open the app up automatically when you click it. It would make things easier if you could just add water from the notification when it comes up, then continue without interruption. but besides that, it's useful and practical.",
            "Good, helps and always reminds me to drink water. I do have a suggestion for the widgets though, can you make them add an amount of water to your daily goal without opening the app? The widgets are kind of just a display of your intakes but isn't really that functional. Also please make it able to write your water intake the previous days, because I just installed the app but it doesn't let me because I have not installed the app in those days yet.",
            "I am a water drinker everyday all day long and my doctor told me I was drowning my organs due to the amount of water I was consuming. This app helps me keep track of my intake that I show my doctors. Great app",
            "I like this app a lot because the app will remind you to bring the water I think you will install the app and you guys can decide the notification sound I think you will install this app install and great the app thank you but first I am telling you one thing when you do not get notifications you can comment in the Google Play store and they will tell you what to do one time I just get like that problem then i tell them they solve it ok bye my dear friends ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺"

            "I purchased the premium version only to find out it doesn't sync with my Samsung active 2 or samsung health It's a decent app to track your macros which I was doing fine in the free version. The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",
            "This is the app you want to get if you are going to go on a keto diet. I liked it so much I bought the paid version. It has helped me lose 76 pounds and still losing weight. Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",
            "Love this tracker it is beyond easy and intuitive. Save recipes, copy anything to any day you want. Scan barcodes. Set up meal reminders and anything else you might need in a simple easy to read design. I \"WAS\" using 'my fitness pal' but seriously Carb Manager gives for free what MFP wanted me to pay $50 a year for.... CM is the best and I recommend it to everyone on keto or not because it's just that amazing to use & you DON'T need to pay!!"

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one. Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

            "Noom puts the \"fun\" in \"functional\" plus it's easy to use! This app has short, informative articles that always make me chuckle. I lost weight right away during the 14-day trial, now I'm signed up for the next three months! This isn't like any other wellness app... you gotta try it for yourself to see just what I love about Noom. Totally worth it!!",
            "Originally thought I was getting my money's worth. But now they removed their built-in pedometer (which is the only device/app I was using) and they also removed the GPS tracking for when you do a workout and you want to know the distance you went (walk, hike, bike, etc). Very disappointed. I can't even accurately track my exercice anymore with this latest update they did! How am I supposed to figure out the distance I just hiked in order to punch it in manually? Ridiculous update.",
            "I absolutely love Noom! I've never had so much fun and success loosing weight! I love the tracking calories and seeing how many I have left, all the information they give you every day and the fun way they explain it, the coach, the group interaction! This is for me. I'm going to sign up my daughter too. I've only lost 9 pounds so far, but I know I'll stick with it and loose the rest ( unlike other diets) because I'm really enjoying it and learning so much. I love Noom!",
            "I absolutely love this! You learn how to eat better, and eat less. Noom helps you to be accountable for everything from nutrition to fitness! It is also motivational and you have a personal coach to help you along the way. You set realistic long term and short term goals for yourself. One thing that surprised me was I've always been a healthy eater, but with noom I realized I was eating way too dense. So far Ive lost 5 lbs and its the first week! If you put in the work, youll see results!",
            "So far mostly ok. Two main complaints: 1. Step tracking. Originally I set it up to sync with Fitbit and adjust goals daily, but it wasn't working so I tried to remove the link to Fitbit but now it only lets me choose a different app. I just want to log steps manually. 2. Why do they have you add on a meal plan and exercise plan but NOT have those integrated into the app? If I'd known in advance these would be just emailed to me and not really part of the program I wouldn't have gotten them."

            "Very handy app. I use it everyday to track calories and nutrients. Would really, really like to see the option to use NET CARBS as the daily total carbs. That would be very useful to me. Love, love, love the bar-code scanning feature. I think some sort of organizational options for MY FOODS would also be helpful (folders? groups? sorting?) Scrolling through an unordered list of many items is pretty laborious. Overall, it's a very valuable tool to me.",
            "I started using this app on mid March and by mid October, I had lost a total of 13 pounds. It calculates the amount of calories you should consume based on your weight and height. It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",
            "Love this app! Tracks food, water intake, fitness and so much more. But my favorite feature is that you can scan most products and it will input for you. You can adjust amounts, if necessary. It has a community and other nice features. I am now asking myself why was I paying for a program (starts with a \"n\"). A youtuber (Kimberly Hooks) recommended it to me so now I am recommending it as well.",
            "I've used this app on and off, logging calories or just tracking food. I love it personally because the design is simple and aesthetically pleasing, adding your own foods and nutrition info is easy, and the bar code scanner is convenient for packaged foods.",
            "The only thing I would change is the ability to add foods not in the library with info that I have. Example Dreamfield Pastas I appreciate the correction. Found it, tried it, loved it. Really helping me. It was suggested by my doctor."

When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",
            "Changed a new phone & photos keep rotating when being added. Phone model is Samsung Galaxy A51"

My baby is now a few months old and I can honestly say that there have been very few days when I haven't opened the app. The availability of advice from the pros and from other mothers is so helpful especially when you're stuck in a rut not knowing what to do/think as a parent/parent-to-be. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I'd be lost without it. Well done to the creators.",
            "This app is Brilliant! I have been suffering from morning sickness for 10 weeks now. Forever being sick. Especially in the morning! Then I downloaded this app and had a good look! It has gave me advice i haven't found else where and for the first day. I haven't been sick! I am so grateful for this app. Its videos for every week are to die for 🥰😍",
            "So I do really really like this App for get me wrong, the only thing that I feel is missing is a symptom tracker, and appointment reminders. Things that I did see other apps offer but I personally did not like the community in those apps as much as this one. So for that I give 4 stars if there as an update later on I will gladly change my review to 5 stars and will happily promote this app to my trying friends.",
            "Love this app, it has so much info to offer and it's so helpful. I'll even google questions and the answer will sometimes pop up in this app which is really beneficial. It has a great support system as well to help you along you journey. It shows you week by week how your baby is growing and just so much information I highly recommend!",
            "This is my favourite pregnancy tracker. It's like watching baby grow week to week. You can connect with other expectant moms. There are lots of helpful tips and articles on diet, relationships, and more. I have recommended it to my friends."

Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",

            "I'm glad I only installed the free version. I'm new to avoiding gluten and very few of my foods I have in my house even show up. The suggested or related foods are always some expensive wholefoods brands. I just want an app that can tell me what foods I normally eat are safe and what I need to find alternative gluten free products for. Not very helpful.",

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "Really like this app except that it won't let me sign in on multiple devices. I am not the only person who cares for my baby so I need my husband to also have access. I emailed about it a few days ago but haven't heard anything back...",
            "Nice app but now it is not saving my manual pumping data that I input",
            "In trying to be as objective as possible, this app is terrible. It constantly logs you out, then does not accept your password, then you must go through a reset password - all while trying to pump/breastfeed. In addition to not allowing me to log in being a reoccurring issue, I also found several times that my pump session was not stored. While its possible the first few times it could be user error, but since the early days I make it a point to talk out all the steps to make sure I've entered and saved everything correctly. I have not been able to log back in from my phone, and am now using the app through my laptop - which doesn't appear to allow you to log your pumping/breastfeeding sessions. I'm actually looking for an alternate app, because the Medela app is triggered my anxiety far too many times. At this point, my only objective with this app is to (if I'm finally able to log back in from my phone) extract my data. Obviously it cannot be a password issue on my end, if I'm able to login from my computer.",
            "**Since the update things have been going great again! Just wish there was some end user customization available to make being an EP easier. Used to be a good app, now its logged me out and saying I have connection issues which is false as I'm on my wifi now for this review. ALL of my EP sessions are logged in the app and now I can't calculate where I'm at to know what stock I have on hand and I'm hoping to stop pumping soon if I have enough.",
            "It tracks items very well when it works. I get frequent log-outs which is inconvenient when I'm just about to start breastfeeding - it's not like I can tell my baby \"you have to wait\". Also, this past week I'm getting \"no internet connection\" when I am connected - everything else open on my phone is connected but this app suddenly shows \"no internet connection\"."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This app is fine for typically developing kids. I wish there were places to indicate special needs and modified developmental needs. To my knowledge, there aren't alternative developmental milestone charts even available. Which is really frustrating, for example of course my blind child is not pointing at pictures of the animals in books. But, there's no alternative Milestone checklist available for her. So, this really wasn't very useful for our family as most of our children have special needs",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I had a few glitches with this app, notably when casting to the tv. I like the routines but was dissatisfied that some of the workout classes you couldn't save to use again - apologies if you can, I couldn't work out how! The other issue I had is that like most other apps there is a lot of squat exercises, not good for me, and an alternative is often tricky to find. Sad that so much is only available to subscribers, I haven't renewed for the above reasons, and I'm not interested in the meal plan",
            "I like the classes, but feel sad about not having them available on the weekends. The workouts are good too, but I am still trying to figure out how to create a routine for the week / month, that is complete and balanced. I found this app is not very good at providing that. The previous app I had was very good at setting up a 3 month program and I did not have to figure out what to do everyday, plus I felt I was working towards a more clear and oriented goal.",
            "Great app! Changed my life :) got addicted to online workouts.. Good diversity, awsome trainers, you can choose the workout level and type easily. Highly recommended!!",
            "I've tried alot of apps to help motivate and hold me accountable and 8fit is the only one that has worked for ME! I love that it starts your work outs at the level your at. It has alarms, recipes, and I can log my daily work outs to hold myself accountable. I use the free version right now but will upgrade when I reach my first weight loss goal!",
            "I enjoy this app. It's good for keeping my workouts on a schedule and helps me stay motivated. I can track not just the guided workouts I've done through the app, but also the workouts I do elsewhere. I'm not even using the premium version, either. I likely will get it, though! The classes it offers look good, and being able to access recipes would be great."

I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.)

Would be nice to have a ML/oz, gram etc calculator. Thanks for the app as is however its really great. Best to your team. Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

Needless to say carving out the time for a full fitness routine is a struggle. Thankfully Centr takes care of all the planning and tells you EXACTLY what to do and how to do it with an incredibly easy to use interface. They even get your kids involved with some of the activities. I've been at it 30 days now and def notice an improvement in muscle gain and overall health.",
            "I thought that this app was a great way for me to try and bulk up my body. Definitely made me feel like I was striving for a new me. I only wish that this app would track your weight and do some before and after photos. Or it could definitely make some monthly or weekly progress notifications. Other than that. This app is definitely great. 👍",
            "Totally recommend a subscription. There are SO many workouts to choose from with various levels of strength/endurance. I love that you can see how long the workout is and for many of the programs, you can see what exercises yoy will be doing ahead of time. Includes recipes too. Great value.",
            "Excellent app. I'm not fit and I keep up with every exercises. Many different level options. Entertaining and fun coaches. I recommend it!",
            "This app has great workouts and I have found the coached workouts are easy to follow. The recipes are fairly easy to follow and its improved my breakfast game. The reason it doesn't get five stars is because it's really lacking in personalization. It doesn't help you tract your weight or personalize the meal plan to your height/weight/gender/activity level. As is, the meal plan portion of the app is highly lacking for what you pay for the app. I do really love the workouts though."

            "I honestly love this app. I have used in on and off for years. I recently started using this app again this year. I have been trying to register an account with Mango, but each time I try it gives me an error of \"registration unavailable\" - every time. So 4 stars. I also wish you could add your own habits to the app. Like a custom habit that you could edit, and congifure to fit your needs. I use other apps for habits I can't track in Mango. Would be nice to be able to track it all in one place.",
            "It is great for putting your meds in and keeping track with what you eat. What it does not do is take into consideration not ALL people are glued to their phones to add the information in when it wants it. Yes you can add it in later but does not give you your points. As well as not being linked to other apps like my Samsung watch which keeps track of my steps and this app does not even register 1 step and again does not give me points. How about calories since your tracking food?",
            "This is my go to app to input my health information. It would be nice if it would connect to other apps like Fitbit, Garmin, Onetouch for glucose monitor results so i only have to input in one app and Mango picks it up. Also would be nice if reminders can be adjusted based on weekdays or weekends. I wear my watch to bed to monitor sleep and my watch buzzes at 6am on weekends because I have it programmed for 6am on weekdays.",
            "This app really pushes you to take your medication and other healthy habits of your choice. I've only used this for 2 days now but I already appreciate how helpful it is. I love the leveling system and the rewards you can get the more you stay on track. A+ app in my book. :)",
            "Have not received a reminder notification for the last 4 days. All notifications are turned on and had been working, although it had been messing up randomly prior to last update. Not useful to me anymore without the reminders."

            "I love that this teaches mindful, intuitive eating and not dieting/ restricting. It really helps me to slow down and listen to my body. I am very impressed with this app! I also love the meditations 🧘‍♀️",
            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",
            "Excellent tool. Keep up the exceptional work! It has been very useful to me and made the process very positive. Thank you!"

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "I like this app because I can go back and show my husband and doctors how much water I am taking in and in what \"form\" (coffee, tea, etc). The only thing that I really don't like is that I want to 'Go Pro' and it lists the price but not how often needs to be paid. Is it weekly? Monthly? 'Yearly'? Frustrating.",
            "The app is very intuitive, and there's a lot of great features that help you keep track of your water usage. 10 out of 10 would recommend, just for the health usage. One thing I would like to see is the integration for me to use this with my iOS phone as well, with my premium features without buying another one. But I'm just nitpicking at this point.",
            "I bought this app because I loved it, but some glitch has happened. I've been meeting my target of 3 litres a day for almost 200 days straight. All of a sudden, a random two days are in red. When I view them in my diary, it shows I've surpassed the amount I should have. But in the statistics, it's red and shows it happens. I had to go to those two days and add two more litres each just to fix my statistics. I don't know why this happened. The diary doesn't match the statistics.",
            "I like this app because unlike other water reminder I used to use , there are more features for tracking and reminding. But what actually made use this app is the feature where you can challenge your friends and family on daily intake of water with help of a dashboard. Happy with the app",
            "used to work correctly and now I have a completely white field in the constant notification upd: thanks for answering. I stopped using it for a day and put it back, now it's working again. but I will send an email with the screenshot nevertheless."

            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

            "It's simple and I'm happy. I love the simple tracking, nothing fancy, no creating an account just to pay for premium nonsense. It's super easy to log items in and even the scanner is quick and painless. Warning though, it makes a loud beep sound when the scan is complete but my phone is usually on silence.",
            "Really great at minus one major flaw. When creating your own recipe there isn't an option to scan the barcode of the food you are entering. Because of this I don't think when the macros are accurate when creating your own recipe.",
            "This is actually a pretty good tracker. I've tried a few and this one is more simple and easier. I am pleased at how straight forward adding info is. Set your daily calorie needs (ex:1200-1300 for me), add your foods consumed in the search bar by name of food or brand and tweek amounts if needed to get calories consumed. Then add what ever activity or exercise you've done to approximate calories burned and it gives you a daily journal. I like it. There arent any ads. That's a plus! 👍",
            "This is the best app I've ever used so far! I have searched for this type of app for a long time and i was always disapointed. The nutritional facts are acurate, you can track your progress and calories realy easy, make recipes, check your calories loss during workout... this app is truly amazing for me!"

And you can always research more after finding what plant works for what in this app! 💚💚💚 I also love the added feature of relaxation where it will play soft forest or river sounds for 10min! And I still have to keep exploring it, but it's really nice and user friendly!",

I hope you can expand the app more (more herbs and diseases it can cure, maybe even how to plant these herbs, and how to use them) it's a lot to ask from me, I know 😂😂😂 But I'm sure doing so will result in this app becoming more popular as I'm already in love with this simply organized version 😍😍😍 Thanks a lot! Keep improving 🥺🥺🥺",

It would be 5* but I find the UI a bit tricky to navigate, but it's not too bad.",

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

            "Good app in general, makes things easy to remember and to you can keep all of the pet's info in one place. The one thing I would love to see improved is the schedule notifications. It's confusing as you open it to confirm that you have done something (ie: given meds at the right time) but you can't click \"done\" there and then as it takes you to a future repeat instead of the one you want.",
            "I use this app to track my pets' medications and grooming. It is awesome. Also, their support staff is very responsive to feedback, and the app has only gotten better over the year or so that I have been using it.",
            "I find it very usefull and it helps me a lot not to forget the monthly medications of my dog. However, I did not find option to fill out dog's pregnancy and to set an alarm for the expected period of delivery. It would be nice to have this added as an feature.",
            "It would be great app if reminders were working. I have set medication cycles but no notification comes up when its due. I also changed it to be alarm and use system alarm, but nothing here, too. Also \"feedback and suggestions\" link is just opening sharing screen and not some contact form. Failed to upload picture from both camera or gallery, sent the error reports. Blog and Help sections are just giving me \"failed to connect wifi\" although the app is syncing without problems. (Pixel 3)",
            "What an amazing app! I've had pets for over 25 years, but on getting a new smartphone was looking for something exactly like this to keep track of things. It is feature-rich, easy to use and with great support. Thank you for developing it. 🤠 Edit... I have used this app for some months now and I've come to the conclusion that it is just far too complicated to use! Everytime I go to do something simple it is not intuitive to use."

The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

I stand by everything I said earlier in my first review, but PLEAZE bring back the vit D box &above all THE FULL SCREEN SUN BURST!!",

            "My daughter loves this app because she loves trying to get the stars to decorate her 5 rooms. Well, she's earned enough to get every single item in each room, and currently has 81 stars. She is anxious to have more rooms or decorations. I emailed you guys ages ago asking if/when you would be updating, and never received a response. She's been asking me daily for three weeks if I've heard from Budd. I'm giving you only two stars for the lack of response.",
            "All 3 of my kids' accounts are glitching: not giving all stars, not opening new rooms when first 2 are complete, and not even letting my daughter login at all. But brushing and attitude have improved even in the incredibly short time the app worked.",
            "Edit: Seems the devs fixed it Good app but not supported anymore it seems. Email support never answers back so you're stuck. In my case I want to transfer the app to another identical phone (1st one broke). But it doesn't work. I'm even on the paid subscription!!! Otherwise it's a well designed app for kids - mine LOVES it. Annoying to adults but we're not the audience here. The video recording & playback, quizzes, AR, etc.are well thought out and implemented. I just wish they still had support.",
            "My son really enjoys this app. It makes him slow down & pay attention to where & how he's brushing. My son can watch how he's brushing and compare to the character. The app takes pics during the brushing process. After brushing is done the child matches his/her pic with the character. If matched correctly, points are earned to \"purchase\" decorations for their bathroom w/ in the game. My only negative opinion would be not having the child brush their tongue. I REALLY wish they would add that.",
            "A game that teaches good brushing techniques AND rewards a child's efforts! I tried every toothbrushing game out there, and this is the only one that teaches to brush all parts of the teeth and lasts at least the 2 minute recommended brushing time. It's fun and gives rewards at the end. Almost perfect. It needs to include brushing the tongue. It also needs to spend more time on the biting surfaces, as those are the most important to brush."

            "Seriously, I've been trying to set it up for the first day of my challenge and in less than 12 hours it's booted me out mid way with a variety of errors - told me the app wasn't available in my country, then decided my login was wrong, then worked for 20min, now down for maintenance??? Guys, if you want people to rely on this app you need to create something reliable. I'd much prefer if you sent out the calendar and shake/cleanse day schedules on paper along with the order like you used to.",
            "Real buggy. Takes ages to load. Won't allow change of daily schedule start time. Won't upload photos from phone library without errors. Update: Latest bug - permits adding to autoship, but doesn't allow deleting. When such a high premium on product, you'd expect more spend on development of a robust app platform.",
            "The app keeps crashing every two seconds and closing out. I can even look at the other info or products available without an issue.",
            "What this app can do is very helpful if it could just stop kicking me out. I spend more time trying to sign back in then actually tracking.",
            "I wish this app was compatible with more devices. I want to be able to use my Amazon fire tablet to track as well. I also wish it could sync with the Samsung health app."

            "This is a great app I have been tracking my food intake for almost 2 months and i have lost over 2 stone.x",
            "Really like being able to record what foods I eat and also be able to write notes for my symptoms afterwards. I've just been diagnosed with IBD so trying to find trigger foods. I like that I can still navigate the app for free and I LOVE that it reminds me after each meal to record my intake. The most common foss are \"locked\" to prompt you to purchase the app with a monthly fee, but they do allow you to free write what you eat. For my purposes, this app works for me. But if I we're trying to track calories, this free app is not ideal.",
            "I had the premium version of this app on my W10 phone and was initially pleased to see it here when I moved to Android. Whilst the bones of the app are the same (though no dark mode, unfortunately), the cost of buying/subscribing to the app is too high. I can put up with banner ads and am happy to add my own food details, but the update on March 6th has added full page video ads that you have to watch for 5secs before you can skip. I had 2 of them in 1 session, that kills the app for me."

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important.

            "Helps me keep track of when my period weeks are, which my birth control already basically does with the placebo week. I loved this app before it updated to what it is now. Now it is hard to use, it erased my data at one point, and just really doesn't work as well as it used to. Now that I have a new phone, I wanted to sign up for an account to save my data from my old phone, but it keeps giving an error and not telling me if there's even anything that I need to fix to make it work. Honestly just wish they'd roll back the app to what it was. :/",
            "Still not happy with current layout. Why would you update to a less intuitive interface? Edit: Is there a plan to update again? Can you add the previous features back? Before the layout changed, this app was reassuring, satisfying, and easy to use. Having the ability to see all symptom options, and the ones chosen for the day floating inside the days box, all on the main page and visible at once. The nice details are now missing. And this thing is glitchy. It keeps messing up my cycles.",
            "Nothing like it was before the new update. Lots of features missing, including the custom log function. I have it set to send daily notifications and it does not work at all, it did before. It's a shame, really. The app, with what it does have, does what its supposed to do I suppose...except for the notifications.",
            "Since it did the update that renovated the whole app it's hard to use, every week it was giving me reminders that my IUD is up (It's not), it's slow, buggy, and irritating. I enjoyed it much more before they decided to basically turn it into a whole other app, it is nothing like it was before. You ruined your own app! This really sucks because I now feel stuck using it, because I've been using it for years and it's the only app I know of that'll track my cycle with my hormonal IUD",
            "I had stopped using this app for a bit, only to come back to it and it being completely unusable. I hit the log only to not be able to input anything! What's the point? It's almost as though this update was never tested before it was released. This is a 'revert until we fix this bug' type of situation and apologize to all your users. We can wait for an update....a reliable app tracking our periods to make sure we don't get pregnant, becoming unreliable can be life altering. Just a thought. 😡"

            "The brush itself and character are great, but the app is very glitchy. It doesn't record some days that they did brush with the app, and the parent dashboard is useless. I also think they could have done much better in developing the brush and program. The prizes are lame and repetitive, and education component is weak.( and wouldn't it be great if the app could review with your kids where they spent their brushing time after each brush? That technology exists and would be very helpful).",
            "Can't sync with other devices. My child is too young to brush his teeth alone and it's not always the same parent helping. Also when my phone died he had to start over so that was no fun. Additionally, he enjoys the app but the reward is almost always food. There is all kinds of food but the animation of the character eating is brief and always the same, so food is boring.",
            "A really great app that has engaged my daughter in her daily dental hygiene. After about 2 weeks it does become repetitious. I would suggest seasonal themed backgrounds and costumes. Trendy dance moves like the floss or even just a dab. Keeping the app up with current trends would get kids more motivate them to keep up their progress. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, great app. L-O-V-E it.",
            "App won't connect to the toothbrushes since the update. We had connectivity issues before, and usually got it to work for one of the toothbrushes before having to troubleshoot for the next toothbrush, but we could make it work well enough. Now the app won't even recognize the toothbrushes, even though I can show my phone lists it as an available device for Bluetooth. This app has been a major headache in our house.",
            "It often has trouble connecting to bluetooth with toothbrush. App mixes up characters between my 2 kids & they'll get upset thinking sister is using their program. My 1 girl gets all the awesome cat ears & stuff while the other gets only top hats & a plunger. Tonight my 1 girl got a 2nd present (gold) & the other did not. Needless to say that does not go over well with little kids... Downgrading to 1 star...keeps skipping the same one of my girls with the 2nd special present. Unnecessary tears."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

It let's you log a number of other things such as sleep, aches, etc. that allows for complex predictions. There is also a commjnity tab with a hood communtiy and many lady-related articles. Not as good as it used to be, but it still does what it's supposed to.",

            "I've been using this app since July and have always loved it. However since the last update, I have to manually enter/ search for everything each time as the feature for remembering previous foods/drinks no longer works. It's a bit inconvenient since a lot of my things have to be scanned. Also, the different options for measuring (gram, cup, tablespoon, etc) is missing on lots of items which makes it hard to be accurate when you only have 1 option.",
            "Its great! I like that it has an extensive food list, I can keep track of all my measurements and see trend breakdowns. Love the recipes too! App functions better than others that I have tried. Nothing glitch-y or slow loading screen. Easy to use! The information entered is correct! I have used other apps, where when you put in the food item, it will have completely wrong carb information. Drove me nuts! The price is better also, some other apps want you to pay $10.00 a month or like $60 yearly.",
            "I have tried many apps while looking for a tracker. This has been the best one! I love the search on the database, it's concise and easy to locate items. Recent searches show up first. One of my favorite features is that you are able to select the measurement of food instead of converting from grams or guessing how many pork rinds are in 14 grams. It is really easy to customize the macros to suit your personal goals. You can also add foods by scanning a bar code. Great app! Money well spent.",
            "I've tried different keto apps, but this one is by far the best. Not only can I easily keep track of my calories, fats and carbs but the app helps me keep track of my water intake and moods as well. This is my favorite app for my keto lifestyle. I've tried keto several times in my life and have been semi successful. The only thing missing was this app. I feel that with this app, I'll be able to monitor my food intake better, monitor my carbs better and ensure better success for myself.",
            "Just started using this app the first of August 2020. But so far it's great! Easy to use. Just enter the foods you eat and the app tracks the macros and keeps up with your daily intake. 10/17/20 Just did an update. Do NOT like it. Can't find foods I've used for 2 months. The app randomly changes the macros on the exact same item. Multiple issues with the update.Had to go down to 3 stars. I want to go back to the old one I had."

            "So disappointing that Jawbone devices/apps no longer work! I have both Jawbone & FitBit Trackers, but much preferred the interface of the UP app to that of the FitBit. Even though they are no longer in business (if you're wondering why you cannot connect your device) they should still allow users to access their Tracker via the UP app. and store data on their phones instead of their obsolete Servers. Sadly both are now redundant and my Tracker might as well go in the bin :(",
            "This app and company are now defunct. It's unfortunate, because this was my favorite app that gave legitimately interesting info based on walking goals. Still looking for a similar replacement.",
            "Dissapointed. Company closed their servers so the app and tracker won't work... don't waist your time to try to set it up as it will not connect.",
            "Servers are dead, rendering the bands useless unless you find a third party application that can communicate with the band. Take the app off of the store if you can't even use it. Release the source code so app developers can come out with applications that allow the use of the band. Useless.",
            "It never worked in the first place. My UP is fully charged, and I have very strong WIFI connection. I went on the app and selected my UP2, it took a good 5 minutes to load and then said I have no Internet connection. I'm super confused and sad, please tell me how to fix this problem. Edit : Looked at other reviews, and seems that the company have shut down. It's a real shame."

            "The app has its pros and cons. Pro: tells the best time of day for getting D from the sun and recommends length of exposure. This is its most valuable feature. Cons: If you close the app or move around in the app once your timer has started, it appears that the timer stops working. It would be useful for more detailed info on what to do (or not do) once a session has started. Would also like to be able to delete a session due to improper time recording. the app is decent - just needs some work.",
            "I like the app but it's a major battery hog. 30-40 min will kill 20% of battery. But the reports and blood level estimates are cool features. Would be nice if they had an easy way to add food sources via lookup.",
            "The app is fine, but not perfect by any means. Good luck working with or supporting the developer whose serious anger management issues and unprofessional attitude are reflected in reviews here and in how customer issues are dismissed, leading to an inferior product.",
            "Overall good. But the app badly under estimates d levels. I enter a blood test result. Get well above the rda for vitamin d throughout summer and the app 0redicts my d levels are plummeting Out by around 50%",
            "This app is incredible! Helps to track Vitamin D level wrt the time I spent in sunshine 🌞 Very useful 👍 Thank you for creating this app!"

            "I only have the free version, and I don't frequently find the need to sort by paid category, as I usually do my own research and use this as a tool to help with specific products, not as a primary search platform. It is really helpful, but I wish it had less general explanations for some ingredients. I understand it is based off the listing from the manufacturer, but some of the ingredients are under an umbrella listing rather than specifically listed. Ex. Fragrance vs Essential Oils",
            "Don't bother with this if you live outside of the USA. I live in the UK & tried to use it repeatedly. It didn't recognise any of the products I tried to scan/ stated they weren't in the database (this included products from The Body Shop. Not exactly a niche, unheard of brand). When I tried to manually enter each product (a complete ball ache) the app repeatedly crashed. Talks a lot about the FDA/ how the EU regs are better, so I suspect it would work in the US.",
            "Good tool... Things to note though: To get all the perks, you'll need to buy the add-on (i didn't and still love it); Lots of products out there haven't been rated (but you can submit them); Some ingredient ratings are confusing (ex. natural fragrance has like 100 diff. names); Look out for reviews of products before buying (just because it's a '0' on the scale doesn't mean it's the best option out there😅).",

            "Absolutely garbage app; cannot pair with my new toothbrush. I've tried literally everything. I've contacted their support team multiple times and did every step they requested (even the one where they told me to reset my connection settings with no explanation on what that entailed... which cleared out all stored WiFi/bluetooth data in my phone and still did not help.) They even sent me a replacement handle and guess what? That doesn't pair with the app either! So yeah, don't waste your time.",
            "This app is mostly mediocre when it works. It is pretty dumb about recognizing the brush movement to the point where if you are leaning down it doesn't think you're brushing anything. On top of that it only checks for brushing front and back of teeth, not top. Also currently I can't even use it because it gets stuck trying to load the login popup forever. Feels very underbaked.",
            "Generally a good experience but the last 7 days doesn't load most of the time and it's the reason for the rating. Also wish the brush had a memory to upload later. Taking phone into bathroom everytime (twice day) to record brush session isn't realistic and gets annoying. For the money this should be an included feature on future models.",
            "10/24/2020 update: The latest update claims \"A redesigned experience makes setting up your toothbrush and app easier. Plus, technical updates improve the brush to app connection\" but the app only randomly connects with the toothbrush. I love the toothbrush but the app is now useless which is the #1 reason I bought the toothbrush. The app worked fine until the latest Android update on 10/01/2020 and now it will not connect to the toothbrush. This is the only Bluetooth connected device app I'm having trouble with after the Android update.",
            "App doesn't get through setup. I have a OnePlus 6, and a new SonicCare Diamond brush. Unboxed it and fully charged it. Then downloaded the app. Lit up the toothbrush by pressing the mode button, opened the app and it detected the toothbrush ok. But once I got to the \"Let's get started\" page it just spins like a record. Tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app. Can never get past that screen."

It allows you to put mods and symptoms on days you want, can help with trying to conceive let's you know when your ovulating and can help you track your basal body temp.",
            "I've been using this app for years and it's amazing! It's very accurate and allows me to track my PMS so that I know how to manage it better and can prepare for my mood variations. I've also used it to plan so I can avoid my period on beach holidays or can figure out what I'll wear to an event, keeping my bloat/bleed in mind.",
            "I have used this app for many years, however recently I am finding it boring. No updates for a while, no new themed pages or new moods/ faces to add. I do not want to find an alternative app to track my cycle and mood, however I feel this app could do with a bit of a make over for 2021.",
            "I love this app! I had the free version before but had to get the deluxe. There is so much I can do with this app! It is really easy to use. It really helps me remember my periods. It's especially helpful for when I go to the doctor and they ask me when my last period was so I just check the app and I can easily tell them. The layout and design is nice.",
            "I didn't realize just how much I used this app until after having a kid and my body went back to normal. The first couple periods I was unprepared for, mostly in the hormonal swings and moods. I used to plan my calendar based on this app -when I would be charismatic, when I would want to stay home and away from people, when to give myself a little extra patience. I am glad to get back into this practice."

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

        "description": "COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...",
            "Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an 'Internal Error, please try again' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",
            "I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own? I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.",
            "While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I'm home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me.",
            "Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC.

I truly believe our NC health department is trying to help us remain healthy and I truly appreciate the effort. So far, I've not been in contact with anyone positive and Im thankful!",
            "Little to no impact on my phone performance and battery life. Appears to work as described, but many more people in North Carolina need to install this app. This app can help to slow the spread of Covid-19 by alerting you to early possible exposure to someone who tested positive. This app needs to be promoted more prominently on social media so people will know it's available. I found it by chance on the Google Play app.",
            "I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

Uninstalled, reinstalled, every time I try to open, an error pops up \"how we feel keeps stopping\" I had started getting warning that it was causing high battery consumption so maybe for the best. Entered it faithfully for 6+ months but can't enter data when it won't open. We had a good run. galaxy S8",
            "The \"update\" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message. I've sent feedback @ least 3x, with no reply back. I've uninstalled & reinstalled, & I've shut my phone off & on, nothing helps! Something similar happened in Sept too, although when I reinstalled the App after over 100 check in's it started back over at 1 as if I was new to the site. Hopefully you'll get this taken care of ASAP or like everyone else, I'm going to have 2 uninstall.",
            "Well, it's about 7 months, and over 180 posts after my first review. The app won't open for me, it just bounces right back to the home screen. I'm sad about this, but it's been happening for a couple of weeks now. The developers should update, or fix whatever is going wrong.",
            "App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.",
            "Since the latest update, this app does not start at all,l in my Galaxy S20 Ultra... crashes immediately. Dev should ( in my opin) roll back update until a stable Android update is available if they want to keep collecting free data."

            "It's great the annoying thing is that you need a premium access to your spotify to listen to music (I cant afford premium access) if you could change this that'll be lovely!!!",
            "My daughter has been using this app for a while when she out grew the more kiddy ones. We download some songs from our librarie's fregal subscription. However they cancelled the subscription and we got bored with our selections, so I finally upgraded my Spotify subscription. However I can only seem to open one playlist to use? I don't get a choice. Am I doing something wrong? Is this normal? We also can't pick a specific song? I'm not as concerned about that though.",
            "I loved the app the couple times I've used it. The way the timer works is wonderful and so is being able to play my own music. However the big reason I downloaded this app is because I struggle to remember to brush my teeth and I wanted the notification to remind me. I turned the notification on and made sure I could get notifications from the app in my phone settings as well but I do not get the notifications unless I remember to open the app at the times I set it for.",
            "Great app for teenagers! My 13 and 15 yo will actually use it bc it's not an app for little kids, so it's wonderful!! They like the music options too. Suggestion for future: I'd really like it if I could see the days I brush on a calendar. Then even get my whole family involved, and have a healthy competition going with the kids on who brushed more that week! But I know you're actively working on it and so far so good. Keep it up!",
            "Great! I've never been more consistent about brushing my teeth. The only suggestion is notifications should have varying levels of annoyance if you need more motivation! Like one that is more of an alarm than a reminder. It would also be nice to access another music app like pandora or YouTube music if you don't have Spotify premium. But otherwise, great app and great concept. I love the ragtime song :) Thank you!!"

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

Unfortunately, on my Samsung A50 the text on the larger widget does not display properly (it is too high for its container so you cannot read it). Also both widgets are way too short - they use very little of the screen height that they take up / occupy.",

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "One month after android 11 update and the keyboard bug still exists. Keyboard does not come up trying to search. Recommendation after I gave feedback was to downgrade to android 10, really?!? Not really a solution in my books and a month is too long without an update required for compatibility. I just feel stuck as this has a lot of my journey stored here but would not recommend at this point in time.",
            "I really like the simplistic idea behind this app, but fact like basic foods like raisins and quark are missing, and there's no food search function (you have swipe to find the right item), makes it difficult to commit to it. Even though I like the food icons and thr cute visuals, UI is way too cluttered. Finally, measurements are not always consistent in each food (eg. No gram unit available in all foods). I'd be happy to try this app on it's next iterations to see if they fixed these points.",
            "I had given this 5 stars. I even paid for the premium version in 2017. But then there was an update, and the premium version stopped. The ads have returned and the app lost some functionality. I'm not going to keep paying for new premium versions after every update.",
            "Great free version that is a good guide to tracking your macros. Not an exact measurement but close enough to be very useful.",
            "Great app! Takes a bit to figure out how to navigate thru it, but that's the way it is with all apps. I'm not doing keto, but still tracking my macros. I have lost 5 lbs (maybe some water weight, but i have increased my H2O intake) in a week because I am aware of what I am eating, thanks to this app. Well worth the $25."

Above nutrition facts and labels, you get NOVA food classification (i.e. 4 processing levels defined by UN), vegan compliance and palm oil flags. You can build your product lists.

After my third pregnancy (2020) I got a notification saying the app added pregnancy stuff, but I haven't checked it out because it was after my pregnancy. I'm here now to suggest they add \"clumsy\" to their symptoms area of the period tracker. Clumsiness is largely a hormonal symptom for me.",

            "Absolutely love this app. Can customize workouts so it's great for everyone from beginner to advanced. You don't need a gym membership to stay in shape. All you need is this app and a chair. You will be amazed at how many awesome cardio and strength exercises you can do at home for free and without risking getting COVID at a gym. It's been a lifesaver for me.",
            "Personally I like the smart workout which I'm using to help recuperate after injury. I'd like the ability to browse through exercises after the session to rate them as the opportunity is lost if not paused. Also support for Google music is dated given the migration to YouTube. App urgently needs an update to reflect changes. Lost a star for that. An update could easily gain these back.",
            "It's a great app. I don't have to think about what I'm going to do for cardio. The workouts are balanced - a good mix of upper, lower, and core bodyweight exercises. It has a feature where it makes a workout for you (Smart workout), or you can follow the pre-planned workouts. This app is free, but I feel like it offers mostly the same content as many paid HIIT apps.",
            "Easy to follow exercises. Optional warm up and cool down. You can rate as you go along and your programme is modified accordingly. In our busy lives we sometimes tell ourselves that we don't have time to exercise. But 7 minutes?? We all have that. Perfect for me.",
            "I like the flexibility of time, location and workout objective with which I can use this app. It is also a customisable tool with diversity between strength and aerobic tasks. The blocks of time are also easy to fit within whatever I have available that day. I would (and already have to friends) highly recommend this app. Update 30 Sept 2020: Hello. Because of the workout library and the fact that the science behind the workouts is also available for reference, Iam upgrading to 5 stars. Kudos."

            "Could be a great little thing, especially for TCOYF users, but I've really lost my patience with it - I've never before encountered such a technically unstable, buggy app. Apart from the fact that it feels quite dated, it also constantly runs into problems - i.e. unable to connect to the server, no matter what you do. This means no access to previous cycles, no possibility to enter new data. Essentially, one year of tracking is gone out of the window. Very, very disappointing.",
            "This was the best app out of 4 that I have tried. I say WAS because all of a sudden it's stopped working & telling me \"login failed\". I've religiously used the app for almost a year. I've uninstalled & reinstalled the app several times today & no change. There isn't even an option to logout so I can try to login again. Your app holds tons of very important information for those of us having difficulty w/ getting pregnant & it's nerve wracking for it to not work. Will change to 5 stars when fixed",
            "The most frustrating app I've used for tracking cycles. The accompanying device does not sync thru Bluetooth sensors even though it has an option. You can't go back and edit dates and data throughout the cycle.The app doesn't let you view previous cycles to edit just the completed chart. I ended a cycle thinking that my period was starting and I can't go back to fix it. Honestly I wish it would be updated to 2020 standards. If I I have to send an email to understand the app, its not clear enough",
            "Started using this month every day on my Android phone, but tht last 2 days it just keeps saying log in failed. I've rebooted my phone, checked for updates, and it still isn't working. All my data for this month are not accessible now 😭",
            "My first fam track app was OVY( simultaneously using it to the ovagraph). I like that the app is very detailed and you can add a lot of different points. It's also very customised. Unfortunately the user interface is very glitchy. I get logged out even if I'm online. Everytime I want to read a thread and go back afterwards I end up on the home screen instead of the community. Also it seems to be all about TTC and there is nothing about birth control. 🤔 Maybe the online version is better."

            "Its fun and awesome and theres even a real cookbook with all these recipes in it but its sad it charges the little kids to beable to make more than 1 type cake. When most other apps are free. Theres no add in this but still. Its my daughter's fav app so I paid for more.",
            "I gave you only one star because I liked it very little. The problem is that I am a kid and and I can't buy stuff. Your other games are like that too. It is showing that I need to make a blue Very Berry Shortcake but blue is locked. Fix it 😡😡😡😡",
            "Honestly i realy like this game , but i have to buy so PLEASE MAKE IT FAIR . I just dont want to wast my money ok..",
            "Honestly, its pretty fun. But, we barley get options for anything. I really do think that maybe 1 or 2 more cake options should be free, along with more decorations, food dye, and utensils.",
            "Only one cake is unlocked. All the others are locked and you have to pay for each one. One is currently £2.99 and another one is £9.99. Seems like a really lovely app and i wouldn't mind paying if it was for all for £9.99."

However, the modification date changes when renaming the file, which shouldn't happen.

            "There are so many add. in this app which can irritate anyone. Also you can not see your hidden files in free version which most of the file manager apps provide.",
            "I've been using this app for years now, it's absolutely brilliant I love it and I would recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a better system for their files than the one pre installed on their phone. All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

Needs fixing as it does not reflect the actual calories burnt in a day. 2. I would like to pick my own exercises in the workout generator",
            "It doesnt give tips on how to do it it just gives you an animation, But it was good and made me sweat a bit, totally recomend it for workout and self defense, or fighting.",
            "Overall this is a great app. However, whenever the app is counting down the seconds, it always pauses my audio that is either on YouTube and other sources, which is a little inconvenient as I like listening to podcasts while training. To the Developers, Are you able to fix this problem? Thank you in advance.",
            "Proper schedule of moves to be done in a day as per beginner, intermediate and advance level which makes it easier to do the stances and not learn everything in a day. Though as I have been trained in martial art previously I felt during kicks the blocks are not there which is disadvantage for a new learner as it will stay with him and he will face problem during fights.",
            "Great app easy to learn. I go to a school that's always got fights going on (my friend got his nose broke before lockdown as an example.) This app has definitely made me feel more confident. I'm not the best when It comes to physicality but this app has helped my feel I can defend myself without weeks of weightlifting and push ups."

Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",

Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",

Sensor data hasn't been downloaded and when I tried to contact customer services the email they provide doesn't work. They say they will contact you but I haven't heard from them and it's been days!",
            "the new app is being very buggy... not downloading sensor data for the last two days, saying it is insufficient, messing with my cycles, saying my last cycle is this cycle... fhe old app worked flawlessly.",
            "Gets ovulation wrong most months. Support will tell you it's not wrong, even when it is. Horribly overpriced.",
            "Beware! They dont comply with law when asking for a refund at 14 days to return for online consumer goods. I paid an expensive £150 which has gone down the drain. I read their policy which has a £50 retention so illegal and dodgy under 14 day period. They ignore your emails and if you call them its a voicemail which they never call back. I emailed many times. The gadget is faulty as it download sometimes which is extremely upsetting. I was hoping it would help with my pcos ovulation tracking."

There are also many pictures of realistic paintings of ladies under the topic \"FASHION\"... But the reason why I rated this app four stars is that you need to pay money for a few pictures.. You need to pay money for all the zodiac signs and for most of the realistic painings of ladies... That is one my my complaints. Another one is that there are many ads😕",

            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",

Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away.

        "description": "Overcoming addiction is extremely hard. With Quitzilla - Habit Breaker you can follow all of your bad habits and addictions and use the app as help to analyze them and beat them. Besides the counting of days, it also features a sobriety clock letting you know the exact hour when you break the habit. Use it for overcoming drugs, gambling, junk food, and sugar addictions.\r\n\r\nBAD HABITS TRACKER.\r\nCommit to quit \"cold turkey\"! Enter your bad habit or addiction at a glance. You can add the exact day of the last time you did it, the money you spend usually on that bad habit or addiction and let it serve as your starting point. From then on you can get tons of interesting statistics about it. The abstinence time and money saved are the leading statistics. \r\n\r\nREWARDS.\r\nThe rewards feature is actually a calculation of the money saved. For example, if you’ve spent $100 on gambling weekly, and you haven’t gambled for a week, then those $100 are your weekly reward. Users can also manually add rewards for themselves.

        "descriptionHTML": "Overcoming addiction is extremely hard. With Quitzilla - Habit Breaker you can follow all of your bad habits and addictions and use the app as help to analyze them and beat them. Besides the counting of days, it also features a sobriety clock letting you know the exact hour when you break the habit. Use it for overcoming drugs, gambling, junk food, and sugar addictions.<br><br><b>BAD HABITS TRACKER.</b><br>Commit to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot;! Enter your bad habit or addiction at a glance. You can add the exact day of the last time you did it, the money you spend usually on that bad habit or addiction and let it serve as your starting point. From then on you can get tons of interesting statistics about it. The abstinence time and money saved are the leading statistics. <br><br><b>REWARDS.</b><br>The rewards feature is actually a calculation of the money saved. For example, if you’ve spent $100 on gambling weekly, and you haven’t gambled for a week, then those $100 are your weekly reward. Users can also manually add rewards for themselves. This serves as great motivation to quit alcohol, cigarettes, junk food or anything similar that costs us money and is bad for our body and health.<br><br><b>MOTIVATION.</b><br>Sobriety Counter also features a motivation tab in which you can add your own reasons to quit your addiction and bad habits.

            "I like the simplicity of the app; and though some customization and home screen widgets are locked behind the pro version, I think this is a great app with a very simplistic UI. As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",
            "This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",
            "I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",
            "Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool",
            "Really helps. In the past I've tried to quit smoking and bought a little $1 cigar to 'tide me over'... I always ended up returning to smoking. But I didn't this time because I didn't want to reset my progress. It really helps to see it. One week, no smokes for me!"

I am actually really interested in drugs (Of course I won't take any) and how it affects you mentally. Even though I am only 13 years old, I learn alot already, how a type of drug can have an effect on me. Since now it might slowly be the stage where people always take drugs, I will always have a cautious eye!",
            "I honestly think this is a great app. I have no use for it myself atm. But life is life and people will be people. This info is often hard to scrap together. Can't vouch for accuracy bc it's too far away but if credible it could be a great resource for many many people and could help lessen stigmas by even existing. I am no advocate for or against the subject of this app. But it has the potential to save many many lives. Just hope that aspect was part of the motivation for creating this. Props.",
            "The app is great for learning about all types of drugs. I like how it also lists its soures, but the app can be improved on. For example, almost every single drug I see is MDMA. Mix it up! Not every drug is MDMA. Also, it would be cool if you could go to the Substances tab and click on a substance that has a drop down on all drugs affiliated. Like if I click on Nicotine, there would be a dropdown list of all drugs containing nicotine.",
            "This is an amazing app! Very user-friendly, with a lot of important resources. I especially love the database of chemicals. Much-recommended for anyone who uses psychoactive drugs.",
            "This app is AWESOME but something I would like is to explain the difference between ways of consuming, I know there is the graph but I think that difference could be more explained and that'd be cool and really useful"

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "Used this for my son going into the Marines. Had to loose 20# in 20 days. It worked! Also use it for my other son with wrestling. In addition to the diet we always have a nutritional protein with greens smoothie/shake in the morning and before bed. One teaspoon each maca powder, wheat grass powder, spirulina powder, and one tablespoon raw organic cocao powder in almond milk.",
            "Military diet is only for over weight people. How much you lose depends greatly on your bmr (height, weight, age, and gender). For instance, if you were a 27 year old, height: 5'11\", weight: 200, and gender: male. Then your normal calorie intake to maintain your weight will be 1900 calories a day. 1900-1400= 500 calories, so you will lose 500 calories a day of real fat with no exercise. If your weight drops more than 1 pound in a week then that extra is what you call water weight.",
            "I thought I was getting a military diet but I was sorely mistaken! No where in this diet did I eat 9000 calories worth of MRE's nor did I shovel a piled high plate of food in my mouth in under 10min and not defecate for a week! Nothing about chain smoking, dipping, or drinking coffee and monsters until my heart explodes. Worst part is no dirt bag terrorist tried poisoning my food or attempted to drop bombs on my head as I ate.",
            "During my 3 days this app has pretty much become my bible. Not only is the layout easy to follow but it also includes helpful tips and explanations behind why some lost more than others so you're not making the same critical mistakes. I have lost 8lbs during my 3 days and an additional 2lbs up to my day 6. For those of you who are trying this, this is a week long diet. The 3 days set you up for a successful week and depending on your choices for days 4-7 you can get maximum results!"

There's only ads in the menu which you can skip straight away and they don't interfere while you're working out like other similar apps. Only pay wall is for advanced training sessions which I personally will pay for once I've finished intermediate. Great job. If I had more storage on my phone I'd try other apps from the same developers."

The biggest negative are the adds: They don't just occupy a bar at the lower edge of the monitor; sometimes take total command of the app.",

Very frustrating app",
            "Useful for tracking weight and keeping notes without a lot of extra calorie counting stuff. HOWEVER. To be truly perfect, app needs to offer a way to track weight in longer than 30-day increments AND to be able to set the date range for the \"Lost Weight\" box. Most people don't care about seeing the 30-day or less change, weight loss is a much longer range activity! Right now I have to put the total loss since beginning of my tracking in the notes. And finally, it was ridiculous not to be able to type in my date of birth, instead having to scroll back over 20 years of monthly calendars!"

            "Love this. Brilliant app for tracking workouts at the gym. Developer, is there any chance that you could add a feature where the timer function goes to a negative timer if you run over your rest time period, so you know how long over your rest period you've gone? So if I select a rest time of 30 seconds. But I rest for 45 seconds. The timer would read -15 seconds. Hope that makes sense! Thanks for reading. Matt.",
            "A great fitness app. Love seeing the graphs of lifts and the breakdown of parts of the body hit by the exercises. The use of this app alone has allowed me to push my self harder and get better lifts. It is great to see the past data and get over the psychological barrier of a lift when you know you have the data to back up the jump in weight. Overall phenomenal app and I'm super happy with it",
            "Best app for tracking gym and cardio hands down! Really straightforward and simple to use, dont even need instructions. Best of all gives more stats about you than you even need! Love this app! Please dont stop developing. For improvements maybe make widgets, possibly showing improvements for each body part? Also maybe smart watch support",
            "Really like this app. Edited on 9/23/2020 I've been using this app for over a year now and find its the best workout log app I could find. I tested quite a few others but they all have their flaws. I really like how you can easily access your history for each exercise so you know what weight to use and how many reps you need to do for a PR. I also like how they allow you to create full routines, unlike other apps which just allow you to create a individual days or workouts.",
            "Great app! I've been using it since 2016 and the features are extensive yet so easy to use. Being able to chart really helps with seeing progress and motivation. It's fun to say that lifted 1 million pounds last year, or that I did +600kms of cardio... all with pretty charts! I just had to register as a supporter.

I got this app by recommendation by someone who uses it as a keyboard, and when I downloaded it no such option occurred for me. That does limit my ability to use the app. Very frustrating. That being said, this app does provide access to a better selection of gifs and more ways to use them. Cool app.",
            "As soon as app is opened I get \"Internet service is lost\" every time despite my service is fine; can't seem to create or access an account. After seeing that these are known issues for at least 5 months, I lowered the rating. Clearly the developer has stopped supporting it.",
            "Every time i open this app it says there is no internet connection....but at the same time my youtube and messenger is running very fine....without connection issues....please fix this....iam sorry i had to give you 3 stars otherwise i would've given you guys 5 on 5.",
            "It worked well initial few days, but now I can't upload my own created gifs on Tenor, if I try to upload 5-6 gifs, after loading ,it only upload 1-2 gifs, sometimes even not a single gif is being uploaded. Please fix this issue.",

            "Great app! Wish it had a flexibility/ stretching option for \"type.\" I have been using the strength as the type, but it still would be nice to not have 30 second stretch interfere with the data for reps. Same complaint for exercises that are for time. But it's really not THAT big of a deal. Overall, great app!",
            "I like how this app gives me the flexibility to define my parameters, lists etc. Although some prefer a predefined setup like \"fancy apps\", I love the flexible basic relational DB element approach. The only thing I dont prefer is the AutoCap of the first letter when creating a new exercise etc. I automatically do this on my own text keyboard and the tool reverses my natural habit.",
            "Easy to use! The only thing I wish it would do is connect with my Fitbit. There isn't one exercise I haven't found not already downloaded. To me more advanced if it had pictures or description of the machines to know which exercise your logging (i.e. abductor vs adductor). Other than I really do love the app!",
            "This has the straightforward functionality that I want for creating and tracking workouts. I wanted to replace my manual spreadsheet, and this lets me set up a series of exercises/routines and easily switch back and forth between history and current exercise/workout. For each exercise, number of reps is the minimum info needed, with options to easily track weight used (if relevant), elapsed time, and notes. Does what it says - well named!",
            "Very nice to use, once you get past the learning curve. The developer is very responsive. Very customizable. For example, for exercises I do at the gym on their machines, l prefixed the exercise name with initials of the gym to keep them all together. I set up a routine for each day. Exercises can be moved around within a routine. Your data can be exported by the app as a .CSV file (which can be read by any spreadsheet program) to your email."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",

I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
