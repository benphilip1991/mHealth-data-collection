        "description": "Constipation is a disorder of the digestive tract. When you suffer from constipation your bowels don't regularly move or they are not emptied completely. Unfortunately constipation can cause many diseases because this disorder produces many toxins and these can reach in the blood stream and in this way they are carried in all your body.\r\n\r\nPeople of all ages can suffer from constipation taking into account that it is one of the most common digestive disorders. Most of the time this disorder is just temporary and it can be treated very easy. A great attention must be paid to the chronic constipation. It must be not neglected because it can lead to hemorrhoids, fecal impaction, piles, fecal incontinence, and anal fissures.\r\n\r\nFortunately this digestive disorder can be treated very easy. More on, there are lots of natural treatments that can help you to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n\r\nConstipation has many symptoms: from difficulty, infrequency or irregularity in elimination of hard fecal matter, foul breath, loss of appetite, coated tongue, dizziness, headache, dark circles under the eyes to dark circles under the eyes, depression, ulcer in mouth, varicose veins, acidity, insomnia, pain in the lumbar region, constant fullness in the abdomen and varicose veins.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nThe main causes of constipation are a fault style of life and a fault diet. Stress can be a cause, too.\r\n\r\nNatural Treatments\r\n\r\nMost of the fruits except jack fruit and banana are very useful in constipation treatments. Of course some are more effective than others. For example Bael fruit is considered the best natural laxative. But there are many other fruits that can help you to treat this digestive disorder as well.\r\n\r\nPears are very beneficial to treat constipation. If you eat a pear during your breakfast or after dinner, its effects will be surprising.\r\n\r\nGuava is another natural remedy. If you eat it with seeds, it provides your diet roughage. Eat one or two guavas every day and you will not suffer from constipation anymore.\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that they are very tasty, grapes are a merciless enemy of constipation.\r\n\r\nGrapes contain sugar, organic acid and cellulose and this combination make them to be a great natural laxative. Besides the fact that they clear the bowels they also tone up intestines and the stomach. Eat at least 350 gm of grapes daily.\r\n\r\nOranges can help you, too. Eat one or two oranges at dinner and at breakfast and the problem is resoled. Figs and papaya are very useful, too. You can also treat your constipation with spinach. Squeeze half of a lime in a glass of hot water and mix it with 5 gm of salt. You can also swallow a teaspoon of linseed with a glass of water before your meals. Drinking a glass of water in which you put a teaspoon of honey is another way to get rid of constipation. Drink teas made from herbal known as good laxatives. Drink horse gowan tea for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will help you not to suffer from constipation.",

I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart.

However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT.

            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. üôÇ",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

Normally infants have 4-5 bowel movements daily. Breast-fed babies will have more bowel movements than formula-fed babies, and they rarely develop constipation. Constipation occurs when there is a violation of normal bowel function. Normal bowel function in babies can vary on several grounds. As age increases and complementary food is introduced, babies tend to develop lesser bowel movements. Bowel movements occurring two times a day in a 6 months old baby is very normal, and any rate less than that is to be identified as constipation.\r\n\r\nThis app also will explain about:\r\n\r\nchild constipation\t\r\nbanana constipation\t\r\nbaby constipation massage\t\r\nbaby foods that help with constipation\t\r\n\r\nFeatures of the app:\r\n\r\nCan Use For Offline App\r\nUpdated regularly\r\nYou can ask questions from our experts\r\nSimple app book Knowledge like pocket on your phone\r\nYou can also send us your suggestions and we will add them inside the app For more updates.\r\n\r\nExplaining for Baby Constipation:\r\n\r\nWhen baby has painful defecation and when the consistency of the feces is hard the condition can be considered as baby constipation. One of the very noticeable signs of baby constipation is a crying baby characterized by abdominal pain. In a baby with constipation, defecation may occur daily but the feces will be thick and in small fragments. It can be caused by a dysfunctional large intestine or an abnormal colon. Mostly it is caused by pinching of feces in the lower intestine due to constriction of muscles. The more the stool remains in the intestine the harder it becomes. However, baby constipations are of two types- organic constipation and functional constipation.\r\n\r\nIn organic constipation anatomical defects or developmental disabilities play a significant role. Usually organic constipation begins at birth due to the lack of independent defecation. Other causes for organic constipation are an enlarged colon with a narrowing lower region as in Hirschsprung's disease and Dolichosigmoid.\r\n\r\nFunctional constipation may be due to a variety of reasons such as an improper diet of feeding mother, baby's reduced intake of water, artificial feeding in infancy, irregular diet of children, dehydration and mainly, oppression of the defecation reflex.\r\n\r\nDownload Baby Constipation App now for get more value from this free app.",

            "This is a really great idea, it has loads of tracking options that I just love. But it has some bugs that mean I can't retrospectively add things, for example if I go to bed exhausted and haven't remembered to track my dinner that evening, I can't add it the next day. It also doesn't allow me to add ingredients that are not included on its surprisingly restricted list of ingredients. Overall, wonderful idea but the execution needs work.",
            "The app does a decent job of tracking bowel movements, diet, and medicine. I have noted several issues and sent reports to the app developers. I have received no response. The preset medicine doses will sometimes double or quadruple in your queue and past medical history. I have on prescription that shows up eight times a day when I only take it once a day. Also if you add a duplicate food item you cannot delete it. And the ingredient options and search feature is extremely limited.",
            "Although this is a good app and it is headed in the right direction I find it not as easy or simple to use as other meal or health logging apps. I have my medications listed in the app but I'd like to be able to log if I have had them or not, it's handy to look back and see when I forgot my medication and how it affected me. I find the coloured backgrounds also make it harder to read. And I'd like to see more auto immune flammatory symptoms listed that are connected. E.g., sore back, dermatitis.",
            "Absolutely amazing, thank you so incredibly much for developing (& continuing to improve) this app...it has been a real game changer for me. I've tried many versions of food logs and wellness apps over the years but nothing compares to the insight I have gained through the easy and intuitive design of this application. Tracking my health doesn't feel like a chore anymore!!",
            "I use it to track my bowel movements everyday. It's very helpful for when I have doctors appointments or test/procedures done because when they ask how many times a day I go or about my bleeding and what not all the information is there on my phone and completely accurate because it's recorded. It's also nice because I can remember when I've had scopes or blood tests too because it also tracks that."

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

            "Not worth the $1.99. If you put in an entry the minute you're going to the bathroom, the time will be exact but will only do increments of 15min otherwise. The scroll UI to change time is horribly sensitive. Poops and notes are separate entries, not together. Text box in note entries doesn't support autocorrect, navigating anywhere in the text, or copy&paste; SUPER annoying for spelling errors. Blood tracking appears in entries even when turned off.

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",
            "I use it for my IBS and how bloated I am etc good reminder."

Este patr√≥n a menudo ocurre en el s√≠ndrome del intestino irritable (SII). Al final del espectro, hablamos de impactaci√≥n fecal, que es cuando las heces se endurecen en el recto e impiden el paso (aunque a veces la diarrea puede ocurrir incluso con obstrucci√≥n debido a una fuga de l√≠quido c√≥lico alrededor de las heces afectadas).\r\n\r\nEl n√∫mero de evacuaciones intestinales generalmente disminuye con la edad. La mayor√≠a de los adultos tienen lo que se considera normal, entre tres y 21 veces por semana. El patr√≥n m√°s com√∫n es un movimiento de arco por d√≠a, pero este patr√≥n se observa en menos de la mitad de los individuos.

El estre√±imiento severo se define como menos de una comisi√≥n por semana. No hay raz√≥n m√©dica para tener una silla de montar todos los d√≠as. No tener uno durante dos o tres d√≠as no causa malestar f√≠sico, s√≥lo angustia mental (en algunas personas). Contrariamente a la creencia popular, no hay evidencia de que las ‚Äútoxinas‚Äù se acumulen cuando el movimiento es infrecuente o el estre√±imiento conduce al c√°ncer.

        "description": "FODMAP Helper - Diet Companion\r\nThis app makes identification of high and low FODMAP foods easier to help you with your FODMAP friendly diet. This can be helpful in reducing symptoms for people with IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance and various other food intolerances, food sensitivities, and stomach problems.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Comprehensive list of foods and whether or not they are low FODMAP foods, to make finding foods that won't exacerbate your IBS easier.\r\n- Search by food name and category.\r\n- General FODMAP Diet and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and - \r\n- Lactose Intolerence and other food sensitivities info.\r\n- Additional details on the specific breakdowns of each food and whether it is high, medium, or low in the main categories of Polyols, Oligos, Fructose, and Lactose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Features Include:\r\nMy Experience - Log your personal experience with foods to determine if a food works for you regardless of its FODMAP content. Rate whether you had a good or bad reaction to a food after eating it, then leave detailed notes so that you know for next time how said food will affect you.\r\n\r\nCommunity Experience - See how the community has reacted to a food via anonymized My Experience ratings. This will let you know if the majority of users of the app had a good or bad reaction to a food.\r\n\r\nMy Experience and Community Experience data analysis - Advanced graphs and data analysis present the my experience and community experience data to you in a useful and intuitive format to show you breakdowns of good and bad reactions to the various food categories as well as what your worst foods are.\r\n\r\nChallenge - The FODMAP Diet is an elimination diet for IBS, GI diseases, and food sensitivities. Once you've eliminated all high FODMAP foods from your diet, you can challenge foods to determine if they work for you.

We can have things remain out of public eye, not cuz it's shameful or secretive it's just decent to not put in veiw. There's a lot of gross things we will ultimately see in our Iives, we don't have to add things that aren't nessesary to the list.",

This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

        "description": "In Curing Irritable Bowel Syndrome I concisely and thoroughly discuss everything there is to know about the causes, symptoms and diagnosis of of IBS including -\r\n1. What role stress plays in causing IBS\r\n2. What it means to have a \"sensitive colon\"\r\n3. How doctors determine how severe the condition is in any individual sufferer\r\n4. Why the condition of Irritable Bowel Syndrome is so difficult to diagnose in the first place!\r\n5. A description of the other medical conditions and afflictions that IBS shares symptoms with and is commonly confused with!\r\n6. A discussion of both the Manning Criteria and the Rome III Criteria which are used by doctors to officially diagnosis a case of IBS\r\n7. Why both loose bowels and constipation are both symptoms of the condition\r\n8. What types of bowel movements to look for in your toilet bowel that may indicate that you have IBS\r\n9. The physical symptoms that many people suffer when they have IBS\r\n10. What anxiety or depression may have to do with IBS\r\n11. How allopathic doctors test for a positive diagnosis of IBS\r\n12. How the use of laxatives can make it difficult to diagnose the condition\r\n\r\nAnd many more issues to do with the diagnosis Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\r\n\r\nARE YOU FRUSTRATED WITH DRUGS THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE A DOING A THING FOR YOUR IBS?\r\n\r\nYOU ARE NOT ALONE!\r\n\r\nIn Curing Irritable Bowel Syndrome I also go through all of the medicines that you might be prescribed by Western Doctors and give you an idea of what to expect including ...\r\n1. A discussion of diphonenoxylate and atropine and how these two drugs interfere with the passage of waste through your system to control diarrhea\r\n2.Why many experts consider diphenoxylate to be a narcotic that gets you high and why it is also considered to be as dangerous and addictive as any street drug\r\n3. The dangerous drug interactions that can occur if you are taking Nardil or Mantulane\r\n4. Why taking Imodium can have a negative impact on the muscle lining of your intestines and make the symptoms of the disorder even worse\r\n5. How some drugs that are commonly prescribed for IBM can stain and damage your teeth and cause problems with the throat and swallowing\r\n6. How the overuse of stool softeners can lead to serious problems such as laxative dependence, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance\r\n7.

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book üò≠ I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure. Most types of porphyria are inherited from a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.",

For beginners there're way too many technical terms just to fill in the page. For professionals we know there'rre A LOT of danger with what they're mentioning regarding the method on how to use the plant. Cut the leaf and ingest it? What part of the leaf? How many? Unless you know what you're doing, don't risk it",

This app should be in every phone because doctors won't tell you \" fix yourself \" , with common products found in many homes , to solve your problem . After all they are in the pill prescription business",

Some of the recommendations are more like old folk cures and again, omit proven useful herbal remedies. I would not rely on this app for anything.",

And it was like every day there was something new to find out. Love it!!",

            "This is an amazing app. It literally tells u all kinds of home made natural remedies and recipes u can use or make to use. For me, I've been having trouble with acne and it gave me a huge list with good detailing on what I need, and how to use it, and how to make it. It's not just for acne though. Upset stomach, in general just wanting to b healthy. It's a great app. At least for me it is. It's worth it to check out if ur into stuff like this",
            "The site is amazing from A to Z and then some. It goes far beyond my expectations, especially considering it's free! It's a plethora of information ! Not to mention the advertisements are minimal and not intrusive ! 100% recommend this app"

        "description": "This log can help you track the everyday things that have an impact on your pain. When you understand what makes your pain worse, you can begin to work on ways to reduce or deal with your pain ‚Äútriggers.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThe more you know about how your body reacts, the more you can be in control. And being in better control can help you be less afraid and better able to manage your pain. \r\n\r\nThis app makes it easy to track your pain & symptoms and report to your doctors. Use our pain diary to keep track of your pain over time and share it with your doctor at your next appointment. Track a variety of pain elements, including location, pain duration, triggers and more.\r\n\r\nA pain diary is used to monitor levels of pain over a long period of time and collect data on possible triggers for that pain. One solution pain doctors recommend is keeping a pain diary, a consistent record of your pain experience.\r\n\r\nYour doctor will be looking for triggers, stresses, and patterns. The more detailed you can be about the factors that seem to influence your pain, the better. An accurate record of your pain will help your doctor give you the best treatment.\r\n\r\nWhy a Pain Journal Works for Chronic Pain\r\nThis information is useful both for you and your doctor. It can be used to help identify patterns of pain, such as time of day or level of stress, or pain triggers from certain activities. A pain journal can also show what doesn‚Äôt increase your pain, which can help you make better decisions about how you spend your day. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you log in a pain journal? Everybody uses their journal differently, but in this app you can do the following:\r\n- Give your pain a scale rating. We use the pain scale with the 0-10 rating system, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.\r\n- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.\r\n- Track the time of day pain occurs. \r\n- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. \r\n- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.\r\n- Write down what you ate and drank that day.\r\n- Describe your mood",

            "Looks super useful but can't input temozolomide's 5days on 23days off cycle. Probably better support for other cancers, but that's a deal breaker for brain cancer. Also, probably should differentiate between cancer symptoms and medication side effects. There is no way to input side effects in the past. When I am feeling sick, the last thing I want to do is mess with the phone. For heavy reactions, input is going to be retroactive, so good to support that I think."

Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",

It would be cool to be able to find friends without knowing their username, although I understand that most would probably prefer no mention of this app appear on their social media.",
            "Fun app, but definitely needs an update. Too many things just don't make sense. The poop drops before you have put in info so if you accidentally need to edit, you have to drop another then go back to delete. The feed doesn't update enough and hard to find follow requests. Camera feature needs more options as well. I could see the app really taking off if someone would just pay better attention to it, make it easier to do things, and give a makeover.",
            "I LOVE this app. I've convinced so many of my friends to join, and we're having the time of our lives. I would give five stars, but I have to take one off for how glitchy it is. I often have problems with the poop drop button, and it's just sort of laggy and weird in general. My other suggestion is that we should be able to see all the achievements we can accomplish so I know what to go after. And also, that our friends need to have different coloured pegs for each different account.",
            "This app is the most amazing concept ever, absolutely phenomenal. My only suggestion is you being able to label certain places so you can drop multiple poops in the same place or on the same pin. Right now, you can only drop pins on top of each other so it makes it appear like someone has pooped way more places than you when in reality they're logging everytime they poop in the same place. This really skews the statistics for leagues and such",
            "I love this but I wish you could add photos from your camera roll & if leagues had a discription next to it. Also if one day there was different reaction symbols, like fb, to react to poops with that'd be really cool. I like it though ‚ù§Ô∏è"

            "the title should read \"active\". \"Idle\" would mean it plays itself while you're away. Nope. Doesn't do that. And its very slow paced to be an active clicker game, but you can always upgrade it. you don't directly earn money, instead it goes to a bank, where you withdraw the money the money earned minus tax, or you can WATCH AN AD to earn 10x that. oh, and of course there's a premium currency that you can't legititmately earn outside of paying them or watching ads",

We would take turns and it would be so fun. 1 year ago I was looking on the app store for some games to play and Happy Poo Jump came up. I was so excited because I hadn't played it in ages. I downloaded it a played it. It was so much fun. I eventually collected enough coins to buy everything! Thank you for creating such a good and fun game. Thank you üòä",

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

In the word Mudra 'mud' means joy and 'ra' means produce. It produces joy and cheerfulness. Mudras originated from Hinduism and Buddhism. 200 Mudras are used in Bharatanatyam and 250 Mudras are in Mohiniattam, 108 Mudras used in Tantric rituals. In other terms Mudras are silent language of self expression and consisting of hand gestures and finger postures. \r\n\r\nMudras involve the entire body and looks as a closed electrical circuit which can pass energy throughout the body.

            "This app has helped me a lot for converting me into myself. But I wanna suggest one thing that if it can provide meditation music which keeps sounding utill the appointed time's up, it will give more effective results.As it breaks at every 10 to 15 seconds that's little bit annoying to concentrate. Thank You.üôÇ",
            "I gained much knowledge from this app, but I want to shed light towards the problem that the articles which come in notifications and are accessible through the app, cannot be read after they have been closed. What I mean is, it would have been good if there was a section to read the articles only... Other wise it is a good app.",
            "Love the intention behind this appüòç.. it not only teaches you abt different mudras but also provides you various options like mudras acc to body parts or benifits, precautions ets... the whole layout is sooo engaging, there is a timer attached, no need to open another app to record time while doing mudras... Last but not the least, love the random articles it have, small but inspiring!!!üëå",
            "Brilliant app... Using it from more than 2 yrs...and have recommended it to family and friends. Just want a personalized profile instead of going all the time in the list and checking the mudra for specific disorder. if u can ask initially and give related mudras on 1st page...and remaining in other pages would be helpful.",
            "Very very useful app. It is beautifully designed for individual body parts and this is user friendly also. I have tried 2 mudras as of now and feel my mind is relaxed. As some of the users have mentioned, kindly add a video tutorial for each of the mudras so that we can follow and practice in a correct way. Great team üëç thank you for this wonderful app"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "It's a very cute way to track my water intake and has shown me that even though I thought I was drinking enough water, I wasn't! You have to go to the options and enable all the sizes otherwise it yells at you for drinking too fast when adding two 8oz cups in a row rather than 16oz if you drink a water bottle.",
            "Took off a star because ot doesn't let me customize when not to get reminders. The app currently automatically excludes 10pm-8am from the reminder schedule for sleeping time. I wish it would let me set my own schedule for that. Other than that, the app works well and it's cute. Keep up the good work.",
            "You basically feed your plant it's awesome and you can also get yourself a cup still this game is really awesome no ads just the drinking too fast a sign and don't drink too much water sign just for those inferences it's awesome so I just gave it a four star hope you like it too try this out it's free and you are going to like it",
            "This app is a fun way to get me drinking the proper amount with cute plants and easy mechanics. Unfortunately the app notifications make no sound so I don't know to drink water unless I'm actively on my phone.",
            "I love using this app, but for the past couple of days it suddenly won't open correctly. I have to open and close the app at least 5 times before it will stay open. Not sure what happened, my phone hasn't updated this week, so that's not the problem. *Update: tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Worked once, now back to the app closing every time I try to open it."

Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand üòê cause of the translator. Please fix these issues üôÇ",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!üòÅ",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.üò£ everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by thisüòê"

When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",

            "Whenever I attempt to make a gif, the quality is destroyed and it stutters incredibly noticeably. If that doesn't happen, there's still the constant unresponsiveness to deal with. Half the time when I press a button or attempt to load something, the app just gives up. This includes trying to upload directly from giphy to another site, such as Instagram. This app only works once in a blue moon on the 13th day of every other month.",
            "Very excited to use the app since every article online recommended it. Well, I downloaded it twice, uploaded my own gif and when I try to share it with Instagram all I get is a green bar that says posting to Instagram amd nothing happens. I tried probably 10 times before giving up.",
            "Saving a gif to my device and opening it so it could save to my gallery revealed the worst quality I've ever seen anything on my phone. The effects available are.. whatever. The app in general is ok, haven't ran into any issues.",
            "this is my absolute favorite giph app,only problem is that it used to be an option on facebook messenger and now its gone,i downloaded from the app store but have no idea how to connect it to any other app so that it is easily accessible,so if i want to use it i have to go back and foudth and in and out of it and other apps to use it ,im a huge giph person and cuz of this reason i hardly ever use it,but wish it was easier cuz it is one of,if not the best gif making app,",
            "You can't paste a link to create a gif from a YouTube video? If it's possible, I can't find it. :( Edit: I deleted the app. It kept freezing up, there was no intuitive way to adjust the font style or size, & it would sometimes just go dark. This has to be some kind of platform glitch (Android) bc I can't imagine giphy being this lazy!"

        "description": "Hernia refers to a protrusion of body tissue through the wall of a cavity in which it is normally contained.\r\n\r\nAbout 10% of the population will have an abdominal hernia in their lifetime. It occurs in infants, children, and adults, in both males and females. The majority of abdominal hernia cases occur, however, in males.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, hernia poses an inconvenience. It can be uncomfortable, unsightly, painful, and even the cause of life-threatening complications. But do not let hernia restrict you or keep you from the activities you enjoy. Consult a doctor to diagnose the type of hernia you are suffering from, and what preventive measures you can take. Hernia usually requires surgery, and even after surgery, one has to take extra measures to prevent the problem from rising again.\r\n\r\nIn yoga, there are precautionary and preventive methods to help avoid or overcome hernia. Learning more about hernia is a good start in going about the problem.\r\n\r\nYoga Therapy\r\nProper practice of asanas and Pranayama can help prevent and treat hernia. Not all asanas and Pranayamas are suitable for those suffering from hernia, however; one needs guidance from an experienced teacher. Postures that stimulatem abdominal pressure, strengthen the core, and require heavy lifting or vigorous breathing, for instance, should be avoided.\r\n\r\nYoga can help drive away symptoms and at times completely cure some forms of hernia like inguinal hernia. Inverted postures are the best treatments for hernia. Inversions use gravity to relieve the pressure from the abdominal wall and place the hernia back in the position of the abdomen. Regular practice of pranayama and complete relaxation will not only help tackle the hernia but improve the life style.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to change the life habits. For instance, take proper precautions and adopt appropriate techniques while lifting heavy weights. Maintain normal body weight to avoid obesity. Avoid constipation by eating plenty of fibres, such as vegetables, drinking plenty fluid, going to the bathroom as soon as you have the urge, and exercising regularly.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the symptoms of hernia continue to persist or if the hernia is severe, surgery may be the ultimate and only option.

            "Good app. I needed it to find out how much milk my little one was getting every feed. I hate having to calculate his weight to ounces, especially in the middle of the night. If I could enter pounds and ounces there this app would have gotten a 5 star rating... this was on the verge of a 3 because I'm so annoyed with that part.",
            "Very helpful app. With little sleep that moms get - the app helps to have everything recorded. User friendly, everything is intuitive. Recommend.",
            "Very good app. User friendly. Gave 4 stars as sometimes the play/pause button freezes and doesn't work.",
            "I'm a first time parent that has been using this app since Day 1 of my son's life and it's been really helpful. Might take getting used to always remember to update things on it, but works wonders. Especially when I'm tired and I want to backtrack his record for the last few hours to see what was completed and for how long. Highly recommended to first time parents. You will certainly enjoy it.",
            "Helpful. I'm using app from begging of baby adventure and I need to admit I am already addicted. Sometimes app changes language itself to English, despite I have set other one in settings."

            "Would give it 5 star but seriously after every turn there is an add.. It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",
            "30 second ads, 20 second gameplay, rinse, repeat. Greedy ad revenue grab by developer. Hey developers, are you listening? It's actually faster to play the game, start an ad, force quit the game and restart the game. That's faster than watching an ad every single time.",
            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

Belum lagi nanti terasa sakit dan berdarah saat buang air besar. Bila dibiarkan, sering sembelit ini bisa berdampak buruk untuk kesehatan. Mulai dari ambeien sampai gangguan di usus pencernaan.\r\n\r\nMemang sudah banyak obat sembelit yang bisa kita dapat di pasaran. Namun, orang tua kita zaman dulu punya obat-obat pencahar alami yang bisa kamu praktikkan. Sebelum terburu-buru menemui dokter dan minta obat kimia, tentu tidak ada salahnya kalau kita coba dulu ramuan yang alami. Untuk kamu yang sering kesulitan buang air besar, coba deh tips-tips mengatasi BAB tak lancari ini,\r\n1. Pepaya dan air putih banyak-banyak adalah cara paling sederhana. Buah yang satu ini memang sudah terbukti ampuhnya\r\n\r\nMemang kurang pas kalau ini disebut ramuan. Soalnya pepaya bisa langsung kamu makan tanpa harus ditambahkan apa-apa. Buah manis ini mengandung enzim papain yang bisa membantu usus besar untuk mencerna protein dengan baik. Kandungan seratnya juga sangat tinggi sehingga bisa membantu melancarkan pencernaan. Buah pepaya adalah solusi kuno yang terbukti manjur untuk mengatasi sembelit. Supaya BAB lancar, sebaiknya kita mengonsumsi setengah buah pepaya setiap harinya. Kombinasikan juga dengan minum air putih banyak-banyak, sehingga feses yang keras bisa dilunakkan dan mudah dibuang.\r\n2. Pahit luar biasa sih. Tapi si buah ajaib mengkudu punya banyak kelebihan untuk membantu pencernaannmu\r\n\r\nMengkudu atau pace seringkali dianggap buah ajaib karena khasiatnya yang multifungsi. Mengkudu mengandung alkaloid triterpenoid dan moridon atau zat berwarna merah yang berfungsi sebagai pencahar. Ada banyak cara mengonsumsi mengkudu.\r\n\r\nAmbil dua buah mengkudu yang sudah masak, cuci bersih kemudian parut hingga halus. Beri sedikit garam, lalu peras dengan kain. Bisa juga dijus atau direbus dan diminum airnya.\r\n\r\nRasanya memang pahit luar biasa. Tapi yang namanya obat, pasti tidak enak rasanya.\r\n3. Daun bayam memang kaya serat dan gizi. Kegunaannya bisa kamu jadikan obat saat BAB tak lancar datang\r\n\r\nBayam atau Amaranthus spp kita kenal sebagai sayuran dengan kandungan zat besi tinggi yang bisa mengatasi anemia atau kurang darah. Tapi makanan kesukaan pelaut Popeye ini punya banyak fungsi lainnya, lho. Kandungan asam folat dan asam oksalatnya bisa membantu mengatasi kolesterol, asma, gangguan kulit dan rambut. Dicampur dengan madu, bayam juga bisa menjadi ramuan pencahar alami yang efektif.\r\n\r\nCaranya: cuci dua ikat bayam hingga bersih, dan giling sampai halus. Tambahkan secangkir air matang dan satu sendok madu. Aduk rata, peras dan saring. Minum tiga kali sehari bila kamu sedang mengalami sembelit.\r\n\r\n4. Biji-bijian dan gandum juga bisa jadi obat. Kalau malas repot, beli saja roti gandum di minimarket\r\n\r\nDalam kasus biasa, sembelit terjadi karena kurangnya serat yang masuk ke tubuh.

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

And says outlandish number of seconds until the game starts like 2868 seconds until the game starts and then all sudden I'm starting to game and then it kicks me out when there is 20 bingos left and says game over and then kicked me out saying that there's a data error",
            "*Update: 10-7-20 I haven't played for a while and I have no clue how to turn on Epic or whatever, but I also just lost 60 tickets! I bought 1 card in Candy Crush and accidentally hit the back button, even before the game had started and went straight back in and it took my tickets and didn't even give me my card!! Smh! * Love the game but there's only like 18 bingos per 180 cards. Need more bingos and I'll give u 5 stars! It's no fun when u rarely win a bingo!",
            "Great, fun game; BUT do not be fooled, this company is out to rip you off. The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things. I understand charging for lots of extras, but then your money doesn't even go anywhere.. these are fake items on a phone ppl are purchasing.",

You suck! I have logged in and out of FB numerous times, still not fixed! I uninstalled and re-installed this game 3 times; still cannot open gift box, today's Tasks , and now the icon has disappeared where you can do the daily and royal challenge, WTH!!!!! You need to fix your ridiculous technical issues!!!#",

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",

I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",

I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",

I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",

        "description": "Causes Of Hemorrhoids¬†\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of hemorrhoids may be due to varied grounds. The blood veins, which are in the rectal region, will respond to tension that is being strained in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, the tension may come from different origins and may lead to hemorrhoids to be a troublesome condition, and also, cause pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing well-informed about the different reasons behind hemorrhoids can aid to transform your life in avoiding hemorrhoids from inflicting intolerable pain.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstipation¬†\r\n\r\nConstipation is the most common cause for hemorrhoids. Tension in the anal area is caused by the bowel movements, if a person is constipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will consequently put strain on the blood veins, leading them to become inflamed and irritated. Bleeding in this area is seen, if you are constipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is from the blood veins responding to the tension from the bowel movements. In sequence, you may be required to be adept on how to avoid constipation by means of various methods.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPregnancy\r\n\r\nAfter constipation, pregnancy is the most typical reasons for hemorrhoids. This may be caused by different reasons. For instance, the continual tension that is happening in the blood veins in the rectal area can cause irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn turn, the blood veins will work harder as a result of a drastic increase of hormone levels. This will then put tension on them, resulting from inflammation and irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a patient is pregnant or expecting to be pregnant, it is very important to know that this is a normal part of pregnancy. However, it is only for a limited period of time and will usually disappear after you have given birth.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPortal Hypertension\r\n\r\nAnother reason for hemorrhoids is portal hypertension. This is caused by too much pressure from the blood veins that protrude from the intestines to the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently, this will lead to a smoother bowel movement and pressure from the blood veins and will cause hemorrhoids as a result. The various kinds of hemorrhoids that happen can lead to irritation and strain, as well as bleeding in the rectal and anal area.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic Venous Insufficiency\r\n\r\nThis condition happens when the blood veins in the rectal region are delicate, and can easily be damaged. This put tension on the vessels, as they will have to put extra effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically, the tension is also worsened with prolonged sitting or standing. If you are overweight, do not exercise habitually or you are smoking, it can also result to irritated blood veins.¬†\r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammatory bowel disease may also cause hemorrhoids. This happens when you are constipated or you have diarrhea, as well as stomach pain from problems with your digestive system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may lead to hemorrhoids to react since there is extra tension that is placed on the blood veins. This is very common if the condition is based on constipation.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving hemorrhoids, it isbest to seek out what is the origin of hemorrhoids and why it is happening. After that, you can change specific parts of your lifestyle, such as your food intake to help avoid the hemorrhoids from being an incessant trouble.¬†",

Tension in the anal area is caused by the bowel movements, if a person is constipated.<br><br><br><br>This will consequently put strain on the blood veins, leading them to become inflamed and irritated. Bleeding in this area is seen, if you are constipated.<br><br><br><br>This is from the blood veins responding to the tension from the bowel movements. In sequence, you may be required to be adept on how to avoid constipation by means of various methods.¬†<br><br><br><br>Pregnancy<br><br>After constipation, pregnancy is the most typical reasons for hemorrhoids. This may be caused by different reasons. For instance, the continual tension that is happening in the blood veins in the rectal area can cause irritation.<br><br><br><br>In turn, the blood veins will work harder as a result of a drastic increase of hormone levels. This will then put tension on them, resulting from inflammation and irritation.<br><br><br><br>If a patient is pregnant or expecting to be pregnant, it is very important to know that this is a normal part of pregnancy. However, it is only for a limited period of time and will usually disappear after you have given birth.¬†<br><br><br><br>Portal Hypertension<br><br>Another reason for hemorrhoids is portal hypertension. This is caused by too much pressure from the blood veins that protrude from the intestines to the liver.<br><br><br><br>Consequently, this will lead to a smoother bowel movement and pressure from the blood veins and will cause hemorrhoids as a result. The various kinds of hemorrhoids that happen can lead to irritation and strain, as well as bleeding in the rectal and anal area.¬†<br><br><br><br>Chronic Venous Insufficiency<br><br>This condition happens when the blood veins in the rectal region are delicate, and can easily be damaged. This put tension on the vessels, as they will have to put extra effort.<br><br><br><br>Basically, the tension is also worsened with prolonged sitting or standing. If you are overweight, do not exercise habitually or you are smoking, it can also result to irritated blood veins.¬†<br>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBS)<br><br><br><br>Inflammatory bowel disease may also cause hemorrhoids. This happens when you are constipated or you have diarrhea, as well as stomach pain from problems with your digestive system.<br><br><br><br>It may lead to hemorrhoids to react since there is extra tension that is placed on the blood veins. This is very common if the condition is based on constipation.¬†<br><br><br><br>Having hemorrhoids, it isbest to seek out what is the origin of hemorrhoids and why it is happening. After that, you can change specific parts of your lifestyle, such as your food intake to help avoid the hemorrhoids from being an incessant trouble.¬†",

This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",

Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",

I was thinking of buying a water bottle with the hour reminder marks on it, but I already have sooo many nice water tumblers so I didn't want to spend the extra money. This app allows me to create my own reminder schedule. I set it to remind me every 1/2 hour. I'd definitely recommend it to others.",

            "Great app. I can set my goals, and the reminder reminds me like it should. It's helped me stay on track with my water consumption, which has been a key element to my successful weight loss along with healthy eating habits and more movement (down almost 20 pounds). Great ap!",
            "This app is simple to use, the reminders work well but they aren't annoying like some other apps I've tried. It's nice how they break it down into smaller portions, it makes the goal seem doable instead of thinking you have an ocean of water to drink!"

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers ü§ò‚úåüòé",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "Constant pop ups wanting you to purchase. You have to say no to 3 ads in a row before you can spin again. A few spins later...there they are again. Hit what they consider a \"big win\" which can be quite often and guess what??? AD!!! Wanting you to multiply your winning by paying $4.99. I played for maybe 5 minutes and had to say \"No\" to so many pop-ups that I am uninstalling and never playing this game again.",
            "LOVE this slot game! I play a lot of slots, but usually delete them because you don't win and barely get enough in the daily bonus to keep playing. This one however is perfect! Lots of fun slots with different exciting bonuses on every slot (which is a must have for me, I don't like basic slots) and you ACTUALLY win! I LOVE it! Easy 5 star rating (:",
            "Early still, but it has cool slots and at least if you lose your ass, you can watch ads to earn yourself back into the game pretty quickly. That's a huge plus for me. I absolutely hate slot games that give a crappy bankroll to start and drains it in no time just to try to sell coin packages. We'll designed and big game selection too. Keep up the good work!",
            "I haven't seen \"buy this\" pop ups THIS awful since the late 90s just before pop up blockers were made to stop the disgusting greedy bs. This developer needs to get a grip. I was getting PAID to play this and try it out and I'm doing it is THAT bad. They need to rethink their policy on that. For real. Someone on their team probably deserves to be fired for this not happy nostalgia, this needs to stop. 100% trash till then. Update: just bc there's an x doesn't make the avalanch of pop ups okay.",
            "This game was great after I paid a couple bucks for a purchase to make ads go away (been playing nearly 2 yrs). But now, the Level Race and the Winning Cards are super annoying and interfere with tournaments. I get that you want to give people other options to get more coins, but you should also give players the option to opt out of these things. I buy the coins on my own and being harassed by these constant pop-ups is a deterrent. Once my coins are exhausted I'll likely just delete the app."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "The overall system/hub is great. However, this app is slow and clunky. Classic was better. It takes some time to load everything on launch before I can do anything. Then, when you go into a device, there's only a tiny space on the sides to scroll. Otherwise, if you scroll in the middle fast, it won't scroll, gotta go slow and it looks like it wants to select an option. You simply cannot scroll past a color wheel for a light because you'll just be selecting a color instead of scrolling. Annoying.",
            "Could use a little work. Looks are better than the features. I wish for the oven connection, I didn't have to start while right in front of it and rather be able to at least start keep warm to get the oven started. Also that you have to stop oven to change which to a different setting then have to be once more right in front of oven to begin the new setting. I do understand it for security, but I think there should be a way to also disable temp for more secure homes.",
            "If anyone else in your home uses the app to do something on the tv it basically makes your app unusable for the rest of the day. My wife used it and I try to use it a few minutes later to change the settings on my tv and I'm stuck in an infinite sign in loop. It's stupid. Why even add a feature to add other accounts to the group if only one can even navigate the app at a time?",
            "Edit: Still not compatible with Android 11. I've been paying monthly for my smart Tracker service that I'm not able to use. This is unacceptable from such a large company. Not compatible with Android 11 can use my tracker anymore. Reached out to support and they told me an official version of Android is not supported... Reached out to support again and they said android 11 isn't supported because it's in beta. It hasn't been in beta for almost a month now and I can't use my smart Tracker.",
            "The app says we have to download an add on. I press download and it says we can't download it, contact us. I contacted several times and didn't get any feedback. Well done guys. Even when it works, the touchpad works only once !!! After that you have to restart the app to use the touchpad But, someone's you can't even stop the app."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.",

I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them üôÇüñï",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

Update 10/15: daily bonus fails - check in same time every day - never get to day 7 award any longer. On top of incessant ads to just play, this is going on my 'only if I'm desperate & totally bored' pile. A real shame it has deteriorated to this.",

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "The cloud itself is pretty fine, but the app is weak in terms of a cloud app. It can't check file checksum to see if the file already exists so that it doesn't re-upload it. Multi selection of the items are not possible, you should select them manually by hand, which is funny! Recently I've seen some instances of users complaining that pCloud or other 3rd parties scan your files to check if there are any so called \"illegal\" files and they terminate your account. This is the opposite of privacy!",
            "No way to upload files and open new folders. Yet it reads: \"created folder\": \"uploaded files\". Network ok. Other fully functional apps. Update today 22/10/2020. Version2.11.2. But already with the previous version ie version 2.9.1 I had the same problems. But momentary, not like today. Thanks for the attention. Good job . In Trust I always leave 3 stars. GOOD DAY .Review update 22/10/2020 All solved for now. Thanks for the effort, the commitment and the seriousness. Let's go to 4‚≠ê",

Then this is for you, the media streaming facility is excellent. I've compared it's lifetime plan against Google drive, idrive, purchasing a nas. It's without a doubt the most sensible choice.",
            "Still now it's good to use. But one think I want to know,after installing day to now present time, how much MB (products) I upload on this \"pCloud\" free cloud storage,I found 1 thing is not going well, For ex:- supposed that, I upload 20 MB on this 'pCloud\" store,but the problem is I see,everytime I upload any file any size,after completing upload,if I go settings-app & notification-click on this \"pCloud\" I see as much (MB/GB) upload on \"pCloud\" storage,this app size will also expend the same.",
            "This company isn't able to repair a bug in the audio player reported 8 months ago. After I sent a reminder I got a reply saying: \"Be advised that your feedback has been provided to the Android team months ago. You don't need to worry, we are already working on a new and improved Audio player.\" - That was in July, no change since then.

        "description": "Acid Reflux Diet & Lifestyle Solution | Is there anyone who has not heard countless commercials to pop a pill to relieve acid reflux? Acid reflux is the flow of stomach acid back into the esophagus. A common symptom is heartburn - a burning discomfort felt anywhere from the stomach up into the chest and throat. Instead of pills, many health experts now recommend an acid reflux diet and other lifestyle solutions. In this app, learn what they are.\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs because acid reflux can become a serious, chronic condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. GERD can have several unpleasant symptoms that include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, dry sore throat, and coughing, as well as heartburn. Depending on their severity, these symptoms can significantly impair daily quality of life. Worse yet, GERD can lead to life-threatening conditions, including esophageal ulcers and cancer.\r\n\r\nSo why not just take the medications that neutralize stomach acid or restrict its production? The problem is, except for the most serious cases of GERD, these drugs are not meant for long-term or continual use. Over time, they can have negative side effects. Antacids can eventually upset the digestive tract and lead to diarrhea or constipation. Proton pump inhibitors like Prevacid and Prilosec, which are used to reduce the production of stomach acid, have been linked to increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease), pneumonia, and negative drug interactions.\r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, the many pills now available to treat acid reflux have done little to curtail its incidence. Approximately 40% of adult Americans now suffer from acid reflux. And shockingly, rates of esophageal cancer in the U.S. have increased 500% since the 1970s. Research, particularly a recent study from Denmark following more than 9, 800 GERD sufferers, has linked proton pump inhibitors with increase risk of esophageal cancer.\r\n\r\nThe first step in reducing GERD is often to limit foods that set off reflux. These ‚Äútrigger foods‚Äù differ from person to person but often include chocolate, coffee, fried foods, peppermint, spicy foods, and carbonated beverages.\r\n\r\nAvoid lying down for at least two hours after a meal or after drinking acidic beverages, like soda, or other caffeinated beverages. This can help to prevent stomach contents from flowing back into the esophagus.",
