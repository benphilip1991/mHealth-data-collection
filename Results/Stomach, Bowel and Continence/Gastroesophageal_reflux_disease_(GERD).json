            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in handüòÅ",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

Acid reflux is the flow of stomach acid back into the esophagus. A common symptom is heartburn - a burning discomfort felt anywhere from the stomach up into the chest and throat. Instead of pills, many health experts now recommend an acid reflux diet and other lifestyle solutions. In this app, learn what they are.\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs because acid reflux can become a serious, chronic condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. GERD can have several unpleasant symptoms that include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, dry sore throat, and coughing, as well as heartburn. Depending on their severity, these symptoms can significantly impair daily quality of life. Worse yet, GERD can lead to life-threatening conditions, including esophageal ulcers and cancer.\r\n\r\nSo why not just take the medications that neutralize stomach acid or restrict its production? The problem is, except for the most serious cases of GERD, these drugs are not meant for long-term or continual use. Over time, they can have negative side effects. Antacids can eventually upset the digestive tract and lead to diarrhea or constipation. Proton pump inhibitors like Prevacid and Prilosec, which are used to reduce the production of stomach acid, have been linked to increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease), pneumonia, and negative drug interactions.\r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, the many pills now available to treat acid reflux have done little to curtail its incidence.

        "description": "There are countless persons out there who are living a life of misery while suffering from various diseases like obesity, heart burns and acid reflux. They would be seeking some kind of help. The good thing is that there is a simple and easy to do follow cure for all of these diseases.\r\n\r\nThat is nothing else but following a simple diet plan. This will completely uproot all three of them.\r\n\r\nAll you would need to do is to make a strategy, as per the consultation provided to you by your physician if you are on some medication, and stick to that plan.\r\n\r\nAn acid reflux diet plan does not merely comprises of adding quality food to your diet but it also means that you will have to blacklist some of your favorite stuff.\r\n\r\nAvoid consumption of foods that are high on fats such as milk and milk products, meat; and those which have a high acid content such as some specific soft drinks.\r\n\r\nThe best part about this is the fact that while you are eating some good nutritious food, you are also helping yourselves against obesity and at the same time against acid reflux disease as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is very important that you strictly follow the routine that you set for yourselves. You would have to keep self control and stick to your plan.\r\n\r\nIf you stop following the proper diet plan then you will go back to the point from where you initially began, and all of your problems will come back.\r\n\r\nSo What Are The Recommendations for The Ideal Diet Plan?\r\n\r\nThe food that you eat should be good for your overall health.

The best way of controlling the condition is through the means of a good acid reflux diet. An appropriate acid reflux diet greatly contributes in preventing and controlling the condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that excessive production of stomach digestive fluids aggravates the condition, an appropriate acid reflux diet should contain only foods that don‚Äôt add to the stomach‚Äôs acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA good acid reflux diet should exclude: foods that are rich in fat, citrus foods, tomato products, milk, caffeine-based products, spicy foods, fried foods, peppermint, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, avoid eating large amounts of foods that contain fat. By restricting the amount of fat in your acid reflux diet, you help normalize the activity of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen large amounts of fat-rich foods are ingested at once, the stomach can‚Äôt manage to digest it properly and attempts to dissolve it by secreting more digestive acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExclude spices and other irritants (preservatives, colorants) from your acid reflux diet and replace fast food with home-cooked meals. Although it is believed that dairy products have a calming effect on the stomach, milk can eventually increase the amount of gastric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk has a rebound action on the stomach, neutralizing the levels of digestive acid at first, only to increase the amount of digestive acid further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to avoid smoking and the consumption of alcohol. These factors are proved to increase the production of gastric acids inside the stomach and therefore can aggravate acid reflux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, try to reduce the consumption of foods and beverages that contain caffeine (coffee, cola, black tea, cocoa, chocolate). Although it is not exactly known how caffeine affects the normal activity of the stomach, it is best to exclude it from your acid reflux diet.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoods considered to be appropriate for people who suffer from acid reflux are: apples, bananas, cabbage, carrots, beans, peas, potatoes, rice, low-fat meat, bread, pasta and cereals.

I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

        "description": "A hiatus hernia is a type of hernia in which abdominal organs (typically the stomach) slip through the diaphragm into the middle compartment of the chest. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with symptoms such as a taste of acid in the back of the mouth or heartburn. Other symptoms may include trouble swallowing and chest pains. Complications may include iron deficiency anemia, volvulus, or bowel obstruction. The most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors include major trauma, scoliosis, and certain types of surgery.There are two main types: a sliding hernia, in which the body of the stomach moves up, and a paraesophageal hernia, in which an abdominal organ moves beside the esophagus. The diagnosis may be confirmed with endoscopy or medical imaging. Endoscopy is typically only required when concerning symptoms are present, symptoms are resistant to treatment, or the person is over 50 years of age.",

        "description": "A brief education on diet and the basics of acid reflux is usually given to patients upon diagnosis. The management related to acid reflux correlates to the foods we eat and the activities that we are involved in. It is very challenging to be compliant with any diet and to change our habits; however, many of us desire to review, from time to time, and comply when we realize the impact foods and activities have on our daily lives and sleep patterns. I hope that you find this review helpful.\r\n\r\nGastric Reflux\r\n\r\nMany patients with chronic lung disorders also have gastric reflux. Irritating acidic stomach juices leak out of the stomach and into the throat and esophagus, causing heartburn. The irritation results in muscle spasms in the throat. Common symptoms include frequent throat clearing, excessive mucous and soreness in the throat. Some patients have reflux with minimal symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe following are suggestions to assist in neutralizing the stomach acid, lessen the production of acid, and prevent acid from coming up into the esophagus. This information is not intended to be medical advice. Please consult with your doctor if you have specific questions regarding any of these suggestions.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n\r\nNo exercise 2 hours before sleep.\r\nDo not bend from the waist to tie shoes.  Better to sit and extend legs, bending at the knees.\r\nBe aware of body position when doing chores, such as loading washing machine, bend from the knees rather than bending from the waist.\r\nNo downward dog yoga poses 2 hours before bed.\r\nClothing that fits tightly across the midsection should be avoided.\r\nStress can worsen reflux symptoms; practice relaxation strategies such as meditation, exercise or yoga.\r\nEvening:\r\n\r\nNo more than 10 oz. of fluids after 6pm. Avoid eating 2-3 hours before lying down.\r\nThis includes anything that can turn to liquid, such as ice cream or yogurt. The bacteria in the stomach can be aspirated to the lungs in a liquid consistency.\r\nHead of bed raised 30-45 degrees, hips to shoulder level by purchasing plastic bed lifts. You can find them for, approximately $10.00 and they are easy to assemble\r\nOr\r\nPlacing cinder blocks, wood or special cones under the bed. The desired elevation ranges from 4-11 inches, with 8 being the average.\r\nPile 2-3 pillows under head and shoulders. Place another pillow under the thighs so that the body is in a v position to prevent sliding to a flat position. Wedge pillows also help.\r\nSleeping on your back is the best, left side is second best, never on your stomach or right side.",

        "description": "A brief education on diet and the basics of acid reflux is usually given to patients upon diagnosis. The management related to acid reflux correlates to the foods we eat and the activities that we are involved in. It is very challenging to be compliant with any diet and to change our habits; however, many of us desire to review, from time to time, and comply when we realize the impact foods and activities have on our daily lives and sleep patterns. I hope that you find this review helpful.\r\n\r\nGastric Reflux\r\n\r\nMany patients with chronic lung disorders also have gastric reflux. Irritating acidic stomach juices leak out of the stomach and into the throat and esophagus, causing heartburn. The irritation results in muscle spasms in the throat. Common symptoms include frequent throat clearing, excessive mucous and soreness in the throat. Some patients have reflux with minimal symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe following are suggestions to assist in neutralizing the stomach acid, lessen the production of acid, and prevent acid from coming up into the esophagus. This information is not intended to be medical advice. Please consult with your doctor if you have specific questions regarding any of these suggestions.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n\r\nNo exercise 2 hours before sleep.\r\nDo not bend from the waist to tie shoes.  Better to sit and extend legs, bending at the knees.\r\nBe aware of body position when doing chores, such as loading washing machine, bend from the knees rather than bending from the waist.\r\nNo downward dog yoga poses 2 hours before bed.\r\nClothing that fits tightly across the midsection should be avoided.\r\nStress can worsen reflux symptoms; practice relaxation strategies such as meditation, exercise or yoga.\r\nEvening:\r\n\r\nNo more than 10 oz. of fluids after 6pm. Avoid eating 2-3 hours before lying down.\r\nThis includes anything that can turn to liquid, such as ice cream or yogurt. The bacteria in the stomach can be aspirated to the lungs in a liquid consistency.\r\nHead of bed raised 30-45 degrees, hips to shoulder level by purchasing plastic bed lifts. You can find them for, approximately $10.00 and they are easy to assemble\r\nOr\r\nPlacing cinder blocks, wood or special cones under the bed. The desired elevation ranges from 4-11 inches, with 8 being the average.\r\nPile 2-3 pillows under head and shoulders. Place another pillow under the thighs so that the body is in a v position to prevent sliding to a flat position. Wedge pillows also help.\r\nSleeping on your back is the best, left side is second best, never on your stomach or right side.",

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",
            "I use it for my IBS and how bloated I am etc good reminder."

This can be helpful in reducing symptoms for people with IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, Colitis, Lactose Intolerance and various other food intolerances, food sensitivities, and stomach problems.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n- Comprehensive list of foods and whether or not they are low FODMAP foods, to make finding foods that won't exacerbate your IBS easier.\r\n- Search by food name and category.\r\n- General FODMAP Diet and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and - \r\n- Lactose Intolerence and other food sensitivities info.\r\n- Additional details on the specific breakdowns of each food and whether it is high, medium, or low in the main categories of Polyols, Oligos, Fructose, and Lactose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPremium Features Include:\r\nMy Experience - Log your personal experience with foods to determine if a food works for you regardless of its FODMAP content. Rate whether you had a good or bad reaction to a food after eating it, then leave detailed notes so that you know for next time how said food will affect you.\r\n\r\nCommunity Experience - See how the community has reacted to a food via anonymized My Experience ratings.

Once you've eliminated all high FODMAP foods from your diet, you can challenge foods to determine if they work for you.

They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose and galactooligosaccharides, disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols).\r\n\r\nThe term is an acronym, derived from:\r\n\r\n*Fermentable\r\n*Oligo-\r\n*Di-\r\n*Mono-saccharides\r\n*And\r\n*Polyols \r\n\r\nAlthough these specific carbs are naturally present in the foods we eat, diet restriction has been found to improve symptom control in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as Lactose Intolerance, Gluten Intolerance, Crohn's disease, Colitis, and other stomach sensitivities. Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms‚Äîincluding abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage.

However, indigestion may also be associated with more serious problems like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), an H. pylori bacterial infection, chronic stress/anxiety, obesity, or stomach ulcers. \r\n\r\nSymptoms typically include abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, heartburn and bloating.There are a number of ways to treat the symptoms of indigestion, and with a little preventative planning you can reduce the chances of indigestion symptoms arising in the future.

        "description": "A hiatal hernia is often known as a diaphragmatic hernia. Though most people are unaware that they suffer from one, it can be a serious problem if left untreated. Medically speaking, the hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes through the opening of the diaphragm (where stomach meets the esophagus).\r\n\r\nIf you are suffering from some type of reflux because of this disorder, it is now time to act and seek a natural treatment. My dad is a survivor of this problem and has been naturally cured over 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding hiatal hernias, and paraesophageal hiatal hernias.\r\n\r\nSliding hiatal hernias form when the stomach and the adjoining oesophagus slide up into the chest cavity through the diaphragm. It is more common.\r\n\r\nParaoesophgeal hernias are less common and it occurs when a portion of the stomach squeezes past the diaphragm and is lodged and strangulated in place beside the oesophagus. Such hernias can be asymptomatic but dangerous because the portion of stomach that is strangulated above the diaphragm will have a compromised blood supply.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, hiatal hernias are asymptomatic but sometimes patients might experience heartburn or reflux. While the two conditions appear to be linked, they do not independently cause the development of the other.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of heartburn, patients might experience chest pain instead and this can be confused with chest pain caused by cardiac issues.\r\n\r\nA hiatal hernia can be diagnosed with a specialized X-ray called a barium swallow that allows a doctor to see the esophagus or with endoscopy. The procedure involves the patient swallowing a radio-opaque liquid and having X-Rays of the chest and abdomen taken while in the erect posture. The radio-opaque liquid will outline the stomach lining and oesophagus, thereby demonstrating the presence/absence of the condition.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIf asymptomatic, no treatments are necessary. However, should the stomach become strangulated and there is a risk of vascular compromise to the stomach, surgery is usually needed to rectify the problem.\r\n\r\nOther associated symptoms such as reflux disease, heartburn and chest discomfort should be treated accordingly.",

        "description": "Whenever an internal body part pushes through an opening and into an area where it does not belong, it is called a hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper portion of the stomach protrudes into the chest cavity through an opening of the diaphragm called the esophageal hiatus. Ordinarily this opening is only large enough to accommodate the esophagus. When it becomes weakened and enlarged, however, the opening can allow passage of part of the stomach. In some cases, that portion of the stomach may even become entrapped.\r\n\r\nWhat is a hiatal hernia?\r\n\r\nA hiatal hernia occurs when portions on the stomach creep through the esophagael hiatus.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of hiatal hernia:\r\n\r\nThe sliding type occurs when the junction between the esophagus and the stomach slides through the esophageal hiatus when there is increased pressure in the stomach. When the pressure is relieved, gravity causes the stomach to slide back into place.\r\n\r\nThe fixed type, or paraesophageal¬≠, occurs when the upper portion of the stomach becomes entrapped and thus does not slide back into position. This is less common than the sliding variety, and is more apt to be symptomatic.\r\n\r\nHiatal Hernia Symptoms\r\n\r\nThe most common hiatal hernia symptoms are heartburn and/or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It should be noted that many patients are diagnosed with GERD, but do not have a hernia, while others have a hiatal hernia but do not suffer with GERD. Chest pains can also be symptomatic of hiatal hernia. The pains can be severe, and may be mistaken for a heart attack. Obviously, if such pains occur, one should consult with a physician right away. Getting to a doctor is essential to getting proper care in time.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nWhile specific causes are not really known, hiatal hernias have been associated with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Pregnancy and delivery\r\n\r\n2. Weight gain\r\n\r\n3. Increased abdominal pressure from chronic coughing\r\n\r\n4. Straining during difficult bowel movements\r\n\r\nSome people are predisposed to hiatal hernia due to congenital weakness or enlargement in the esophageal hiatus. Obesity and smoking have also been proven to increase the likelihood of hiatal hernia.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nMost people do not have symptoms and no treatment is needed. If symptoms do occur, initial treatment may include medication to control acid reflux (GERD), and a change in diet. Weight loss is often recommended as a means of reducing the pressure on the hernia. If symptoms are chronic and do not respond to diet and medication, surgery may become necessary. If the hernia is in danger of becoming restricted or strangulated, surgery becomes the likely treatment. Today, most surgeons elect to perform laparoscopic surgery, because it is minimally invasive and recovery time is reduced.\r\n\r\nIf a patient who has been diagnosed with hiatal hernia becomes nauseous, experiences severe chest pains, is vomiting, or is unable to have a bowel movement, it should be treated as a medical emergency. Consult with a physician immediately.\r\n\r\nHiatal hernia symptoms are commonly misunderstood, if you feel you may have a hiatal hernia you should contact a doctor to resolve a treatment method quickly.",

        "description": "Burning Issues On Heartburn\r\n\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôve just eaten a big meal and leaned back in your favorite chair to watch your favorite TV program. As you begin to relax, your chest starts to hurt so much it feels like it‚Äôs on fire. You may be experiencing heartburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to studies, about 30% of adults experience occasional heartburn, while 10% experience heartburn almost every single every day. Heartburn is common, and an occasional episode is generally nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, many people have already considered heartburn as a uncomfortable condition that requires medication or medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn usually follows after a heavy meal. To understand how this condition comes about, it is best to be aware of what exactly happens when we eat food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food that is swallowed travels from the mouth to the stomach through a hollow tube called the esophagus. Before food enters the stomach, it must pass through a tight muscle at the lower part of the esophagus called the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lower esophageal sphincter prevents food from traveling backward into the esophagus. Once in the stomach, stomach acid slowly digests the food. This acid is very strong and can damage most parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, the stomach is protected from its own acid by a special mucous layer. The esophagus, however, does not have any such special protection. If the lower esophageal sphincter does not close completely, the lower part of the esophagus can be damaged by stomach acid. When this happens, heartburn is experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn can last for several hours and is often worse after eating, or when lying down, or when a person who just ate suddenly bends over. Heartburn is the most common symptom of reflux. Reflux occurs when acid in the stomach, which is there to help digest food, rises up into the esophagus, causing pain, irritation, and discomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other factors that can make heartburn worse include certain foods such as fatty and spicy foods, chocolate, caffeine, onions, tomato sauce, carbonated beverages and mint. Alcohol, large meals, lying too soon after eating, cigarette smoking, sedatives, calcium channel blockers and antidepressant medications can also trigger heartburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn, also called acid indigestion, is the most common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); a disease in which stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back (refluxes) into the esophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn usually feels like a burning chest pain beginning behind the breastbone and moving upward to the neck and throat. Many people say it feels like food is coming back into the mouth leaving an acid or bitter taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost heartburn problems are mild, but if a person experiences frequent discomfort, there may already be some complications that need medical treatment or the use of prescription medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a person encounters heartburn several times a week, or if it returns soon after the effects of antacids wear off, medical attention may be necessary. A person with heartburn should also consult a doctor if he or she often wakes up at night due to discomfort brought about by reflux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne may need further medical care, or possibly even surgery, if a person experience difficulty swallowing, regurgitates blood or black material, suddenly loses weight, or if the stool is black in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people can manage the discomfort of heartburn with lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter medications. But if heartburn is severe, these remedies may offer only temporary or partial relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn pain can be mistaken for the pain associated with heart disease or a heart attack, but there are differences. Heartburn pain is less likely to be associated with physical activity. Exercise may aggravate pain resulting from heart disease, and rest may relieve the pain",

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

            "Really liked the actual sessions, but when I went to cancel my subscription I found that I couldn't and there isn't any phone number to contact the company. Very much turned off by this kind of subscription \"trap\", especially after spending so much on the app. Anyone at Nerva support, please CANCEL my subscription.",
            "Seems helpful so far. The price is a bit outrageous for basically 4 or 5 recorded audio sessions that seem to repeat over and over. Almost $100 total for access for only 6 weeks? The app interface could use some work as well. Not what I'd expect, especially given the cost.",
            "It's still too early to see how well it's working at this stage. However, I'm enjoying the sessions and finding that taking a few minutes out of my day to relax is nice. The app doesn't seem to automatically move from day to day though. I need to repeat the exercises on the next day to get it to move on. Not a big deal though as this is fairly easy to fix.",
            "Only just started to use this app but I am enjoying the sessions and find them very relaxing. Bit too early to see results at day three in any consistent way but more than happy to carry on with the program.",
            "The app helps me a lot. I'm only in the middle of my second week and I'm experiencing a massive relief with my IBS symptoms. I trust it will all get even better by the end of the program and the effects will be long lasting. Thanks!!!"

The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut.[3][4] The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.",

        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from theories related to osteoporosis research, however, most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, with the proposal that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, and low energy levels as well as other illnesses. Human blood is regulated at pH 7.35 to 7.45. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkaloids and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious, and the body has acid‚Äìbase homeostasis mechanisms that generally ensure this does not happen. The idea that these diets can materially affect blood pH for the purpose of treating a range of diseases is not supported by scientific research and makes incorrect assumptions about how alkaline diets function that are contrary to human physiology.\r\n\r\nDiets avoiding meat, poultry, cheese, and grains can be used in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH). However, difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of this diet have led to medications, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH. The \"acid-ash\" hypothesis was once considered a risk factor for osteoporosis, though the current weight of scientific evidence does not support this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nMedical aspects:\r\nAccording to the traditional hypothesis underlying this diet, acid ash is produced by meat, poultry, cheese, fish, eggs, and grains. Alkaline ash is produced by fruits and vegetables, except cranberries, prunes and plums.

        "description": "Constipation is a disorder of the digestive tract. When you suffer from constipation your bowels don't regularly move or they are not emptied completely. Unfortunately constipation can cause many diseases because this disorder produces many toxins and these can reach in the blood stream and in this way they are carried in all your body.\r\n\r\nPeople of all ages can suffer from constipation taking into account that it is one of the most common digestive disorders. Most of the time this disorder is just temporary and it can be treated very easy. A great attention must be paid to the chronic constipation. It must be not neglected because it can lead to hemorrhoids, fecal impaction, piles, fecal incontinence, and anal fissures.\r\n\r\nFortunately this digestive disorder can be treated very easy. More on, there are lots of natural treatments that can help you to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n\r\nConstipation has many symptoms: from difficulty, infrequency or irregularity in elimination of hard fecal matter, foul breath, loss of appetite, coated tongue, dizziness, headache, dark circles under the eyes to dark circles under the eyes, depression, ulcer in mouth, varicose veins, acidity, insomnia, pain in the lumbar region, constant fullness in the abdomen and varicose veins.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nThe main causes of constipation are a fault style of life and a fault diet. Stress can be a cause, too.\r\n\r\nNatural Treatments\r\n\r\nMost of the fruits except jack fruit and banana are very useful in constipation treatments. Of course some are more effective than others. For example Bael fruit is considered the best natural laxative. But there are many other fruits that can help you to treat this digestive disorder as well.\r\n\r\nPears are very beneficial to treat constipation. If you eat a pear during your breakfast or after dinner, its effects will be surprising.\r\n\r\nGuava is another natural remedy. If you eat it with seeds, it provides your diet roughage. Eat one or two guavas every day and you will not suffer from constipation anymore.\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that they are very tasty, grapes are a merciless enemy of constipation.\r\n\r\nGrapes contain sugar, organic acid and cellulose and this combination make them to be a great natural laxative. Besides the fact that they clear the bowels they also tone up intestines and the stomach. Eat at least 350 gm of grapes daily.\r\n\r\nOranges can help you, too. Eat one or two oranges at dinner and at breakfast and the problem is resoled. Figs and papaya are very useful, too. You can also treat your constipation with spinach. Squeeze half of a lime in a glass of hot water and mix it with 5 gm of salt. You can also swallow a teaspoon of linseed with a glass of water before your meals. Drinking a glass of water in which you put a teaspoon of honey is another way to get rid of constipation. Drink teas made from herbal known as good laxatives. Drink horse gowan tea for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will help you not to suffer from constipation.",

        "description": "Kidneys\r\n\r\nConcomitant to their name, kidneys are positioned at the back of the abdominal cavity. Kidneys execute some very vital functions in the human body. These entail formation of urine, balancing chemicals and fluids in the body and extracting waste from the bloodstream. Moreover, they assist various other organs in carrying out routine functions in the body.\r\n\r\nThe pre-eminent functions of the kidneys are as follows\r\n\r\n1. Blood Pressure Regulation\r\nKidneys require a consistent flow of blood to filter it. In case the blood pressure drops, kidneys immediately begin increasing it. This is attained by the production of a vessel-constricting protein known as angiotensin. The kidneys produce this protein to regulate blood pressure and signal the body to retain water and sodium.\r\n\r\n2. Waste Excretion\r\nThe human body accumulates harmful elements such as toxins, urea and excess salts over time. Kidneys facilitate the excretion of these harmful elements by filtering the bloodstream.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain Water Levels\r\nKidneys adjust their function to the level of water intake. If in case the water intake drops, kidneys help retain water in the body instead of flushing it through urine.\r\n\r\n4. Acid Regulation\r\nThe body‚Äôs environment can get acidic if the kidneys do not perform their balancing function. Kidneys filter out toxins and metals that can lead to increased acidity.\r\n\r\n5. Red Blood Cell Stimulation\r\nLike every organ kidneys require proper oxygenation to keep up their activity. In case of oxygen, deficiency kidneys release erythropoietin which stimulates the bone marrow and increases the production of red blood cells.\r\n\r\nKidney health is extremely crucial for the human body. Healthy nutrient-dense foods are necessary to maintain proper kidney function.\r\n\r\nDiet has a close relation to kidney health. Deficiency of vital nutrients can be the cause of kidney diseases and kidney failure. People in the advanced stages of kidney disease need to adopt a kidney-friendly diet to prevent kidney failure. Diet requirements vary depending on the stage of kidney disease, however, eating foods low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus can altogether prevent any abnormality in the kidney function.\r\n \r\nIf You like The App Pls Rate it 5 stars!!!",

After all, it works hard - without breaks - to keep you alive, so you should do your part and return the favor.\r\n\r\nWhy else is it important to maintain a healthy heart as you age?\r\n\r\nTaking great care of your heart to avoid cardiovascular disease is critical, but that shouldn't be your only motivator. There are many other reasons to proactively maintain a healthy heart:\r\n\r\n1. To maintain cholesterol and blood pressure\r\nHigh cholesterol levels increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but that's not all. Unhealthy cholesterol in the blood can also lead to heart attack and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure levels are even more threatening to your overall health. Besides a heightened risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure, you're also more likely to develop peripheral artery disease, angina, vision loss and kidney disease or failure.\r\n\r\n2. To reduce feelings of depression\r\nDid you know that cardiovascular disease can increase your chance of feeling depressed? Research shows that 33 percent of heart attack victims end up showing depressive symptoms, according to Barry Jacobs, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and director of Behavioral Sciences at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program.\r\n\r\n\"The big message is that people need to be aware of this connection,\" he told the American Heart Association, where he volunteers. \"The second message is that many treatments are available. No one needs to suffer.\"\r\nResearch shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.Research shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.\r\n\r\n3. To lower your risk of developing dementia\r\nThere's a connection between heart health and mental well-being, but it goes beyond feelings of depression. Research shows that poor heart health is also associated with dementia. When you don't properly take care of your heart - with smart lifestyle decisions - you're narrowing your blood vessels, which then limits the amount of blood that can get to the brain. Without proper blood flow, your brain can't work the way it's supposed to and you may have trouble making decisions, reasoning with others and remembering familiar faces and places.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate memory loss with Alzheimer's disease, and they think it can't be prevented or treated,\" said Ralph Sacco, M.D., chief of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and former president of the American Heart Association. \"But controlling your risk factors for heart disease can make a difference in slowing its progression.\"\r\n\r\nHow can I take better care of my heart?\r\nBy making smarter lifestyle choices, you can protect your heart and reduce your risk for developing life-threatening conditions. Making these small decisions can have a large impact on the health of your heart and your overall well-being:\r\n\r\n    Follow a heart-healthy diet\r\n    By eating more nutritious foods and removing unhealthy fats from your diet, you can fuel a thriving heart, reduce your blood and cholesterol levels and maintain your weight, according to the Heart Foundation. Eat more fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, and limit your salt and alcohol intake.\r\n   \r\nDownload the application and learn about foods that prevent heart diseases and maintain a healthy heart.\r\n\r\nGood luck to all and hope the remedies in this application will help you keep a healthy heart \r\n\r\nConsider sharing  this application to family and friends, it would be a huge support to rate this App five star so that people can easily find it in the store.\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out this App!!",

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

I also like how you match on diagnosis and symptoms so if you're searching for a diagnosis, you might be able to find clues as to what's going on through symptoms you match on with other people who have been diagnosed. Hoping this will be a game changer for me ü¶ì",

Symptoms may vary from mild to severe and usually begin six to thirty days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. Weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and headaches also commonly occur. Diarrhea is uncommon and vomiting is not usually severe. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium Salmonella typhi, also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate. Symptoms are similar to that of many other infectious diseases.Typhus is a different disease.",

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from the acid ash hypothesis, which primarily related to osteoporosis research. Most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, who propose that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and other illnesses. Human blood is maintained between pH 7.35 and 7.45 by acid‚Äìbase homeostasis mechanisms. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkalosis and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious. The idea that these diets can materially affect blood pH for the purpose of treating a range of diseases is not supported by scientific research and makes incorrect assumptions about how alkaline diets function that are contrary to human physiology.\r\n\r\nWhile diets avoiding meat, poultry, cheese, and grains can be used in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH), difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of these diets have led to medications, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH.

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get.

Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ‚ù§ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",

I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

        "title": "Stomach Pain",
        "description": "Stomach ache and abdominal pain\r\nA stomach ache is a term often used to refer to cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It's usually short-lived and is often not serious.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis ‚Äì the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer ‚Äì a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones ‚Äì small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis ‚Äì inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS ‚Äì a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ‚Äì long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning ‚Äì in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain ‚Äì painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems ‚Äì such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help.

Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

        "description": "Cause Of Asthma and how to cure, You may be wondering what the cause of asthma is, especially if you are keen to reduce the severity and frequency of your attacks. Asthma is a respiratory condition that can have an impact on the quality of your life. With an asthma attack, you feel weakened considerably and may not be able to function normally. However, instead of feeling helpless, find ways to better deal with it and to take responsibility for your own health.\r\n\r\nMore topics will be discuss in this app:\r\n\r\n- asthma symptoms\t\r\n- asthma treatment\t\r\n- asthma definition\r\n- asthma attack\r\n\r\nFeatures of the app:\r\n\r\nCan Use For Offline App\r\nUpdated regularly\r\nYou can ask questions to us for more idea about content.\r\nSimple app book Knowledge like pocket on your phone\r\nYou can also send us your suggestions and we will add them inside the app For more updates.\r\n\r\nRead more here about causes of asthma:\r\n\r\nYou must first realize that not all asthma is the same, in finding out what the cause of asthma is. Several different types of asthma have different triggers.\r\n\r\n- Allergic asthma is when the symptoms are triggered by allergens that the sufferer comes into contact with. Some of the most common triggers in allergic asthma are dust, pollen, pet dander, etc. An avoidance or reduced exposure to these triggers can help substantially. Most children who are diagnosed with asthma suffer from allergic asthma. Smoking during pregnancy and while children are young can make them more vulnerable to allergic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Exercise-induced asthma is when your asthma symptoms only occur during strenuous exercise. This asthma is due to the fact that the lungs lose their moisture and heat during times of strenuous activity. Coughing is the most common symptom observed with this type of asthma, although there may be more severe symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Intrinsic asthma is when the symptoms are not linked to a particular allergy. Some of the triggers in intrinsic asthma are perfume, smoke and cold air, cleaning fumes, an upper respiratory infection, and GERD or gastroesophageal reflux. Patients who begin having allergy symptoms after the age of 40 most often suffer from intrinsic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Occupational asthma occurs when you begin having asthma symptoms due to being in contact with dust, fumes, chemicals, or other irritants over a long period of time at work. This makes working very difficult. You may want to change your working environment for the sake of your health.\r\n\r\n- Nocturnal asthma occurs when you suffer from allergy symptoms while sleeping. It can be triggered by bedding allergens or other allergens located in your bedroom, GERD, or a decrease in the temperature of the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you learn more about your cause of asthma to determine how best to control or avoid your triggers. It is possible to lead a more normal life, free of the many miserable allergy symptoms, if you learn how to best take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nDownload causes of asthma app for learn more information.",

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.üò£ everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by thisüòê"

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. üò°",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",

Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",

            "I've been using this since my Oppo A37 (very old model) until now with my Oppo Reno 4. And this works very great on both! It stops my battery draining very fast like normally it decreases every minute but ever since I am using this app, my battery life can continue for another 2 hours. I can't live without this. Please don't try to update this like there were so many changes, I like it to be this simple already. Thank you!!!!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews but I felt that I should with this one. I have a Galaxy s8 plus. It's an awesome phone except for the battery, especially after the last update. I took a chance and downloaded Greenify and noticed a difference the first day. My battery definitely lasts MUCH longer and the bonus is there's no ANNOYING ADS! Seems to be a great app so far.",
            "This app called greenfy.apk, please this app helps with hybernating and closing all background apps running at your background and draining your battery live span. It works perfectly on both rooted and non-rooted devices. It will show you all the system and non system apps running currently and the time you started running those up and stiil counting!!! Then you can either choose to hybernate it or let it run so, I think this app is perfect for those using iPhone and we the Android lover",
            "I've always used this app, no matter what device I use. Now I'm using RealMe 5 Pro (not rooted), and I decided to finally purchase the donate version, and it somehow doesn't work :/ when it force closes an app, the next app's 'Force Close' option is grayed out, so in the end, I have to force close each one individually. I really love this app, and I'm hoping for a fix soon.",
            "I have been using Greenify for years now and it has saved me so many times when I am out and about by saving battery for me. One thing to note is that it is not for those who don't know what they are doing. With that said, Greenify should include more instructions and short explanations(such as the meaning of backgroud-free). A lot of bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works and don't know it's limitations."

My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."
