Medications involved include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication. It is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter (the junction between the stomach and the esophagus). Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.\r\n\r\nTreatment is typically via lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, losing weight, avoiding certain foods, and stopping smoking. Medications include antacid, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.\r\n\r\nremedies: chewing gum, licorice, aloe, slippery elm, apple cider vinegar\r\ncauses: alcohol, chocolate, fried foods (e.g. french fries), mint, onions, garlic, tomatoes\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nWe do not perform any testing ourselves.

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in handüòÅ",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

It is designed to easily and quickly register your acid -reflux, heartburns or GERD including reflux symptoms, heartburn medications that you took.\r\n\r\nGastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD more commonly known as Acid-reflux, heartburn, is a digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach. Many people, including pregnant women, suffer from heartburn or acid-reflux, indigestion caused by GERD. Doctors believe that some people also suffer from GERD due to a condition called hiatal hernia.

It's not just about the food you eat. What else could be triggering your discomfort?  The best way to find out is to keep a ‚Äútrigger log‚Äù for at least one week. You should take note of all the foods and beverages you consume, as well as all the medications that you take and the symptoms you feel.

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. üòä",

        "description": "Appropriate Acid Reflux Diet\r\n\r\n\r\nAcid reflux can become very serious if it is not appropriately treated and can even lead to severe complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factors responsible for causing acid reflux are multiple: low pressure in the region of the esophagus, inappropriate activity of the lower esophageal sphincter (a muscular valve at the union between the esophagus and the stomach), excessive production of digestive acid or physiological abnormalities of the esophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcid reflux may also occur due to inappropriate diet, stress and unhealthy lifestyle. The best way of controlling the condition is through the means of a good acid reflux diet. An appropriate acid reflux diet greatly contributes in preventing and controlling the condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that excessive production of stomach digestive fluids aggravates the condition, an appropriate acid reflux diet should contain only foods that don‚Äôt add to the stomach‚Äôs acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA good acid reflux diet should exclude: foods that are rich in fat, citrus foods, tomato products, milk, caffeine-based products, spicy foods, fried foods, peppermint, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, avoid eating large amounts of foods that contain fat. By restricting the amount of fat in your acid reflux diet, you help normalize the activity of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen large amounts of fat-rich foods are ingested at once, the stomach can‚Äôt manage to digest it properly and attempts to dissolve it by secreting more digestive acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExclude spices and other irritants (preservatives, colorants) from your acid reflux diet and replace fast food with home-cooked meals. Although it is believed that dairy products have a calming effect on the stomach, milk can eventually increase the amount of gastric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk has a rebound action on the stomach, neutralizing the levels of digestive acid at first, only to increase the amount of digestive acid further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to avoid smoking and the consumption of alcohol. These factors are proved to increase the production of gastric acids inside the stomach and therefore can aggravate acid reflux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, try to reduce the consumption of foods and beverages that contain caffeine (coffee, cola, black tea, cocoa, chocolate). Although it is not exactly known how caffeine affects the normal activity of the stomach, it is best to exclude it from your acid reflux diet.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFoods considered to be appropriate for people who suffer from acid reflux are: apples, bananas, cabbage, carrots, beans, peas, potatoes, rice, low-fat meat, bread, pasta and cereals. Include more foods that are rich in carbohydrates in your acid reflux diet (price, pasta, bread, cereals, potatoes) and try to reduce the intake of protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may eat light meats such as chicken or fish, but try to place meat products on a secondary level in your acid reflux diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow a good acid reflux diet and you will quickly improve your condition. In some cases, an appropriate acid reflux diet can even be a substitute for medication.",

A common symptom is a heartburn - a burning discomfort felt anywhere from the stomach up into the chest and throat.\r\n\r\nAbout GERD:\r\n\r\nRisk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatus hernia, and taking certain medicines. Medications involved include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication. It is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter (the junction between the stomach and the esophagus). Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.\r\n\r\nTreatment is typical via lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, losing weight, avoiding certain foods, and stopping smoking. Medications include antacids, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.\r\n\r\nYour lifestyle must be implemented along with this type of diet, do exercise regularly, have good enough sleep every night (sleep early), quit smoking, eat more natural low in fat and sugar such as fruits, veggies, whole grains, non-fat dairy, and fish. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Don‚Äôt lie down or go to sleep after eating. Eat earlier in the evening, preferably before 7.00 pm.\r\n\r\nFollowing these acid reflux diet and lifestyle-related modifications can greatly increase your chances of living without the unpleasant symptoms of acid reflux, and, in the long run, avoiding the possibility of serious health consequences.\r\n\r\nApps Features:\r\n1.

It was created to help patient with Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux, or chronic heartburn, is a long term condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications.¬†Acid reflux is the flow of stomach acid back into the esophagus. A common symptom is heartburn - a burning discomfort felt anywhere from the stomach up into the chest and throat.\r\n\r\nAbout GERD:\r\n\r\nRisk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatus hernia, and taking certain medicines. Medications involved include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and sleeping medication. It is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter (the junction between the stomach and the esophagus). Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.\r\n\r\nTreatment is typically via lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, losing weight, avoiding certain foods, and stopping smoking. Medications include antacid, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.\r\n\r\nYour lifestyle must be implement along with this type of diet, do exercise regularly, have good enough sleep every night (sleep early), quit smoking, eat more natural low in fat and sugar such as fruits, veggies, whole grains, non-fat dairy and fish.

        "description": "Acid Reflux Diet & Lifestyle Solution | Is there anyone who has not heard countless commercials to pop a pill to relieve acid reflux? Acid reflux is the flow of stomach acid back into the esophagus. A common symptom is heartburn - a burning discomfort felt anywhere from the stomach up into the chest and throat. Instead of pills, many health experts now recommend an acid reflux diet and other lifestyle solutions. In this app, learn what they are.\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs because acid reflux can become a serious, chronic condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. GERD can have several unpleasant symptoms that include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, dry sore throat, and coughing, as well as heartburn. Depending on their severity, these symptoms can significantly impair daily quality of life. Worse yet, GERD can lead to life-threatening conditions, including esophageal ulcers and cancer.\r\n\r\nSo why not just take the medications that neutralize stomach acid or restrict its production? The problem is, except for the most serious cases of GERD, these drugs are not meant for long-term or continual use. Over time, they can have negative side effects. Antacids can eventually upset the digestive tract and lead to diarrhea or constipation. Proton pump inhibitors like Prevacid and Prilosec, which are used to reduce the production of stomach acid, have been linked to increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease), pneumonia, and negative drug interactions.\r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, the many pills now available to treat acid reflux have done little to curtail its incidence. Approximately 40% of adult Americans now suffer from acid reflux. And shockingly, rates of esophageal cancer in the U.S. have increased 500% since the 1970s. Research, particularly a recent study from Denmark following more than 9, 800 GERD sufferers, has linked proton pump inhibitors with increase risk of esophageal cancer.\r\n\r\nThe first step in reducing GERD is often to limit foods that set off reflux. These ‚Äútrigger foods‚Äù differ from person to person but often include chocolate, coffee, fried foods, peppermint, spicy foods, and carbonated beverages.\r\n\r\nAvoid lying down for at least two hours after a meal or after drinking acidic beverages, like soda, or other caffeinated beverages.

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",
            "The UI experience is bad and not intuitive. I found it frustrating to use."

More names for acidity are hyperacidity or acid dyspepsia. Acid reflux or Acidity is one of the most normal diseases that cause heart burns in the upper body\r\n\r\nAcidity can be a result of inappropriate dietary regimen or stress. It is a problem which when left unattended to, results in peptic ulcer and other complications. It is quite a simple problem when it begins, but it can get out of hand easily if not taken critically. It means the excess secretion of acid by the gastric glands of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe usual signs of heartburn are a burning sensation or pain in the stomach after one to four hours of a meal.

The management related to acid reflux correlates to the foods we eat and the activities that we are involved in. It is very challenging to be compliant with any diet and to change our habits; however, many of us desire to review, from time to time, and comply when we realize the impact foods and activities have on our daily lives and sleep patterns. I hope that you find this review helpful.\r\n\r\nGastric Reflux\r\n\r\nMany patients with chronic lung disorders also have gastric reflux. Irritating acidic stomach juices leak out of the stomach and into the throat and esophagus, causing heartburn. The irritation results in muscle spasms in the throat. Common symptoms include frequent throat clearing, excessive mucous and soreness in the throat. Some patients have reflux with minimal symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe following are suggestions to assist in neutralizing the stomach acid, lessen the production of acid, and prevent acid from coming up into the esophagus. This information is not intended to be medical advice. Please consult with your doctor if you have specific questions regarding any of these suggestions.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\n\r\nNo exercise 2 hours before sleep.\r\nDo not bend from the waist to tie shoes.  Better to sit and extend legs, bending at the knees.\r\nBe aware of body position when doing chores, such as loading washing machine, bend from the knees rather than bending from the waist.\r\nNo downward dog yoga poses 2 hours before bed.\r\nClothing that fits tightly across the midsection should be avoided.\r\nStress can worsen reflux symptoms; practice relaxation strategies such as meditation, exercise or yoga.\r\nEvening:\r\n\r\nNo more than 10 oz. of fluids after 6pm. Avoid eating 2-3 hours before lying down.\r\nThis includes anything that can turn to liquid, such as ice cream or yogurt. The bacteria in the stomach can be aspirated to the lungs in a liquid consistency.\r\nHead of bed raised 30-45 degrees, hips to shoulder level by purchasing plastic bed lifts. You can find them for, approximately $10.00 and they are easy to assemble\r\nOr\r\nPlacing cinder blocks, wood or special cones under the bed. The desired elevation ranges from 4-11 inches, with 8 being the average.\r\nPile 2-3 pillows under head and shoulders. Place another pillow under the thighs so that the body is in a v position to prevent sliding to a flat position. Wedge pillows also help.\r\nSleeping on your back is the best, left side is second best, never on your stomach or right side.",

This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with symptoms such as a taste of acid in the back of the mouth or heartburn. Other symptoms may include trouble swallowing and chest pains. Complications may include iron deficiency anemia, volvulus, or bowel obstruction. The most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors include major trauma, scoliosis, and certain types of surgery.There are two main types: a sliding hernia, in which the body of the stomach moves up, and a paraesophageal hernia, in which an abdominal organ moves beside the esophagus. The diagnosis may be confirmed with endoscopy or medical imaging. Endoscopy is typically only required when concerning symptoms are present, symptoms are resistant to treatment, or the person is over 50 years of age.",

There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",

The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut.[3][4] The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.",

        "description": "Constipation is a disorder of the digestive tract. When you suffer from constipation your bowels don't regularly move or they are not emptied completely. Unfortunately constipation can cause many diseases because this disorder produces many toxins and these can reach in the blood stream and in this way they are carried in all your body.\r\n\r\nPeople of all ages can suffer from constipation taking into account that it is one of the most common digestive disorders. Most of the time this disorder is just temporary and it can be treated very easy. A great attention must be paid to the chronic constipation. It must be not neglected because it can lead to hemorrhoids, fecal impaction, piles, fecal incontinence, and anal fissures.\r\n\r\nFortunately this digestive disorder can be treated very easy. More on, there are lots of natural treatments that can help you to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n\r\nConstipation has many symptoms: from difficulty, infrequency or irregularity in elimination of hard fecal matter, foul breath, loss of appetite, coated tongue, dizziness, headache, dark circles under the eyes to dark circles under the eyes, depression, ulcer in mouth, varicose veins, acidity, insomnia, pain in the lumbar region, constant fullness in the abdomen and varicose veins.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nThe main causes of constipation are a fault style of life and a fault diet. Stress can be a cause, too.\r\n\r\nNatural Treatments\r\n\r\nMost of the fruits except jack fruit and banana are very useful in constipation treatments. Of course some are more effective than others. For example Bael fruit is considered the best natural laxative. But there are many other fruits that can help you to treat this digestive disorder as well.\r\n\r\nPears are very beneficial to treat constipation. If you eat a pear during your breakfast or after dinner, its effects will be surprising.\r\n\r\nGuava is another natural remedy. If you eat it with seeds, it provides your diet roughage. Eat one or two guavas every day and you will not suffer from constipation anymore.\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that they are very tasty, grapes are a merciless enemy of constipation.\r\n\r\nGrapes contain sugar, organic acid and cellulose and this combination make them to be a great natural laxative. Besides the fact that they clear the bowels they also tone up intestines and the stomach. Eat at least 350 gm of grapes daily.\r\n\r\nOranges can help you, too. Eat one or two oranges at dinner and at breakfast and the problem is resoled. Figs and papaya are very useful, too. You can also treat your constipation with spinach. Squeeze half of a lime in a glass of hot water and mix it with 5 gm of salt. You can also swallow a teaspoon of linseed with a glass of water before your meals. Drinking a glass of water in which you put a teaspoon of honey is another way to get rid of constipation. Drink teas made from herbal known as good laxatives. Drink horse gowan tea for example.\r\n\r\nAnyway a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will help you not to suffer from constipation.",

        "description": "Burning Issues On Heartburn\r\n\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôve just eaten a big meal and leaned back in your favorite chair to watch your favorite TV program. As you begin to relax, your chest starts to hurt so much it feels like it‚Äôs on fire. You may be experiencing heartburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to studies, about 30% of adults experience occasional heartburn, while 10% experience heartburn almost every single every day. Heartburn is common, and an occasional episode is generally nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, many people have already considered heartburn as a uncomfortable condition that requires medication or medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn usually follows after a heavy meal. To understand how this condition comes about, it is best to be aware of what exactly happens when we eat food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food that is swallowed travels from the mouth to the stomach through a hollow tube called the esophagus. Before food enters the stomach, it must pass through a tight muscle at the lower part of the esophagus called the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lower esophageal sphincter prevents food from traveling backward into the esophagus. Once in the stomach, stomach acid slowly digests the food. This acid is very strong and can damage most parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, the stomach is protected from its own acid by a special mucous layer. The esophagus, however, does not have any such special protection. If the lower esophageal sphincter does not close completely, the lower part of the esophagus can be damaged by stomach acid. When this happens, heartburn is experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn can last for several hours and is often worse after eating, or when lying down, or when a person who just ate suddenly bends over. Heartburn is the most common symptom of reflux. Reflux occurs when acid in the stomach, which is there to help digest food, rises up into the esophagus, causing pain, irritation, and discomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other factors that can make heartburn worse include certain foods such as fatty and spicy foods, chocolate, caffeine, onions, tomato sauce, carbonated beverages and mint. Alcohol, large meals, lying too soon after eating, cigarette smoking, sedatives, calcium channel blockers and antidepressant medications can also trigger heartburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn, also called acid indigestion, is the most common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); a disease in which stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back (refluxes) into the esophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn usually feels like a burning chest pain beginning behind the breastbone and moving upward to the neck and throat. Many people say it feels like food is coming back into the mouth leaving an acid or bitter taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost heartburn problems are mild, but if a person experiences frequent discomfort, there may already be some complications that need medical treatment or the use of prescription medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a person encounters heartburn several times a week, or if it returns soon after the effects of antacids wear off, medical attention may be necessary. A person with heartburn should also consult a doctor if he or she often wakes up at night due to discomfort brought about by reflux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne may need further medical care, or possibly even surgery, if a person experience difficulty swallowing, regurgitates blood or black material, suddenly loses weight, or if the stool is black in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people can manage the discomfort of heartburn with lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter medications. But if heartburn is severe, these remedies may offer only temporary or partial relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn pain can be mistaken for the pain associated with heart disease or a heart attack, but there are differences. Heartburn pain is less likely to be associated with physical activity. Exercise may aggravate pain resulting from heart disease, and rest may relieve the pain",

        "title": "Natural Remedies For Hiatal Hernia",
        "description": "Whenever an internal body part pushes through an opening and into an area where it does not belong, it is called a hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper portion of the stomach protrudes into the chest cavity through an opening of the diaphragm called the esophageal hiatus. Ordinarily this opening is only large enough to accommodate the esophagus. When it becomes weakened and enlarged, however, the opening can allow passage of part of the stomach. In some cases, that portion of the stomach may even become entrapped.\r\n\r\nWhat is a hiatal hernia?\r\n\r\nA hiatal hernia occurs when portions on the stomach creep through the esophagael hiatus.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of hiatal hernia:\r\n\r\nThe sliding type occurs when the junction between the esophagus and the stomach slides through the esophageal hiatus when there is increased pressure in the stomach. When the pressure is relieved, gravity causes the stomach to slide back into place.\r\n\r\nThe fixed type, or paraesophageal¬≠, occurs when the upper portion of the stomach becomes entrapped and thus does not slide back into position. This is less common than the sliding variety, and is more apt to be symptomatic.\r\n\r\nHiatal Hernia Symptoms\r\n\r\nThe most common hiatal hernia symptoms are heartburn and/or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It should be noted that many patients are diagnosed with GERD, but do not have a hernia, while others have a hiatal hernia but do not suffer with GERD. Chest pains can also be symptomatic of hiatal hernia. The pains can be severe, and may be mistaken for a heart attack. Obviously, if such pains occur, one should consult with a physician right away. Getting to a doctor is essential to getting proper care in time.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nWhile specific causes are not really known, hiatal hernias have been associated with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Pregnancy and delivery\r\n\r\n2. Weight gain\r\n\r\n3. Increased abdominal pressure from chronic coughing\r\n\r\n4. Straining during difficult bowel movements\r\n\r\nSome people are predisposed to hiatal hernia due to congenital weakness or enlargement in the esophageal hiatus. Obesity and smoking have also been proven to increase the likelihood of hiatal hernia.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nMost people do not have symptoms and no treatment is needed. If symptoms do occur, initial treatment may include medication to control acid reflux (GERD), and a change in diet. Weight loss is often recommended as a means of reducing the pressure on the hernia. If symptoms are chronic and do not respond to diet and medication, surgery may become necessary. If the hernia is in danger of becoming restricted or strangulated, surgery becomes the likely treatment. Today, most surgeons elect to perform laparoscopic surgery, because it is minimally invasive and recovery time is reduced.\r\n\r\nIf a patient who has been diagnosed with hiatal hernia becomes nauseous, experiences severe chest pains, is vomiting, or is unable to have a bowel movement, it should be treated as a medical emergency. Consult with a physician immediately.\r\n\r\nHiatal hernia symptoms are commonly misunderstood, if you feel you may have a hiatal hernia you should contact a doctor to resolve a treatment method quickly.",

Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes.

Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

            "Great overall! I'm working on eating more regularly and this app is what I'm using to transition away from fully logging every meal. Adding each item and seeing how many or what colors I'm lacking is fun and definitely inspires me to eat more and different plant based foods than I usually do (I struggle with purple, for example, so it's helped me try new ones in that category). I just wish various plant based milks (almond, coconut, etc) were listed, or that you could add your own food items.",
            "I've been using myfitnesspal to track nutrients, but ended up using it in a harmful way, focusing way more on calories than on quality of food. So I switched to this, and I love it so far, really helpful for creating a healthier mindset towards healthy foods and what they can provide. Thank you fue this!",
            "A little slow to get started, but smoother once you have a few 'favorites' logged. Fun way to get kids excited about trying new fruits and veggies. Great tool for adults, too!",
            "Really good app. It's a bit slow and clunky to add foods though. It would be lovely to see some features like being able to quickly add common foods, or see recent foods first in the search, or to multi-add foods. Edit: The update is amazing! The new feature is super handy! Thank you for considering my idea ü§©",

        "description": "A hiatal hernia is often known as a diaphragmatic hernia. Though most people are unaware that they suffer from one, it can be a serious problem if left untreated. Medically speaking, the hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes through the opening of the diaphragm (where stomach meets the esophagus).\r\n\r\nIf you are suffering from some type of reflux because of this disorder, it is now time to act and seek a natural treatment. My dad is a survivor of this problem and has been naturally cured over 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding hiatal hernias, and paraesophageal hiatal hernias.\r\n\r\nSliding hiatal hernias form when the stomach and the adjoining oesophagus slide up into the chest cavity through the diaphragm. It is more common.\r\n\r\nParaoesophgeal hernias are less common and it occurs when a portion of the stomach squeezes past the diaphragm and is lodged and strangulated in place beside the oesophagus. Such hernias can be asymptomatic but dangerous because the portion of stomach that is strangulated above the diaphragm will have a compromised blood supply.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, hiatal hernias are asymptomatic but sometimes patients might experience heartburn or reflux. While the two conditions appear to be linked, they do not independently cause the development of the other.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of heartburn, patients might experience chest pain instead and this can be confused with chest pain caused by cardiac issues.\r\n\r\nA hiatal hernia can be diagnosed with a specialized X-ray called a barium swallow that allows a doctor to see the esophagus or with endoscopy. The procedure involves the patient swallowing a radio-opaque liquid and having X-Rays of the chest and abdomen taken while in the erect posture. The radio-opaque liquid will outline the stomach lining and oesophagus, thereby demonstrating the presence/absence of the condition.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIf asymptomatic, no treatments are necessary. However, should the stomach become strangulated and there is a risk of vascular compromise to the stomach, surgery is usually needed to rectify the problem.\r\n\r\nOther associated symptoms such as reflux disease, heartburn and chest discomfort should be treated accordingly.",

            "The slider selectors are frustrating to use. The white circle handle is very small and clicking anywhere but exactly on the center of it makes the setting screen dissapear and forces you to restart the process over and over. The UI needs improvements - elements seem hard to select or to click on because are either too small or the activation area around them is reduced. Text can also be larger to be easier to read for eldery people. Otherwise, it's a promising app."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since.

            "I love the app, but I can't figure out how to sustain for more than 99 seconds. Maybe someone could take a breather and tell me. I'm sorry for not being more clear in my review. I'm trying to edit \"Tummo\" to do the \"Wim Hoff\" method. When I go to \"ratio of breath cycle\", it only goes up to 99 seconds. How do I make it go longer? I think it has something to do with \"seconds per ratio unit\" but I'm sort of confused. I was good at math in college, but that was over 50 years ago. Things are getting more discombobulated with age.",
            "All i needed to commit to a regular breathing practice is right here within this app. The wiki has been a very valuable resource to learn about breath work, how to practice, as well as the form and function of the app. I literally love this app and use it every day. It has certainly been one of the keys to help me create personal transform.",
            "I love this app and the paid version is so worth having. Breathwork is increasingly important in my self-care routine and I've just reincorporated this app into it, and I'm so glad I did. A little bit tricky to twiddle with if you're setting up custom breathing patterns but that's because you need to think about them mathematically, so not an issue with the app at all!",
            "Dear Oleksandr, there should be a way to hear the phase transition only once, instead of twice when it alternates between exhale and inhale. ie. I am inhaling for 5 seconds and 5 seconds exhale. I only want to hear phase transition once, after every 10 seconds, instead of every 5 seconds. there is no way to do this currently since exhale or inhale cannot be set to 0, but retain and sustain can be set to 0. When I am listening to this for hours in the background, less noise helps. Thanks.",
            "It is the best app out there. I have never written a recommendation before, but this app deserves it. I have trouble counting the seconds of my breathing while doing it and this app has sound effects so even with closed eyes you know when to inhale, hold, exhale. It has different techniques and I also customised to my way in the free version. It is really the best. Can't recommend it enough. Just download it!"

I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",

            "It disconnect and no notification displayed. As install and reinstall the app it works for few hours and again the same issue is created .. even if i am not using the band for 1 day or 2 days the charging is automatically reduced to end . And as you are saying the charging will be hold for 8 days. In actual case it is shut down in 2 days or maximum 3 days . Please try to fix these issues soon.",
            "Not even timer or music control facility is available in the band. I bought reflex Beat. At this price range, there are many fitness bands with many features. Can improve the watch by updating the software by adding atleast some basic features to meet the level of other bands. It all does is calculate the steps, record my heart beat ( which is great), sleep track and nothing else. Please add more features like Music control, Timer, stopwatch Vibration alarm can be bit long to wake up from sleep.",
            "One star because so many things going south. No update of software don't know why. The watch didn't have the same talked battery. Didn't show the notification fells like watch is moody. Only does one work that is showing time but with a take that is its have to be shaken or to be touched on sensor not the way it's represented \"just lift wrist to view\". I'm sorry but it is what it is.",
            "It's really worse, it disconnects and no notifications were displayed about the calls and messages and I am unable to reconnect, after delete and reinstalling the app it works for few minutes and then it disconnects. It's really bad experience. Try to solve this problem at the soonest.",
            "I'm giving it 4 star because this app is good but there are not so many features only the step counter ,heart beat rate camera functions there should be mp 3,call receiver and a camera in the watch because when we tap the camera the phone's camera is onn so plzz solve this problem because other watches had many features but I had but titan watches because its good and long lasting"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Great app. Doesn't need much introduction. Pricing is very competitive and is actually cheaper then gojek for the most part. Arrival time is quite accurate. When it comes to grab food however, its really expensive, and not worth the price. I would recommend supporting your local stores by taking away food or trying other food delivery options. Overall love the app. Its super easy to use. They just need to improve the pricing for grab food.",
            "I don't know what AI you're using for maps, but it is VERY unhelpful for me. Sometimes when I have no clue of where I am, the apps will give me \"suggestions\" so the clueless me simply clicked me cause I was foolishly following the \"suggestions.\" So yeah, I often have to run a lot. Another e.g. when I'm at one side, the location detected is on the OTHER side. I had to run and climb up the stairs all the way just to cross over. But I had no choice but to use it during emergency situations. Heh.",
            "Some of the distinations or places are not as accurate. Like earlier, the driver was waiting for me on the other building where I was on the other.. it would have been okay but I was carrying stuff and had to walk around the building since the map is showing im at another place. The driver even circled arouns and did not spot me to where i was. But, the idea of the service is pretty convenient.. has his flaws though.."

            "I tried putting in my weight, and while it shows \"kg\" as the measurement, when you look at the log, it shows \"lb\". Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",
            "This app is great. Tracks a ton of information I can share with my doctor. Quick.  Easy. Love the reports and notes features."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Steps doesn't work as a goal if you are doing your exercise in a gym or on a bike, and that's before we get to the fact that it is completely excluding many disabled people. Bring back move minutes as an option when setting your goals.",
            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.)

Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! üòÅüòÅ",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "The concept is great and I love that it shows vitamins and minerals too, not just the usual sugar/fat/protein, but adding foods is painfully tedious. For example, when you enter milk it doesn't give you normal milk on top, you have to scroll through all kinds of baby food containing milk first. Then it doesn't have any milk without added vitamin A and D, which is what I'd need. Then it asks you to give your serving size in grams rather than milliliters. Very awkward :/",
            "I downloaded this app to track my nutrient intake during pregnancy and I wasn't disappointed! I am so glad that they have an option to select for pregnant and lactating women instead of having to type everything in manually. It is easy to navigate and has a very clean look. It can be a pain to add in some of the foods that you cannot find, but I really don't mind doing such. Great app to track nutrients!",
            "A really good app to keep track of your nutrients. You can put in all you ate, with option to select measurement too, and it gives accurate info on the Vitamin, mineral, protein and carbs per day. Love it!",
            "The concept is great, but there aren't enough foods. I could add my own foods, but there are too many foods missing for it to be useful. For instance, greek yogurt isn't in the database. Annother annoyance - I filled out my foods earlier in the day and couldn't delete one after. I would give it 5 stars if it had a comprehensive database similar to myfitnesspal, and improved their user interface.",
            "Great app, I'd like to see more nutrients available to track, like omegas (6&3) and amino acids. Also, I am unsure why the totals don't add up to the daily values, and wonder if absorption is calculated and how. With that being said, this is the best app I have found for counting nutrients and Recommended Daily Values. Another thing I would like to see is a calculator for RDV to weight in grams or ounces, as that is how the app let's you put their value in your add a food to \"My Foods\" option."

Whenever my girlfriend sick (or myself) I just put in the symptoms and it gives me medicine that will help with every symptom I have. I'm no longer having to buy five different medicines at the same time. Not only that it gives me the location where this medicine might be my local pharmacy. And the prices so I can go get the cheapest one. It also has Amazon prices in case I want to buy a lot at once if I need to use the medicine frequently. And unlike WebMD or something like that it doesn't make me feel like I have some rare disease, it gives me something country I can work with that actually helps solve my problem instead of worrying about it. 10/10 would recommend.",

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from the acid ash hypothesis, which primarily related to osteoporosis research. Most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, who propose that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and other illnesses. Human blood is maintained between pH 7.35 and 7.45 by acid‚Äìbase homeostasis mechanisms. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkalosis and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious. The idea that these diets can materially affect blood pH for the purpose of treating a range of diseases is not supported by scientific research and makes incorrect assumptions about how alkaline diets function that are contrary to human physiology.\r\n\r\nWhile diets avoiding meat, poultry, cheese, and grains can be used in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH), difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of these diets have led to medications, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH.

            "In my opinion, this app is not worth the money for the Pro features. Only generic and limited information that one can find for free by doing a Google search on the topics. For example, the Pro feature Meal Planner is only one day's meals, unless you agree to buy another upgrade to the meal planner that costs about three times as much as you paid to unlock the Pro features. Paid to stop ads -app does not show menu to enter code - wasted that money too. More a store front than an app.",

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis ‚Äì the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer ‚Äì a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones ‚Äì small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis ‚Äì inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS ‚Äì a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ‚Äì long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning ‚Äì in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain ‚Äì painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems ‚Äì such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. \r\n2. Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "comments": [
            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I used the 200/300mb free trial version as a back up for several years in China. Finally decided to give it a shot and buying the premium. It worked for about 1.5 mo. Stopped working and never resumed. Customer support takes days to figure out anything. Sent me the wrong message about Kaspersky kid troubleshooting. Stear clear from this service, especially if you are in China.",
            "The VPN always turns itself off. I find myself always checking to see if it's on. So many times I've noticed that it's off and I get to play the \"how long has my data been un secured\" game. Definitely won't be renewing my subscription as this app isn't trustworthy. Such a shame, as I've been using Kaspersky for years.",
            "I've been using this app for a while with no problems on my S9 Plus, recently I updated to the Note 20 and it's not working on the Note 20 but still working on the S9 Plus. It says it has connected to said location but I still cannot access blocked content from the country I am in using my Note 20. Please fix this problem.",
            "If you are paying for only getting this service on Android phones, don't waste your money. It only works on Windows and Android app is useless as it always fail to connect. For a whole year of subscription , it worked for few days on Android no matter what the device I use. They would reply that service is blocked in country while it works well on Windows all the time. Inexperienced support on mobile platform indeed.",
            "Edit: already fix it, thank you.. First the app was working good and then (don't know when) the app fail to connect, try to restart my device but failed, then try reinstall but failed connect my subscription account, please fix it. Note: my another device just fine using it,"

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos üéÆüì±then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!üôÇüôè REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!‚ù£Ô∏èüôèüëçüëçüí´üëå‚ú®",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Honestly no idea why- but ive been experiencing so many problems with recent updates. Ive been working on this edit and all the transitions are extremely buggy- they won't even transition smoothly, it just cuts off. At first i didn't mind it because it wasn't too noticeable. But now its every single transition that won't come out smooth. Literally trying to do anything on this app either crashes the whole app or just messes up transitions.",
            "It had been working fine just the videos came out laggy all the time. Today i had spent an hour working on a video and the app just closed, everytime i went back in it would ask if i would like to continue editing and i clicked resume but then it would just close again. After a few times didnt even give the option to resume anymore and now i basically lost an hour of my life because of bugs.",
            "So I loved this app and I still do but there is one problem. I had this app signed into my old phone so when I got my new phone I tried so many times to log in but it keeps saying \"Account already registered\" So I have to be as a guest but I really wanna go on funimate as my account. Please help me log back into funimate.",
            "Honestly, super good! It's given me quite inspiration to do more things! The effects, filters are nice, and so is just everything in all. The reason I gave a star off, though, is because of the \"Locked\" items that can only be given through following FM on different platforms, but all in all a good software!",
            "My experience was just horrible I had to buy pro to get my edit which I spent hours on. If it would only come to that why wouldn't yall mention that in the beginning? I never got my edit and it took a lot of time to make. I'm upset. I'm never using this app again nor am I recommending it to anyone. Thank you have a good day. I hope this problem can be fixed."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app üíóüíóüíó However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet ü§óüíñ",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!!

            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play.

The great virtues of this plant have been recognized by many civilizations, including the Egyptians, Spanish, Persians, Greeks, Italians, Africans, Japanese, and Indians. It grows best in warm and dry climates and is densely found in India, Africa, and other arid zones.\r\n\r\nThe health benefits of aloe vera include strengthening the immune system, delaying the aging process, curing dermatitis, alleviating menstrual problems, reducing arthritis pain, and healing wounds. It also cures nausea, eliminates ulcers, lowers blood sugar and cholesterol levels, reduces oxidative stress, inhibits cancerous growth, heals the side effects of radiotherapy treatments, promotes hair growth, and soothes acid reflux symptoms. It has been used for ages to alleviate pain since it has excellent anti-inflammatory properties.\r\n\r\nAloe vera is a succulent plant with many amazing uses, and its benefits are typically obtained by breaking off a stalk to extract the gel-like substance within; it is then either applied topically to the skin and hair or ingested. The gel can also be combined with other natural ingredients to form part of your health or beauty routine. Aloe vera powder is also added to lotions, hair sprays, creams, baby oil, nutritional supplements, and pet care products.\r\n\r\nIf You like this app, it will be a huge support to give it a Positive review, rate it and share with loved ones for them to learn and benefit too.

        "description": "Batuk tidak bisa digolongkan sebagai penyakit. Batuk adalah  sebuah respon yang diberikan oleh sistem daya tahan tubuh di saluran pernapasan yang dikirim melewati syaraf  menuju pusat batuk di otak. Tujuan tubuh melakukan aktivitas batuk adalah untuk mengeluarkan sisa makanan yang masih tersisa di kerongkongan, berekasi terhadap asap, debu, lendir dan lain sebagainya yang berada di dalam bagian  reseptor (penerima rangsang) batuk seperti di saluran pernapasan, hidung dan telinga.\r\n\r\nDilihat dari jenisnya, batuk bisa dibedakan menjadi dua tipe, yaitu batuk berdahak dan juga batuk kering. Keduanya sama-sama menyiksa, namun batuk berdahak jauh lebih merepotkan disbanding batuk kering. Batuk berdahak akan mengganggu aktivitas, dan lender yang ada di dalam tenggotokan, tidak akan berhenti keluar sampai kita meludahkannya.\r\n\r\nSeringkali kita mengandalkan obat dari dokter atau apotek untuk menyembuhkan batuk berdahak. Padahal untuk menyembuhkannya, kita bisa membuat sendiri dari bahan-bahan tradisional yang mudah didapat di sekitar kita. Sebelum kita mengungkap lebih lanjut mengenai apa saja obat tradisional yang muncul, kita perlu belajar mengetahui penyebab batuk yang mengganggu aktivitas.\r\n\r\nApa saja yang menyebabkan batuk\r\n\r\nSecara umum penyebab batuk adalah bakteri dan virus. Daya tahan tubuh yang melemah, menjadi penyebab utamanya. Meskipun begitu, masih ada penyebab lainnya yang bisa jadi merupakan gejala penyakit lain yang kadang luput dari perhatian, sebagai berikut:\r\n\r\nPenyakit akut yang sering kambuh adalah jenis penyakit yang awalnya tidak terdeteksi namun menyebabkan anda sering batuk-batuk. Contohnya seperti PPOJ (Penyakit Paru Obstruktif Kronik), batuk disertai sesak nafas karena asma dan bronkitis parah.\r\n    \r\nAnda pernah mengalami batuk dan bersin di saat bersamaan ketika mencium bunga atau berada di padang bunga? Itu adalah Rinitis alergi. Alergi tersebut merupakan intoleransi saluran pernapasan pada serbuk sari atau serbuk bunga.\r\n\r\nPenyakit asam lambung akut atau istilah medisnya GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux). GERD adalah penyakit yang terjadi saat asam lambung menuju ke kerongkongan karena lemahnya katup penutup. Gejala dari penyakit tersebut adalah batuk disertai nyeri pada dada. GERD juga bisa menyebabkan batuk kronis.\r\n\r\nApakah anda pernah batuk-batuk terus di tengah jalan atau di samping orang yang sedang merokok? Itu tandanya anda sensitif dengan polusi atau asap. Polusi yang terhirup pasti akan menimbulkan reaksi di tubuh. Reaksi pertamanya setelah polusi terhirup adalah batuk-batuk keras.\r\n\r\nSuburnya pertumbuhan spora jamur di alam dan di lingkungan rumah juga merupakan salah satu faktor pemicu batuk dan  sesak napas. Aroma jamur spora yang cenderung lembab, tidak terlalu bagus untuk dihirup.\r\n\r\nAda juga batuk yang justru disebabkan setelah menelan obat. Salah satunya adalah sakit batuk setelah menelan obat ACE inhibitor. Obat tersebut adalah jenis obat yang dipakai untuk menurunkan angka hipertensi di dalam darah dan juga mengobati gagal jantung. Efek buruk dari penderita yang menelan ACE inhibitor akan sering menderita batuk kering. Batuk kering akan terjadi setelah pasien justru sudah sembuh sepenuhnya dari maag akut yang diderita.\r\n\r\nPartusis atau batuk rejan adalah batuk yang menandai adanya penyakit demam, flu dan juga batuk yang membuat penderita kesulitan dalam bernapas. Batuk rejan ini dapat diidap penderita hingga berminggu-minggu. Semakin lama kondisi vitalitas tubuh membaik,maka batuk rejan akan lama sembuhnya.\r\n\r\nSetelah memahami penyebab batuk pada anda,sekarang kita masuk ke pembahasan tentang obat alami yang bagus untuk menyembuhkan batuk berdahak.",

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.üò£ everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by thisüòê"

            "I used to love playing this game. Unfortunately they have changed it too much. I remember I could spend 10 coins and get 10 balls. Now its 35 coins for 5 balls. Now I only get 5 lives and if I run out of lives my options are of course to pay or to wait. I play this game to relax and can play it for hours. Now with the new heart/life system I can't. I'm very frustrated and disappointed. I'm on level 1445 but don't know if I'll keep playing I appreciate you responding to my review but until I see",
            "This game was fun. However over the past several updates they made it more and more about the money than the players. The game itself is fun. It used to be unlimited lives, but now it's to a heart system. This way you have to pay or wait to pay. The piggy bank is awful. It's just another way for them to make money. The fact that you used to get 5 balls free for watching an ad was fair. Now for 5 balls you pay 35 coins. All signs point to the developers only caring about money.",
            "Another piggy bank cash grab. I am going to uninstall because I refuse to pay for my own progress. If it wasn't a cash grab, why can't you make it to where I can open the piggy bank by watching ads, just like it gives me the option of watching a video for extra moves? Seriously, come up with an idea of your own and maybe it would be better. What a waste of time",
            "My mom and I, love this game so much but the new heart system is so frustrating. This is the only game that she plays over and over again. Please consider getting the old system back is kinda hard to explain to her why her game needs to wait for a while to play again cause she's getting old.",
            "Used to love this game, but the recent changes have made it more frustrating than it's worth. The constant ads, pop ups prompting purchases between each level, the constant piggy bank pop up were a little annoying but still manageable. The last introduction of hearts/lives has made it not worth the play at all. I understand the desire to monetize things, but it was taken too far. I normally buy the full version of the apps I like, but don't see an option for that with this one."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. ¬£43 per year or ¬£12 per PER MONTH or ¬£4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me ¬£5 per month and Netflix ¬£8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",

Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",

And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "So when I play the multiplayer game, the aponent's bar will run out and I will still have life but the game will continue on, until I end up losing!!??? Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one‚ù§Ô∏è!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",

            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server üò¢ i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!üëåüëçüòä",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",

I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forwardüò•",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "10.31 Not private so I would never pay them. APP is reading my browser searches. 10.3 Android 11. Cannot cancel large ads without closing screen or reloading app.. Fake reviews.8.12 Cuts out a lot. 8.9 I AM identifying the issues. 8.2 ONE more star off for running a tornado AD in the middle of a hurricane! This USED to be my go to streaming radio app. I like that you do not have to sign in. And why are virtually all of the recommended stations from 1 genre?",
            "Nice app. Tunes fast and clean. No interruptions so far. I like it. I feel I am going to upgrade it within the next 24 hours. After a month my favorite station breaks every 3 or 4 minutes. While I am writing this I uninstalled the app restarted my phone and I hope it's ok. See u later! I'm back after 17 minutes and is working just perfect.",
            "I have an old Samsung S3 which I am turning into an FM Tuner, since airwave FM reception where I live is a problem. I tried several apps including Tune-In which is a great example of a good product morphed into Major Bloatware. Another purportedly simple app is also bloated and impossible to navigate. Too much stuff which makes it impossible to so simple straight forward find a station, make it a favorite, and play it! This is what Simple Radio excels at. We software developers have a guide for good software: KISS Keep It Simple Sam. Excellent app. 10 stars. I got rid of the ads also. One question: is there a way to transfer a station list to another phone?",
            "Fantastic radio app! I spent 35 years as a pro radio broadcaster so trust me when I say this app is terrific and worth the small price of getting rid of the ads. While it has all my local stations it also has AM and FM and web stations from all over the world. Easy to use. Great sound. Easy to put you favorites on a page. Recommended!",
            "Works so much better than other radio apps! Like the title, it's a simple pain free radio! 10/26/20 update: I paid to remove ads, and I no longer have pop up ads from the app, but I've noticed a lot of the stations I listen to have a long stream of aired ads now. Idk if it's this app or the station itself, but 10 minutes of nonstop streamed ads are unacceptable."

It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to goüò≠! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.üòÄüòÄ"

Congratulations on a game that excludes so many devices. Maybe BMX 3 will be exclusive to just 1 specific device. Note: this is sarcasm and should not be interpreted as positive feedback.",
            "Awesome game, and no ads which is amazing. The only thing that will probably make the game a but less enjoyable is if you have a sensitive screen like me it can throw off all the tricks and landings. Other than that, there's also not many tricks. The last thing I don't like is that it sometimes doesn't count it when you complete a challenge but that might just be me. Other than that I love it so much and find it really fun üëç",
            "It is a good game but the game has all worlds money purchaseable. Wish it could have a free world. And some people who complain about the 10 jumps, read this before you say there aren't, go slow for the first 2 jumps, land on the center then fall off, then after that you can play the game normally.",
            "5 stars this game is awesome and not an absolute waste of time. Just two problems. You have to buy the different levels with real money and it sucks cos i have almost completed the first level. Also there isnt 10 jumps in the first level so you cant do the challenge. But i would recommend this game to you.",
            "All tought the controls are way better than touch grind skate, This game needs a free play mode were you can mess around. I dont want the game to end when I'm playing. I don't know why the controls in this game are so good but on touchgrind skate the controls are üóë"

A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"üôàüôâüôä"

            "Worst game ever. Lost VIP status because I refused to pool any more money into this rip off game. They have also jacked up their prices for their money packages. Buyer beware. In fact, find another time filler because you won't fill time on here. You'll just be very unsatisfied with the game. Boycott.",
            "You make me watch the apps for commercials ads then you turn around and you don't produce the bonus money where is the fairness in that but yet you want somebody to spend money to buy when if you don't watch the ads you don't get anything one you're not enjoying the game because you have to keep watching that playing ads just to play the game to enjoy",
            "What has happened to my bonus awards I have not used them but they have all disappeared for this season. I have been having good wins and save my awards to have a good start to the next season. Please give them back as I love the game and enjoy playing. It would be great if this was fixed asap.",
            "hi lightning link. love the game I play daily. I do have one problem if u can help me. I had a 20million reward saved up, I updated the app to the new Halloween version and when i went back in it says that i collected it but i never got the coins for it. any help is appreciated thank you"

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! üòä",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "I've been using this since my Oppo A37 (very old model) until now with my Oppo Reno 4. And this works very great on both! It stops my battery draining very fast like normally it decreases every minute but ever since I am using this app, my battery life can continue for another 2 hours. I can't live without this. Please don't try to update this like there were so many changes, I like it to be this simple already. Thank you!!!!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews but I felt that I should with this one. I have a Galaxy s8 plus. It's an awesome phone except for the battery, especially after the last update. I took a chance and downloaded Greenify and noticed a difference the first day. My battery definitely lasts MUCH longer and the bonus is there's no ANNOYING ADS! Seems to be a great app so far.",
            "This app called greenfy.apk, please this app helps with hybernating and closing all background apps running at your background and draining your battery live span. It works perfectly on both rooted and non-rooted devices. It will show you all the system and non system apps running currently and the time you started running those up and stiil counting!!! Then you can either choose to hybernate it or let it run so, I think this app is perfect for those using iPhone and we the Android lover",
            "I've always used this app, no matter what device I use. Now I'm using RealMe 5 Pro (not rooted), and I decided to finally purchase the donate version, and it somehow doesn't work :/ when it force closes an app, the next app's 'Force Close' option is grayed out, so in the end, I have to force close each one individually. I really love this app, and I'm hoping for a fix soon.",
            "I have been using Greenify for years now and it has saved me so many times when I am out and about by saving battery for me. One thing to note is that it is not for those who don't know what they are doing. With that said, Greenify should include more instructions and short explanations(such as the meaning of backgroud-free). A lot of bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works and don't know it's limitations."

            "Used AVG protection for years and always been happy with it. Used on Windows OS before and now on Android. I like the new additions to AVG protection that are useful when using Andriod nowadays instead of Windows e.g. Ram Boost because it is easy to end up with lots of programs running in the background no longer needed but still open and using up RAM.",
            "I ordered the yearly subscription Ultimate edition and WONT show up in subscriptions when I log into website so it won't allow antitheft to be setup. VPN also won't allow itself to work. How am I supposed to know if anything else is working on here. I reached out to support and nothing. This is a waste of money. If I could give a lower score I would. Let's ee if I get help now",
            "Paid for subscription that renewed in June but when I open the app it stills says I need to upgrade to pro. Try to link it says no subscriptions found and yes I made sure it was the right Google play account. Stupid when my Google play specifically says I have a subscription but AVG protection app doesn't even acknowledge it. Waste of money, canceled the subscription.",
            "I don't usually install apps from other sites than Play Market, thus my chances to face viruses and prove if the app is reliable have not been high to this moment. Though, I used the PC version of AVG and it prevented some attacks. So, I think, it is effective. Still, there is an actual inconvenience: \"Web Shield\" stops working from time to time and user has to renew its permission to work in the settings of the mobile phone (Sony Xperia). P.S.: Thank you, I followed your advice.",
            "Generally happy with the app, but not happy with adverts popping up, when I am trying to select apps to hibernate. Some of these ads, spring up, with no obvious way of cancelling them, and can easily be activated, by accident. I am a pensioner, using the free version, as I cannot afford the de-luxe version"

Fix the name of the song, fix the high pitch notes , and fix the speed. Other than this , still an awful app. You only get 10 coins? Maybe 20 if you get 2 crowns or something. I have to pay 100? I like some songs but thats too much of a time waster, awful app , do not install",

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",

EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",

        "description": "Appendicitis is caused by inflammation of the vermiform appendix and usually causes pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant, referred rebound tenderness, overlying muscle spasm and cutaneous hyperesthesia. This disease is common and occurs with an annual incidence of 0.25 percent in the normal population, and there is a lifetime risk for acute appendicitis of 7-9 percent.\r\n\r\nSince appendicitis is something that some never get, or only get once, the appendicitis symptoms are often mysterious or unknown. This guide answers the questions most people have and tells you some common symptoms, information, and theories on the subject. Since appendicitis can be deadly and often afflicts young adults (but can be any age), this guide is designed to help people understand appendicitis so you can make proper decisions and hopefully get it treated quickly and properly.\r\n\r\nA possible diagnosis of appendicitis symptoms is a frightening and daunting prospect for parents and patients. Whether the patient is you or a loved one, there are many questions and concerns about the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.\r\n\r\nDesigned for the layperson, this easy-to-understand guide supplies reliable answers and essential information that well-informed patients need to know.\r\n\r\nReading this easy-to-understand guide empowers you with knowledge. You will understand appendicitis symptoms and the treatment of the disease and what you can expect in a hospital. You will also be able to confidently discuss the signs, symptoms, and diagnosis of appendicitis with your family, nurses, and doctors.\r\n\r\nIn this application you will find:\r\n‚Ä¢\tWhat Is Appendicitis? \r\n‚Ä¢\tWhat Causes Appendicitis?\r\n‚Ä¢\tAppendicitis Diagnosis\r\n‚Ä¢\tHome Remedies \r\n‚Ä¢\tWarning Signs \r\n‚Ä¢\tUnderstanding Appendicitis\r\n‚Ä¢\tMuch much more!\r\n\r\nDownload this app now!\r\n\r\nNOTE.
