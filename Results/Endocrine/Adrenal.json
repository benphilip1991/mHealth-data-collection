Actually the biggest business in my town (Carbon Hill, Al)is Jack's Family Restaurant and yet they r not on ANY OF THESE CARDS THAT I PURCHASED?? Participation from more business make these discount cards sell better so maybe we can get more added soon?",

To mess up the most basic, fundamental standard is unacceptable. After reading the other reviews it appears to not get any better once the account is activated. I will donate the money directly to the school next time instead of having a blood sucking company make money off sports teams.",

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

            "This is a good game but I have given it only one star because it has 1 ad. after a match and at times when the match begins. Multiple time the app suddenly stops working. I first thought that it can be due to my device's ram, which is 2GB but later I found out a friends device which has this same game and ram as 6GB, while he is also facing the same issue. Please fix this.....",
            "I like the game, it has good graphics.but the things u should work on is the controls, because it is weak,when hitting your opponent the wrestler already smack u down.and another thing is there should be a commentator, during the fight.it's a good game in gameplay, but need to be upgraded.and the wrestler's are not real, no real names,no undertaker,or Justina..so poor.☹️☹️",
            "This game is rigged, everything is working against you. I'm giving it a second star because I'm actually enjoying the game. The stats of the characters are actually useless, because someone you're more than by far can just do as he pleases with you and your moves. It would have been a very wonderful game if you didn't make it very unfair to the players. How can a ref count slowly for you and count fast for your opponent in a game? It's a rigged game, not challenging at all, just rigged.",
            "The best wrestling game on the market, and as a fellow game developer extremely well done for what it is, the actual controls have a bit of a learning curve but its amazing once you get them down. I had to buy the full game. Super excited for the new one boss. :) if you need a tester i would be honored.",
            "It was a nice and wonderful game, good graphics, almost real characters and credible moves but I rate this 4 stars because I think it wasn't totally perfect. May I suggest that you can set those attack here as a finisher or mid-air counter like superkick or bicycle kick. I think there's also a mistake in this game. How a gaunt wrestlers lift up a chubby and 7 ft tall opponent? Then if your opponent kick up to your pin, you can't get up emmidiately instead your opponent get up first than you."

            "I enjoyed this game but it now very frustrating because it is so hard to win any games. Like ridiculously hard. It never used to be like this. Truly sad as I've put a lot of time and money into this game, it shouldn't be the only way you win is to spend money on power ups.",
            "Great game, beautiful graphics and themes. Fun to play, requires strategy- as you advanced and level up-, it becomes harder- but I love that there's also extra rewards and power up earned as you advanced.",
            "Like the game . But? I know on Android I can not even make a log in for jam city . The app will not open my keyboard so I can type it in my email. Ugh the pain . Please fix on pixel 2 xl running android 11",
            "I like that you can use any unlocked character in the journey levels and switch at any time. However, the events in the game usually do not hold my interest. I would like to see more Hans-related things, such as his alternate outfits for playable characters and his statue for a collectible to go with the other main characters."

If you do not pay them $$$ tgen you will mysteriously wreck. I was in first and all of a sudden I wrecked. I was going straight and not even near a barrier! Come on devs??? How can you be so $$$ hungry??? Until these things are resolved you will not ever get a 5 star review from me.",
            "The game is great. But the payment is too small. The cars are too expensive. Upgrading a car is a big problem. Tokens are nearly impossible to get.. I have been playing this game for 3 years and i have only 1 car bought with token, 3 years!!! It's frustrating... It's high time you work on this game and give us a new upgrade..",
            "I would give it a 4 star beacause mostly the gameplay is cool and the fact that you can bump into stuff. The graphics are amazing and you can change the angle of the camera. But because is a lot of the cars cost money and theres not that much cars that dont actually cost real money. At leats make a couple of cars that dont cost money ( not saying its a pay to win game )",
            "Great game. Thanks to the the team who created such an amazing game. Awesome graphics, nice cars, everything on the game are so pretty. But it is so tough to buy a car with tokens. Cause after finishing a chapter or level there is no tokens are given. Please, work on it.",
            "I'm sorry but I last played in 2017. I used to like this game very much and so had progressed a lot. But after 3 years, when I'm again logging in it is starting from the beginning!?! I'd used Play Games account back then and it's still showing me 48/70 achievements. But when I'm logging in the game, it is not syncing and forces me to play from the very beginning!

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",

Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence.

            "It is a very nice game. I am playing this game from a very long time , around 4 to 5 years , but now you have to pay for some customisation and for some fast cars which can only be bought through diamond . Please add more places other than city,airport ,port and off-road. There are two more modes, police chasing and another which always show coming soon . I've been waiting for those two new modes , please launch the other two modes soon.",
            "Brilliant game, love how easy it is to get cash. Just one thing though, everytime I try and resume theres an ad, could you make it like every 4 times you click resume or something. Also, some of the time trials and drift challenges are impossible to do in a normal car, like the 20,000 cash on on offroad with 31 checkpoints and 3 laps, you cant do that in 4 minutes, it's impossible without an offroad car which cost way too much. The 5,000 and 10,000 druft challenged on port are impossible too.",
            "It's been so long since I played this game and I'm so happy with how this game improved! I think I first played this game around 2015 maybe and I enjoyed it! Five years later and the graphics have improved and the game quality improved too. However, I don't like that there is now limited customization with the vehicles--nitro is one example--but I think I can pass on that. Another thing I hope to see in the future is more areas besides the airport, off-road, and the port.",
            "I have been playing this game for a very very long time now. During this time I have absolutely loved playing this game. However some minor issues ruin the best experience possible. Such as : at high speed my car will start bouncing on the road and ruin my speed records. I would really want this fixed. A cool feature would be a turbo sound ! In feed in the game the turbo only increases the speed of the car. However the sound of a turbo is always great to hear. Please add one.",
            "Actually a fairly decent game, few flaws though. The drifting challenges are very hard since they want you to learn how to drift while in a straight away..... still a really good game despite the few flaws it has. Also turn off wifi and data so you dont get ads, but the ads arent too bad if you want to keep it on. The driving does take some getting used to."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

My issue is that eveything is all about money now, you gotta pay to advance. It wasn't the case before. There were some in game purchases before but nothing like it is now. What made it enjoyable, and what makes me want to always play, is that I may not purchase everything to get ahead. I just wish it was like it was before...",
            "I love the graphics and all the different modes that there are...really good game...tho I would put the multipling earnings with ads...that can give users the option of doubling the credits or the same amount of fusion coins... example: you got 1000 credits on a race...you get the option of multipling them, so you get 10,000(1,000x)...soo that we also have the option of instead of only double earning credits... Also fusion coins...buy we get the same amount we would get if it was normal credits.",
            "Very disappointed! I thought the latest update was the best update since they have included the high frame rate settings on my ASUS Max Pro M2. The game was very smooth at 60fps and I didn't encounter problems or glitches. But after I opened the game again the settings for high frame rate was gone. The cost of upgrades is already so expensive, at least give us a chance to enjoy the game @ 60fps.",
            "I don't think making a comment is going to change anything, but I will go ahead and vent a bit. This game is fun, but super expensive. Like, all the cars in S class cost tokens all of a sudden. What happened to plain old credits? Sure, the prices were exorbitant, but there was some silver of hope. With these ridiculous token prices, how are those of us who cannot/do not pay to play make any progress? And how does one even go about earning a decent amount of tokens? Honestly.",
            "Latest update reduces value of original currency to ZERO. You spend all this time earning it, now it's worth NOTHING. It has been replaced with a currency introduced a few updates ago. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! The game is decent. It's just Gameloft that SUCKS!!!! If Gameloft makes the game, find a different one. It will be better in the end!!"

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "Dev's team there is a bug: the interface and all the gameplay is so fast that it just not playable anymore. Bugs: 1.Interface is more responsive, simple touch opens up 2-3 options. 2. Not able to play any track, the overall gameplay speed of bike is increased to 10times as of normal gameplay speed. 3. Unable to connect to server error when opening showdown section. Looking forward for the fix soon.",
            "Game's really fun , like the physics of the game , how every bike felt unique in terms how it feels , but i do have a complaint about a bug I am encountering at the moment where my game sort of crashes every time i opened up the map...i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game and logged back in to my account but it still keeps happening...would like to have you try and fix this issue for me , it would be really helpful. Otherwise good game , keep up the good work devs",
            "Played Trials since the 1st one, big fan! :) This one, like all the other Trials games, gets quite hard after a while..But still fun & addicting. Been playing this version for about a year. Theres always more to do/unlock. One downside, there hasnt been any of the different big holiday events for the last several holidays. I was hoping thered be a halloween event this month like last halloween. So sadly the games hayday might be over? Hope devs dont quit this one yet, still has a ton of players.",
            "Love this game but i come out of the bike shop and it says downloading latest content and that's it. Doesnt download. I'm connected to the internet and everything is fine in my end. The game just wont download. It really angers me because I love playing this game. I had it about a year ago and it was great. I re downloaded it and could only do 5 missions and then it says its downloading latest content but doesnt, and I cant play while it's doing that. I can't play the game at all now.",
            "Amazing graphics and ATD. I love everything about the game. And you never get too good of bikes to just breeze through the game. My only problem is that terracotta is made to make you better. As well as make you use timesavers. When you race him at the mill, he uses the only timesaver there. Making it extremely hard."

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

Maybe it doesn't happen to other people, but it does to me, maybe it's a glitch or something. But other than that- it's so cool! I'm rating it 5 stars for sure. My teacher in the morning, she opens the app and shows it to the students. We travel many cool places! So I searched for this and now I'm truly addicted. Best earth 🌎 globe ever!",
            "The app is easy to use , the map is accurate too but my complaint only is the maps and street view is very old . The street that i always passing through as of now there's a gasoline station there but in the map of google and street view the location is still in grassy area. It seams that this map is from 2015 or less i guess. Please update the map because everything is changing and needs an update of it thanks.",
            "Very out dated, My apartments have been here for almost 3 years and its still showing as woodlands when I put in my home location. I've noticed it on a lot of other things too buildings that are no longer there new buildings that have replaced them it is completely outdated and if Google maps has updated all these things I don't understand why why Google Earth has not updated these things. Other than that the graphics are great so my only complaint would be YOU NEED TO UPDATE!",
            "I love your app google and it would be good if you could update your images but I don't think you have to like all the other reviews say. I understand if you can't because you will have to code sooooo much again just to update the pics. I understand as I am myself a coder. Thank you so much google 💓.",
            "Good app..Just my location is so outdated...it shows what my area in West Kentucky looked like 9, I said 9 YEARS old..as much money and tech that google has, seems they would update the \"Flagship\" of satellite apps.. And as far as the graphics that everyone is bosting over..they look like a 7 yr old used water colors..Sorry google,...but have to be honest..Doubt you will respond to this just like you don't respond to any comments..My location is West Kentucky....Please Update.

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Amazing! Going off road feels good. Graphics are good. I did not knew that there are so much category in cars. This was something different from other car racing games. I would like to have much more cars and maps in this game. Gameloft did a great job. Why don't the game developers add a long range racing? I would like that. Driving from country to country.",
            "I have played every one of their games this is by far the best. But you need a top of the line phone or computer to play it on. It'll make you sweat after a race even if you're an air conditioning of all the asphalt games this is by far the best. Asphalt 8 is nice because you can play it offline. I'm not sure if they have any other offline games. I played a lot of racing games in 20 years in this one's top of the line.",
            "This game is like a strange and wonderful dream. It's pretty indescribable so you're going to just have to check it out. The graphics are just terrific. One of the main reasons I downloaded this game is it says multi-player head to head competition and it won't even let me do that because it says I don't have a good enough Wi-Fi connection and I don't even mind that much because the game is pretty cool even without that. I'm going to want to do it eventually but I'm OK with it for now.",
            "I love really love this game, the gameplay is nice and the graphics are mature, so many exciting events, game levels and game modes to play, so there is never a dull moment, its almost as good as asphalt 8, once again gameloft has made a very fun and exciting video game, gameloft hardly disappoints, the only things i don't like about the game is that the cards are too expensive to earn and the Wifi is a must for multiplayer events, every other aspects is good",
            "Great addictive gameplay. Got half way through this time before I realized I wasn't going to be able to upgrade cars enough to continue. The help section says cards are given on a lottery basis, maybe developers should alter the algorithm to give cards based on need so players can actually continue playing. Or just be honest \"Free to play. Must pay to complete\". I've thought about buying bundles but I'm not willing to take the risk of not getting the rewards I need."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",

I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download.

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

I've since reinstalled it. It restarts at level one every install, every device. You have to pay to go ads free every install, every device. This includes the reinstall on my phone.",
            "What Happened???? I used to play this game for hours. I've had it for at least 2 years. During that time I had to submit to the new download they had but then in the last 2 weeks something has happened. I can no longer keep playing endlessly. I am now being told after completing a level that there will be no next level for the next two weeks. Whaaaaat????? Every now and then I get the challenge levels but c'mon. I don't normally write reviews but..... I'm about to uninstall this game.",
            "I recently reinstalled 'cookie-rush' so I could start again from level 1 as there are no plans from the developers for any future update. Which is a total shame as I absolutely adore playing the highly challenging but fun app-levels. So kudos to ilyon for developing the original and best masterpiece game that ever was.",
            "This game is interesting ,so nice, when i first saw this game, i saw like it was so boring but i said let me download just to finish the MBs and i downloaded it but i Saw like it was just for the kids to play it but the moment i opened the game and started playing i was just alone, ow, i haven't found a game like this and i would encourage more people to enjoy this game just like me. thanks.",

            "This game is so-so. What I liked: -The moves, customizing the character's appearance, the special effects we can use when skating, and voting on other people's dances. What I didn't like: -The game forgot what items I already unlocked -Doesn't keep my previous selections as the defaults. -Some types of items aren't removable. Example: it forces me to wear a ring or a bracelet if I had already put one on because I can't remove it unless I replace it with another one. -Crashes too often. -Intrusive ads. -Voting system poorly explained. -Washing hair was tedious and not fun. -The gym game doesn't fit the workout theme and isn't fun.",
            "Nice game! But alittle dissopointed that things are locked. My Mom and dad don't have a problem buying me games, but this game costs too much and it 's TOO cool to write about. So maybe I thought you can make the game $5.99 or $2.99 so I can buy it. Please and thank you. Hope you read this. And I wanted to say I. LOVE. COCO! And that's why I want to buy this game. PLEASE! I will fix my review when my dream becomes true. Thanks!",
            "I should give u 5 Stars because this game is incredible. I never got this type of game.👏 For Coco games I can rate 4 Stars, because in Coco games there are some problems like ads and I should purchase some things. But In these all ads are only the main problem. And when I'll purchase it says something went wrong. So I just adjusted with what are remaining😅. But coming to this game it's awesome and interesting.in this dresses are cool, awesome😍.But jewellery is less😔.But still I💖 this game",
            "Why means 90 persent of stuffs are locked and we cannot play without some stuffs so you should unlock all the stuffs and i will give you somesuch stars and for coco games i can give 4⭐ and what the dresses they are awesome and makeups also but in makeup i want some changes but awesome 👌🆒️. And i want to say one thing that is you have to make this game awesome and you can make. But jewellary are less i want that to improve. And all the best👍.and i like this game very much.",
            "Nice game you can even watch ads to unlock single moves and couple ice skating moves but the pink part i can't unlock anything. The last part i can't unlock it and those moves look so sickly awesome. To do but too bad i can't unlock them other than that it's cool there are cute dress,top,skirts and you can watch ads to unlock the different ice skates some people maybe thing my god there are too much ads popping up but i like it because you can unlock different moves. 😁😀"

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "I like this game, but a few things I don't get! 1) I have the most points in the Regulation races and am still lying between 9th & 11th in the overall table. 2) When you watch an advert to gain Gold coins, where does the coins go? There is no indication! 3) Why does mine and every other player show there wins as 0 wins, as I have won at least 8 regulation races and about 3 Ladder races! 4) The hot lap, says to race against clock, the clock doesn't start? SORT THESE PROBLEMS OUT!",
            "Overall good game that doesn't require a \"pay to win\" strategy. Great customization tweaks for performance.. Would like to see qualifying rounds for starting position. The endurance races are a little ridiculous, 400 laps can take 3 hours and you've lapped 2nd place 5 times by lap 20. Also AI doesn't seem able to pit and repair cars so in longer races your racing against nothing but slow flaming balls of fire after 10 laps. But issues aside still haven't found a more fun racing game.",
            "I like this game but I wish if the other drivers were smarter instead of just crashing into each other, also I wish if the drivers would stop in the pits because it would just feel more realistic and it's weird watching yourself passing a car half destroyed and on fire. They should add more features like that and make it more realistic. Over all I like it though",
            "Preety good stock car racing game. The controls are better than nascar heat. But what I dont like about this game is that there are no cautions. Also I would like to see more tracks that Nascar currently runs on. Lastly I would give this game a rating of 5 stars if they improved the performace of AI and add a option to add friends.",
            "This is a great game. I would give it 5 stars IF the starting lap was fixed. The cars that arenin the top 3 pos at the start are already about to lap you (i have one of the fastest cars and its still incredibly hard to get back up top). I would love a mechanic to do an actual starter lap instead of using luck to hope the top cars crash"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

Great job to the devs you really capture that feeling and put it into a mobile app bravo. To make this game even better I would make the bikes customisable like paint jobs and bike mods. Maybe open a multiplayer race mode, that would be top notch. Great job devs",
            "It could be the best game of its genre but the rewards are lame. Getting cash to buy the right bike can take way too long which put me off. I would spend real money but everything is too expensive. Give me a good deal and im happy to pay but over price everything and i aint spending a penny. Real shame coz the physics, dynamics, graphics, all of that, is top notch.",
            "It was good the few first levels, but after a while, it gets really hard to get new bikes because they are really expensive, and it takes a long time to earn the cash. I literally bout a really nice bike, and after 2-3 missions, it said I needed a new one. I JUST BOUGHT IT! You literally need to grind for two hours to earn the cash for a nice bike that will last you more than 3 missions. the game was good at first. But now the fun is gone.",
            "It's an excellent game. Good graphics and very exciting. What I dislike in the game is the fact that some levels are just too difficult and nearly impossible to get the gold. You don't expect the bike to have a near miss when you line up 4 vehicles horizontally with little or no space to manauvre and also brake the speed immediately to allow movement. It's as if the game is programmed to dent good records at some certain levels. Overall it is good game.",
            "Smooth easy to control with great sense of speed still the best traffic game on mobile, I have been proud to buy with real money to support this game, hope they don't forget this and still keep up the updates, my wish list is small gentle corners maybe working traffic lights on cross junctions hence dodging side flowing traffic and more area's maybe since a Turkish developer add the pine Mountain forest roads two way one lane roads of south Turkey especially on a dawn morning just a thought."

This hormone, which is produced primarily in the testicles, is associated with sexual prowess, libido, and muscle strength, but it also is critical for maintaining bone density, energy levels, and even moods. In many ways, it is the male hormone.\r\n\r\nThat’s why when testosterone levels begin to decline as men age and because of other factors such as weight gain, exposure to environmental toxins, and sedentary lifestyle, guys begin to worry. They see their sex drive faltering, their waistlines expanding, their hairlines receding, their sleep habits changing, and their get-up-and-go waning. Suddenly all those late-night ads on TV about testosterone replacement and supplements to boost T levels sound like the answer. But they are not.\r\n\r\nTestosterone levels are going to decline as you age – especially if you are sedentary and/or overweight, and/or you don’t get enough sleep – but that doesn’t mean you can’t take steps to significantly improve your T levels naturally and keep them at a point that allows you to maintain your effectively. \r\n\r\nTo produce testosterone, your body requires several different nutrients. Among the nutrients more often depleted are vitamin D3 and zinc. Zinc is an essential mineral that is naturally present in some foods. Deficiencies can result in a wide range of symptoms because zinc is involved in a number of significant body processes.\r\n\r\nVitamin D can be manufactured by your body when your skin is exposed to the sun. However, many people are deficient in vitamin D because of the number of hours spent indoors and the amount of sunscreen used. I don't advocate hours of unprotected sun exposure, but your body does require regular unprotected exposure to produce vitamin D and gain other benefits.\r\n\r\nStress is a natural testosterone killer. When your body experiences stress you release cortisol, a hormone secreted by your adrenal glands. Cortisol reduces the effects of testosterone on your body. If you want to improve the effects of testosterone, then reduce your stress and cortisol levels.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, is to include certain foods in your diet on a regular basis.

            "While this game can be quite fun at times with the various characters, attractions, and events, the fact that it is basically a neverending money-sucker really takes away from the fun. Most of the Disney characters need to be bought with real money, usually at $10 each go. Then you get a chance of getting some characters, but it isn't guaranteed. I've honestly dumped about $50 into this game and IT IS NOT WORTH IT. It's like a digital pyramid scheme.",

They continue to make events impossible for players who aren't willing to spend their entire paycheck. With each new terrible update, I wonder why I'm still playing. If the next update doesn't remedy the many problems they've introduced, it'll be time to delete. It used to be fun, but man have they taken the joy out of it recently.",
            "My last issue was fixed but now I can't stand how you can now only use 75 characters at a time.... I don't want to keep my characters locked up and like to use them all... with this new update it is even harder to get what is needed to level up characters and with having so many characters forced to be locked up you can't get as much magic! Let me use all my characters already!!!!!!!",
            "could be great. Sounds like it was. Everything takes a ton of time to do, and its a pain collecting for characters. Game only seems possible if you drop a lot of money and a lot of time. For example, Prince Charming. to unlock him took me a bit because I was missing a set of gloves, but finally got him. Did one quest, then I had to level him up which took a while again. Did one quest, and now I have to do all that over and level him up yet again. All about spending real money.",
            "So I love playing this game. But the new update that limits the number of characters allowed out in the park at one time is stupid. I absolutely hate it. Please change it back to letting unlimited number of characters in the park. Also increase magic rewards and more chances for character scrolls would be nice. Park expansion seems a bit high for some parts as well. And bring Ratatouille To the game!!!!"

Hospital, photo booth and spa is locked. My suggestion will be to not download the game. Coco play games are good but if they will unlock every thing and make new games then it will be good. I have uninstalled it. If you already downloaded then delete it.",
            "Nice games but so many locked dresses ,makeup , hairstyles , hair colour ,etc . it's ok we can unlock by watching adds but what about the dance moves ,spa and hospital we have to buy only . That's why I had given only 3 stars . My request is there that unlock some dance moves and keep some to buy at least keep 3-4 moves . About spa and hospital you keep two options 1. To buy and get it . 2. Keep 20 or 15 ads to watch and then unlock . It's better if you keep like this way .",
            "This game is really fun and all but at my FIRST performance I kept hearing somebody whisper something like \"press that\" but it was creepy. I also hate that you have to unlock a load of stuff",
            "I hope you add more clothes, shoes, hairstyles, nail arts, accessories, stage designs and music if this isn't for free so we could at least enjoy more even not having full version. Make it worth the pay if possible to those who purchased it too. IF NOT, we can watch ads to unlock everything and get access to it (while you still earning back from it.) I love to play the full version but paying for full version when it's still lacking, its not worthwhile. Thank you.",

And make up💋and hair salon💇 and restaurant 🍔🥗🍹🍰☕and gym and it also includes clinic 💉💊🩺 and photo booth and spa but they are locked. After ready ballerina we have to go to competition .

Even if it does it should've been mentioned on google play just like many other games.",
            "It is an enjoyable game nice graphics and physics.my only thing would be to make the dpad floating and so can uused by either hand as I have no use of my left it would make it. Easier if all controls could be used by the right.",
            "Love the game so far,it better then alot of the game out there, but having so difficulties with the store right now it not letting me use my gold or gems. Hopefully it will be big free soon.",

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

Jesus I just want to play chess! No, none of the ads are skippable and doing as you suggest to tap top left does nothing. Closing the app only stops the ad. Next run, same ad same problem. This USED to be my go-to chess proggie but I'm looking for alternatives now. Can not find where to get the paid version either!",
            "I love this app. I've been using it since I was fairly new with chess and have improved significantly. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the computer doesn't seem to follow any commonly known openings, making it difficult to practice for playing against people.",
            "Really nice computer competition as well as the online experience is on point , well the 4 stars is because I think it would be alot better if u would add a voice transmission to this chess app. I understand that chess is supposed to be a quiet game but it would be fun to be able to talk shyt to one another at a drop of the dime... Just think about it I luv playing Chess , and also I sometime luv talking shyt at the same time...but for an over all I would and have recommended this app..",
            "You can play chess and you will find opponents but that's about it... No ranking system. Nothing obliging people to play so when you are in a winning position they just leave the game and never resign (7 games pending where I'm winning) No count system wins/loss No timed games or timeout if someone doesn't play for a day or 2 he looses nothing... You will end up with a list of pending games.. U can put assists (pieces in danger warning) no config possible 3 stars bcz u can actually play chess",
            "Its a cool chess app, only thing I don't like is. It disables me at times, giving the CPU or player an advantage. However, I'll take that as a compliment, for that is just what it takes to beat me, a combination of CPU, cheating and disabling."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

But one thing I don't like is whenever I watch ads to earn better things I always loose to the other team, I tried both teams ballet and Hip hop, but I keep 💯 loosing. :) and dont tell me to stay safe,😡",
            "Very good app! I love how you can dress yourself and everything! The only problem is almost everything is locked. Makeup, clothes, dance moves, and more. That's how the game get boring.. I mean, what the point?! You can got to the doctor , spa , or take a selfie.. All you can really do is put makeup on, go to the gym, dress up, and do dance moves all over again! I do the ballet and I am getting tired of using the same dresses again.. (Turn off WiFi if too many ads)OTHERWISE, GOOD APP!!!!!!!",
            "I really used to like Coco games☺ until I was wanting to get the full version of the game , so I clicked on it and it was $9.99 .Really?!?!😑And almost everything costs money 😒😾Also when I was playing the game I was going against Hip-hop we got a higher number then they did but Hip-hop won!😡Are number was 3,444,589 and Hip-hop got 900😐 I would give it 5 stars if it did not lie.😠😡😡😡",
            "I would 100% recommend! Grate app. When I'm bored I love playing this game, it makes me love dance even more! Also amazing job to whoever made this game :) oh and, other people are saying there's to many adds? Maybe it is just their device. On my device (iPad) I don't get many. Thank you for taking the time to make this game!",
            "Okay I absolutely LOVE this game. I love how you can choose Hip Hop or Ballet. They are both amazing. I just wish that more things would be unlocked for free, or at least like \"Watch 5 videos to unlock!\" or something. But if you're look for something fun to play and pass time, ( It's especially useful during Covid-19) I reccomend this game."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

First when the app tried to play an add it would come up with a screen that said the website can't be reached so I'd have to restart the app, and now whenever I open it it just closes itself. I tried restarting the app, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and I tried restarting my phone, But the issue persists.",
            "This game is so annoying it freezes after like 10 Minutes and is sooooo annoying the graphics are good enough and the controls are fine but please fix the freezing it's highly annoying I would give this game a 0 stars but that's not an option so fix it please this has such potential",

            "Very fun bit when a ad comes on it says this site has failed I tried everything u have to leave the game so you can still play I will change my rating to 5 stars when u fix this plz do I love this game and don't want to uninstall",
            "This is a great game!I have played this since 2015. But the reason I'm reviewing now is because I am bored.We need missions like bump 3 red cars or drive around the map and it gives u like 50 cash. The other reason is cos I feel like we need like way more maps and since I've stuck with the game so long I don't want to be let down by one update that has needed to be added. Only reason I have 5 stars is cos 1. I'm addicted and 2. U can turn off data for ads so idk y ppl complain about ads!"

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "The game was amazing, but a weird thing happened, I didnt open the app for a day or two. But when I opened it today the mission was different, the last time I opened it the mission was some sort of a car(Which is hard for me) but now its some red coins, when a game starts, it starts with a tsunami. Hmm so is that something bad?",
            "I used to LOVE playing this game... redownloaded after almost 3 years and it let me sync to my account but expects me to pay for the coin doubler again. And now it's $4.99 instead of the $1.99 or the 2.99 I paid for it. I'm pretty sure it was $1.99. Because I never spend more than that. But damn. Give me what I paid for... I mean if I repurchased it now I would have paid 1.5 times what it's worth maybe even a little more. Why can I get all my old stats but not things I purchased?!?",
            "I played this game since 2014 and it used to be fun. I would've given it 5 stars. I've recently downloaded it again. My problem is that I'm currently at level 13 and supposedly unlocked the +zombie upgrade. Yeah, it's unlocked, but it's still on a read-only function (grayish photo and description at the bottom, no \"buy\" button and price). Tried reopening the game, still unavailable. I really don't want to have to give up on this game. Hope you can fix it, thanks.",
            "It is a fine game. It is basic as an auto runner is. The catch is that you have an army of dumb zombies. When I mean dumb I mean that they fall mid jump. That is a challenge and not a bug (if it is, don't fix it devs). This would be a good game but I can't stick with the game. For one, the missions range from easy so luck based. The daily challenges are not enough to keep me interested and the gimmic is not (yet) fun. I grew tired of this and jumped to Jetpack Joyride because that is better.",
            "Loved this game. I totally recommend this game to everyone but it might get changed sometimes and all you have to do is restart the game and that's really annoying and when you do restart the game all your hard work goes down the drain I really hope this problem gets fixed"

            "The 'Go to App' when away from home. I like to read several reviews on anywhere I may visit. Gain a picture of what to expect & look for possible pointers for what to try, see or sample. We are all different & \"one man's meat is another man's position.\" Any venue can have an, \"off day\" ditto waiter, receptionist, chiefs, etc. It's an 'over view' I seek, a feel for a place. NB: don't just read reviews of places - but also reviewers reviews! Be aware of 'planted' (paid) reviews & reviewers.",
            "Good with booking a hotel, bad for booking a flight on Tripadvisor. The reason being is that I look on a different booking site for flight prices, compared this to expedia and expedia is the best bet for booking a flight as their prices make sense to me. Step up your A-game in the case of booking a flight Tripadvisor please!",
            "The best app for finding your way around a new place. It has all the restaurants and is almost always reliable, and is very useful for finding other things like attractions too. I wish it would remember more things when you switched off the app (ie switching to WhatsApp and then back) as its a pain to have to find the page you were just on, but it's still really a great app.",
            "You ruined the app. It used to be my go to app for restaurants and hotels, now it can't even find a location less than 1km from me. Not only that, when I did pull it from the map (which is also wrong) it said it was closed. What a joke. Don't expect me to use this app anymore.",
            "Frustrating at times, asks if you want to limit your results to the specific area you search for, but even when you do that, it still includes loads of suggestions that are further away...."

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

            "The game is good but the Heroes are to costly and we cannot get many gems. Please lower the cost and improve.",
            "First of all: Lower the amount of gems needed for other characters. It is just unfair the amount we need to get. 2nd: Make Raven available via Gem Purchase. That's just not cool needing to pay $19.99 for an amazing character. | Overall great game, gameplay is good skills too, needs a bit of work with Gem availability, though.

The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "SO good! I got this game not knowing anything about it. And when i started! It was amazing! I got controller compatability wich is really fun and is neat. Overall good graphics and addicting. You dont need to spend money on the game unless you are willing to support the developers. And there is barely any ads! (Besides ad rewards) im new and got some new cars!",
            "Good graphic, good control, best racing game so far. -1 star is the introduce of touchdrive auto drive which takes away players excitement although you have an option to manual steer but it became unfair since others just touchdrive. That's the only down side for this version. Update- uninstalled, seems like there's bug or virus that mess up with my phone. First came out ads issue, then cause my phone can't charge. Nearly goes into store to warranty my phone..",
            "One of the best arcade racer in the market. I'm having fun with this game on smart phone even more than arcade racers on pc. Just remember it's a game that relies on sales to keep it going, so be patient and don't go on a shopping spree without caring, cuz you can get a lot without spending much. And don't spend on any cars from classes higher than the ones from your current career. If you're in chapter 1 or 2, don't throw your money on S class cars. Each thing in is own time.",
            "The game was fine for the first few days but after that the game just crashes whatever I am doing in about 1 minutes time. Gameloft please do something about it or please tell me a way to troubleshoot this. If this wasn't a problem then the game is fantastic PS: I have a new phone and it can't be the problem on my device",
            "Ever since the last update, there's an advertisement that never loads and is just stuck. I can't even hit the back button. I have to close the app and go back in. It happens on my husband's phone as well, so it's not just me. I can't claim packs and use it to skip gas refilling. I just finally started spending my money on this game, and now it's giving me problems. Fix this issue and it'll be 5 stars from me"

Please resolve this issue ASAP because this game has trend breaking capability... Hoping a positive response from gameloft team",

The sensitivity is too poor if i want to look around the battleground some of the inventories automatically open up, you can fix this. 3. You can add more different kind of troops and heros. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY . Download the game . HAVE FUN 🤩🤩",

I enjoy playing the game & I love it but having this server reconnect issues every time I try to play it... all your games are great mostly the best but you don't care about uswho are playing them. If it not ads it server if it not that is logging issues why.. why do you promotes incomplete games bugs everywhere in your games. come on guys help us out here.. don't ignore our cries... we are your supporters",

            "I really... Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",
            "Why is it that I always get a 2 star superstar out of a premium I dont understand this concept is this luck or It is decided before itself that a 3 or a 4 star is not available in a premium otherwise this game is good! Keep it up!"

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

There is no fake Bugatti no fake Lamborghini or a fake Ferrari or a maclean I think there is much room for improvement for this game but overall it's pretty fun i guess especially if you just want to pass some time.",

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....💐💐🧡 I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

            "I love this game.its great and very fun. Please return this game back to when we could play it without data. I want to be able to play without data. Thank you. This game is best cooking game i have ever downloaded, but we are playing with money, (data) that's why am giving it 4 stars. Otherwise i ought to give it a 5 star. Please look into my request. Thank you.",
            "My favorite game that has actual goals to reach. I never put money into the game. There is a mini game you can win gems to help with upgrades and ads if you want to get extra coins, but are not required to play. It's definitely challenging. I do dislike how some upgrades won't help you at all get three stars on some levels though. So, there is a requirement for certain upgrades to win a level with 3 stars...but you won't know until you keep upgrading everything.",
            "The game is addictive, no doubt. Everything is very good, loved it. Giving a 3 coz it takes a lot of diamonds to pass a level and there's no such source of earning them. Playing a level over and over again because you don't have enough diamonds to update is totally frustrating. If you want us to pay so many diamonds for things so at least let there be a good source to earn them.",
            "Fun and challenging levels that test hand-eye coordination as well as cognitive acuity. Some of the restaurants have similar foods, but the builds are always fun and creative the further along you get. The only downside is the number of diamonds needed to upgrade and progress. Tech support has been fantastic. I lost my progress in 2018 and deleted the game out of frstratio. 2 years later they were able to restore my account. Thank you!",
            "The game is nice,i have to give that much to the developers. The issues i have with the game-the only reason i rated it 3 stars-,is that it is data consuming.You need data to do virtually everything in the game. Firstly I downloaded the game with data,then to play the game you have to connect to the internet at all times. And as if that is not enough, after acquiring enough coins and gems to buy a new restaurant, you would still need to connect to the internet to download its contents. NOT NICE"

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

The PC connected (telling me that I was limited to 5 mins), and worked very well, but then suddenly disconnected after a minute or so. When I try to reconnect, I keep getting an error \"Connection blocked after timeout\", and tells me there's a session limit, and to retry again in a minute. So I wait a minute.... and am told to wait another minute, then another minute. Some time later I tried again: I got a minute or two of access, then kicked out again My first impressions are that, unless I pay for the full version (we're talking £15 PER MONTH here!), this one isn't going to be any use to me, so I'm only going to give it one star - sorry!",
            "To the developer, you need to be more clear on the purpose of this app. People are often more stupid then average and down load apps because what they assume the purpose of the app. It works perfect for the intended use; i.e. helping move around apps and trouble shoot remotely. Not controlling games are all kinds of no sense Ive read in the comments. Smh"

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

There is plenty of other programs like this for newer versions of Windows, but I only needed my XP to be able to be controlled from android. Doesn't work for me anymore. If I upgrade my PC so that it would run Windows 10 etc, I'll find another way to control it. But I still use XP on this particular machine. So C Ya later. Maybe.",
            "poor experience - this app has bugs. always takes time to \"activate\" itself. on different occasions it says that I'm offline and there is no button to refresh the connection, so I uave to go and force stop it. Once it even told me that I use it for commercial purposes. Quite poor experience. It's decent, but you have the potential to make it way way way better!",
            "I am done. It was a quick and easy way to do certain things but then it changed to \"Commercial Use\" even though its for personal use. On top of that, the Commercial Use is limited to 5 minutes but will automatically kick you out after 45 seconds and you cannot log back in for at least another 3 minutes. Un-installed.",
            "I remember when this was a good service. These days TV cares more about harassing gamers than developing their product and it shows. Numerous settings are flat-out broken such as turning off lock on exit. Sad to see the good devs leave and the ones who remain are clearly lazy and incompetent. If the massive, insane loading times on this app don't tip you off, the broken functionality will.",
            "The latest update pretty much makes the app worthless. The connection between my phone and computer keeps cutting out constantly. I paid for a one year subscription and this last update has me thinking I need to look at other companies products."

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

I love this game before but i uninstall it because of those red censored thingy. But i installed it back hoping it will be fixed but man! I already reached the required level but it is still censored and I can't even see the skill and other staffs specially the wings 😭 please fix it.",
            "Fun to play. Iike that I can actually play the game a choose what I want and it not all preset like most phone games are now. You don't have to buy anything to get good. A lot of players haven't spend anything on it and are the best in the game.",
            "Disappointed. I feel like I can't even play. This game is about who spends more money. It doesn't have any matchmaking system so I can't even play the different game modes. People always kick me out from the rooms because of the BR and I can't even compete in PVP. Absurd.",
            "Very dissatisfied to see the anniversary event which is going now. It's not like what we expected as compared to other games it's totally wasted . We already compromising with bugs and other things . And again they put like this seriously not acceptable ......😒😤",

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "It's a very good game but I hate the fact that we can't save our progress anywhere. I had completed so much in my old phone, since I had logged in with Facebook and google play games I though my progress will be saved. Today when I installed it in my new phone it's showing to do everything again. Y r u doing like this guys. Please help.",
            "My entire profile has been wiped! I took a hiatus from Drift Max Pro and came back after some time only to find myself at tutorial level. Needless to say my profile was completely lost. I spent money and time to build that account and I know my complaints would be for not but maybe they read these. You hear me? What are you going to do? Message me so we can rectify this in some way. Otherwise your system is broken and you're stealing. You're lucky I ain't \"Karen\".",
            "Drift Max Pro in my opinion is probably the best drift game for mobile application as in regards to gameplay,graphics, longevity, everything above etc etc but please for the love of God do something about the f..king unwanted ads that pop up everytime a race is finished.Ads for extra cash & gold yes awesome but for the unwanted ads not being rude but you guys have created this game then you all at development can do something about these f..king unwanted ads for Christ sakes.",
            "Nice game but a fix is that whenever you tune a vehicle, a stat of it or two will only be available to do or show that \"PRO\" WILL UNLOCK AT LEVEL 4. If a class A vehicle so then Unlock at level 6 or 7. Fix this so the game will get full 5 STARS.",
            "U should add a thing that u can actually modify the cars... Put body kits turbos exhausts and stuff. It's the only thing that's missing but the game needs it. It's an unbelievable game I love it I almost finished it and some more options in the spoilers plzz. Amazing game good job"

We'll see what happens from here, but I may be deleting this game.",

Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",

        "title": "About Testosterone",
        "description": "Testosterone is produced primarily by the testes in men, although it also can be produced by the adrenal glands and other sites including adipose tissue and bone. It is responsible for testes descent and reproductive tract development in the fetus, development of male secondary sex characteristics in puberty, and the production of sperm. Testosterone production in men begins in utero, rises sharply in puberty, and then declines with age (Pic. 2). Indeed, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study showed that total serum testosterone levels decline by 1.6% per year starting at age 40. Testosterone is also produced by the ovaries, the adrenal glands, and tissues such as adipose tissue and skin in women, although serum concentrations are almost 20-fold lower in pre-menopausal women compared to age-matched men. Interestingly, testosterone levels also decline with age in women. This age-dependent reduction in testosterone is not restricted to humans, as it is also seen in older male rats and mice (>20 months of age) in conjunction with a decline in fertility, although whether levels decline in aged female animals has not been investigated.",

It is responsible for testes descent and reproductive tract development in the fetus, development of male secondary sex characteristics in puberty, and the production of sperm. Testosterone production in men begins in utero, rises sharply in puberty, and then declines with age (Pic. 2). Indeed, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study showed that total serum testosterone levels decline by 1.6% per year starting at age 40. Testosterone is also produced by the ovaries, the adrenal glands, and tissues such as adipose tissue and skin in women, although serum concentrations are almost 20-fold lower in pre-menopausal women compared to age-matched men. Interestingly, testosterone levels also decline with age in women. This age-dependent reduction in testosterone is not restricted to humans, as it is also seen in older male rats and mice (&gt;20 months of age) in conjunction with a decline in fertility, although whether levels decline in aged female animals has not been investigated.",

            "Great game, love the controls and the graphics. However, I don't like the way the matchmaking is working. I always get stronger opponents (generally way more agility or serve than me so I can barely hit the ball) and I'm not willing to put money in this game considering that it must be like that anyway. I would love a PVE mode like tournaments.",
            "It is a fun game but trophies thing is bad, like it locks higher tours if you lose trophies in lower tours. pro pass and purchases are expensive. Nevertheless, there is a need to spend money. Also, the game stucks sometimes in the middle of a match. In addition, sometimes the game does not load on my phone, it reaches to 74% then stucks. If the above are improved, it will be the best tennis game i played.. Improve the this please. Too much frustrating. Thanks",
            "This game totally sucks. At first I loved to play but I noticed constantly that it seems the game cheats so your opponent can win. So balls or superspeed for the other players even though I have great stats. This is a total scam game to get you to pay money. I'm pretty sure it's matching you with boys or the creators so you automatically gonna lose. I'm deleting this game because it is a total lie and scam. This game has made me want to stop trusting game sites. Your all in it for the money.",
            "Really fun. The controls are very easy to learn, and hard to msster. The stats and gear help, but a good player can beat someone with much better gear. So its not P2W. It takes time to open loot bags that you get for winning. And you can watch ads to take 15 mins off. Not bad at all. And no surprise ads either. You only watch if you want to. Would reccomend. If you like pvp, try it. If you like tennis, try it. If you like to waste time. Play it. Only cons are entry fees and upgrade costs.",
            "This game can be very fun. Unfortunately it glitches constantly. Opponent will appear to miss a ball. Then suddenly it is past you. Or you swing, and suddenly it is past you. Or better yet, you never even see a hit or serve, and suddenly your opponent has a point. Sometimes, an opponent who's has nowhere near the skill or agility is all over the court, and hitting zingers. It is really fun when there are no glitches, but extremely frustrating it isn't working right."

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "Not a huge fan of the battle mechanics.. the story is great, each character seems detailed.. my only quam is that I've done easily over 100 pulls for new characters and have pulled the same 10 blue tier the whole time. Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",
            "If there is a single game that I have enjoyed thoroughly through the years and have never been frustrated with, its sdorica! From the music to the story (which is a 12/10!!!) You cannot go wrong, give it a try!",
            "Im giving this one star because while I adore this game I can only play on wifi. I have a good 4g connection on my galaxy s9 plus and it keeps asking for a stable connection. Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

It's a shame as definatly used to be a much better app. Need jump to page number button too as slow to scroll though every page. It won't allow you to cut/copy text from Samsung Notes, so have to copy it to Samsung Email then cut/copy from there into Polaris. Text in columns can overwrite on itself.",

It always wants to save in the cloud, no matter how hard I fight. It saves 80% of the time, the rest of the time the docs are lost unless you spot it. I like it, it's easy to use, but I just can't trust it anymore.",
            "Potentially a great document creator comparable to Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Notepad. But it has caused extreme frustration & bother, particularly by its technological dumbness. The Polaris System (?Server) seems to recognise saved files in a different order from which they were created. Obsolete versions of documents are perpetually being saved whilst preferred versions tragically are erased. (Is this a part of all 'Cloud' Software Systems?)

Pros: Fast, nice UI, and easy to use Cons: Ads (inserted into downloaded pictures), seeing same ads, and a lack of a block user button. If I don't want to see the same user's posts, then I should be able to hide all, if they don't want to add such a feature. Overall, its better than the older third-party apps on the Play Store.",

Now, I'm constantly on here reading the true scary stories and felt compelled to write my own true scary stories! Needless to say, I'm completely addicted to everything spooky Reddit has to offer! 🎃🖤",
            "Some recent bugs: 1) Whole app crashes any time I select to edit a post. 2) When trying to create an avatar, as it constantly prompts me to, none of the images/thumbnails load, so it's useless and totally broken afaic. While I've not been an avid user until recently, I assume these are new issues. If not and these have been known issues, gyst.",

There's always something for me to enjoy, but that's only if the app doesn't randomly crash constantly and have to be completely restarted so anything you might have been working on is just lost (only on app). Still rather annoying. Only started recently....please fix!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Love you, reddit devs 😍😏😁",

That being said, for the traditional \"hanging out\" experience, r/All is always there. Also, the app actually works, unlike some other social media sites that couldn't make a functional product if you gave them 13 years and $1.1billion. (*cough* Tumblr *cough*)"

            "Really really need to be able to sort by earliest date with the years... If I want to start watching prime time etc from the beginning, I have to go alllll the way back through all the episodes.. When catching up on nxt i have to close my eyes while scrolling through all the epispdoes (in reverse) to avoid spoilers. Also open up the vaults already! More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",
            "Love WWE Network! I can watch anything from WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, NWA, all the territories, etc. It is so amazing! Also love all the original WWE shows exclusive to the app. If you love wrestling like I do I can't imagine my life without this app in it. I watch it everyday. For example I just binged every WWE Monday Night Raw from 1998 and just started 1999 season! UNREAL!!!",
            "Could be a lot better, I was still getting ads even though I'm a subscriber, I can't listen to shows in the background as if you leave the app it pauses the video you where watching the app needs significant improvements because of how much it's missing when compared to other streaming services",
            "I love the network..ive never had a problem with it and have been a member since 2014..how come its not letting me go on it. Ive refreshed a bunch of times and have gotten the same results which has been just lag and errors. Please help a loyal fan and customer out. Thanks",
            "Horrible. The ap will not allow me to choose Bell as my subscription option. There fore I cannot watch anything live on my phone. I use Google Chrome and still I get a 400 error message when I click on Bell. Very frustrated and unhappy"

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "The least you could do if you're going to flood a game with ads is give people the choice to pay to stop the ads. I mean, if you want people to have incentive to buy imaginary game currency, at least make it worth while to support your game to remove ads too. Also, it's not fair to make all the best guns cost gems. But that's pretty typical for a phone game these days.",
            "Great game once you get the hang of it. Too many ads though and if you get right to the end, there is a glitch. Your screen goes dark and you can't see anything and you get killed within seconds. FIX this issue and you have a very good game. There is even a glitch in the game where you can get 12000 pieces of gold with ease, but that I will keep to myself until the end glitch is sorted ;)",
            "This reminds me of some fps arcade games i used to play. Love it! What i don't like, the reason i give 3 stars, you have to pay to win. Requires too much time and effort in regular play to advance.",
            "best zombie game ever. i know, alot of people complaining about ads, turn off wifi. thats so easy. if you complain about having to spend money, actually you dont have to spend any single nickle. so calm down. its a good game. the developers have to get money so they put ads. the developers have to get money, so they put ingame purchases. so what?",
            "This game would be AWESOME if the damned prices for new guns were not so high. That problem alone makes the game unenjoyable to play. Either drop the prices of each of the weapons or give higher rewards for finishing quests or missions."

            "I just ❤❤❤❤ it. Such a amazing game.😀 I am SPEECHLESS ☺ I have a suggestion that if your team can make RAIL RUSH 2 with more new features. And if the game would be like when we get a rock egg we will always get something or the other. Whenever we take a tutorial like for Zombie Caves, Underwater World etc. It should give the full tutorial for that particular adventure.",
            "I loved this game but always when i collect a black coloured egg which has crackes on it, i get nothing in the second egg. That makes me very angry. Every time i collect the egg, it's empty!!! Please do not do this again. The graphics are absolutely perfect. Characters are superb. Well done. 👍👍",
            "I really like this game so much. I had this game in another phone. There are not really do much adds in it. The problem is that when ever I get a rock egg l always get nothing or something else in 1 one off them I normally get so much of nothing in but when l get 2 I get one thing and then l get nothing. That really makes me angry. Well please fix that problem. Well most off the things l like it and if bad things continue happening l will have to delete the game.",
            "Love it a lot and I played it for a long time and now also playing and lot of nuggets and collect trial passes and rock eggs and buy players I recommend u to play this game if u think the mb of this game is more.....but it is worth of it ....👍👍👍👍:-):-):-)⟵(๑¯◡¯๑)",
            "Nice 👍 I love this game because they have given us free trial game from passes and bad thing is all games are not unlock few are lock 🔐 but it's good nice and that's why Rail way rush get 4 stars from me I am telling from my side .

            "Used to function perfectly but for the last couple months the mobile deposit feature very rarely works. It says that the check amount doesn't match the picture and to try taking the picture again but it never resolves the error. Changing the background, light source, angle, distance and uninstall/reinstall doesn't make a difference. I've wasted so much time on this nonsense.",
            "I've always had a good experience with the app. I appreciate how Wells Fargo keeps me updated on new features, changes and privacy policy updates. I'm also not very tech savvy and the app. is very easy to navigate through and understand. Personally, especially in times like this, I'd rather do my banking from the comfort of my home, car, office instead of standing in line waiting.",
            "Great app. The easiest app I've ever used compared to the one that my credit union uses. Just point and it will do the rest for you. Other app that I've used were not as friendly and hard to take photos that I have to do it a couple of times. This app makes all the adjustments for me.",
            "On its own it's OK. Basic functions are all there but the UI and UX could use a some improvement. When compared to the banking apps of competitors, the design and layout feels a decade behind. Things that take 1 (e.g. swipe left or right) action on competitors apps take 3 on this app (e.g. tap menu, scroll to selection, select action). Not an issue if used infrequently, but the little things could get annoying if Wells Fargo was my main account.",
            "Great app. Makes online banking simple and easy to use. I have all my finances in one easy to use app. My only issue is that when I login sometimes the app doesnt recognize my password. Which is frustrating sometimes. But other than that it's a great app."

Sometimes when I want to get more coins by watching an ad, the game states that there is none to watch so I can only get only the minimum coins offered I don't know what, if anything, controls this or it's some obscure algorithm deep within the game's programming code or something controlled by whatever process, if any. controls the displaying of ads. It seems this behavior happens less if I don't pay $2.99 to disable ads after each game.",

What a great way to celebrate the 40 year anniversary! *Edit- changing my review. The game is working again. Minus two stars because of the loss of my progress and gameplay latency. Will be changing review as more changes follow.",

Unplayable!",

            "I really like this game, but I have one problem. Actually the problem is that the decorations are locked that's why If we try to win the contest the decorations are locked that' s why we are failed in winning the contest. And if we are trying to unlock the decorations its lost of our money. Please can't you try to unlock those decorations. That's why I had give only three stars",
            "This a very good game and fun to play. The reason I gave it two stars is that after making a cake, they show an ad..and no matter how much I try to, it won't close..I have to exit the game and restart, losing all my progress..The same thing happens everytime. This is the second time I installed this app. I was hoping for a better experience this time But....😔😔",
            "This game is very awesome and I like the graphics they have made. This is the most stunning game I have ever seen in my life. This is the second time I have installed this game. Please rate 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. This the most wonderful game play ever! I spend almost half of the day playing this. Thank you for the Table Time (TT). I love the way they have made the graphics. Me, my cousin sister and her father loves to play it all day long even when are doing work. Thank you.",
            "This game is very good , but there are lots of things which are not opens just like for example - doll cake . If we want to make a doll cake his face is not opens so what we can do and not only doll face is note open there are lots of things in this game which are not opens why , anybody will give me the reply 🤔🤔 why it's not opens , so that's why I don't like this game very much . 🤗🤗",
            "Very slow gameplay and very little of it. Half or more of the time you play will be watching very slow animations of things being done that you have nothing to do with. Cut the top of a strawberry? Wait while the game shows you it being put in a blender. This does not make for engaging gameplay. Not to mention the very first cutscene of the game stops as soon as it starts to show you an ad. Garbage."

The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "Good game! I really like the planes and graphics. But one thing. Can you try and lower the prices a bit, or make it a bit easier to earn money? It took me about 1 hr to earn a million. And at the level im at, you need a 4.5million dollar plane, so for me, it takes me like 4 hrs to earn it. And people who say \"DONT BUY AND SAVE YOUR MONEY\", you dont have to pay money, its a thing called grinding.",
            "The game is ridiculous! How are you meant to do the air rescue mission if the controls are overly sensitive and the plane for the mission is way to big and clunky. Not only that but you have a timer and getting the plane lined up is about impossible. Also the wing walking mission has a bug where the person and his little black things go all over the place.",
            "I think this game is the best plane simulator ever, I would give it 5 stars but the only problem It is that when you try to land it's a little hard because for the big planes The Landing places are small and sometimes the wings hit the little thing on the side of the aircraft carrier so it is hard to land with big planes. Also can you please lower the prices for the other planes because it took me about 8 months just to get about 700,000",
            "Nice Game Anyway. BUT WHEN LANDING, THE NOSE POINTS DOWN TO LAND, NO PHYSICS AT ALL. THE GEAR RETRACTS SO QUICK. Add Joystick Control, Pushbacks, Taxiing from the Gates and ATC. Add A380, ATR 72, A320, B737, CONCORDE, MD 11. SMOKE WHEN LANDING. ALARMS AND GPWS to make it more realistic. COCKPIT VIEW, CINEMATIC CAMERAS. RANDOM WEATHERS (For Free Flight) Day-Night Cycle.",
            "I enjoyed this game when I was 5. Now that I'm way older and that I have played way more realistic flight simulators (no offense), I now think that the in-game physics are... uh... not the best, to say the least. Then, I took a look at the prices for the digital planes, and then I rubbed my eyes, bought a new pair of glasses, replaced my eyeballs, and asked my girlfriend to read the price to me. Unbelievable. 35 CAD bucks for a digital plane. I proceeded to laugh uncontrollably, and rolled around on the floor. I started a free flight sesh, crashed my plane, and the plane exploded and turned black. Now that I'm really deceived by the physics, I respawned, and my airliner spawned on an aircraft carrier. Like.. how do you expect me to take off from there without colliding with the cabin?"

If this content can be separated, it will be very good because it will take less time for us to find the content. Thanks to you.",
            "I love this app but after the latest update it has so many bugs! I see latest updates in channels and chats but after I close the app and open it again, it send me notifications for that seen messages again and again! And the other problem is that I get the notifications for new messages but they don't load in chats and channels!!! It's so annoying... Please fix it .",
            "No way to delete my info. Installed to find no way to make calls. Very unclear about why the selected only 3 contacts to sync out of my list. Was hoping to be able to make voip calls but this does not replace a conventional messenger and phone. No dial pad. No video calls like I was under the impression were here. Just really unsure what the point of the AP is all together. Like is this just for messeging strangers? I don't want that at all.",
            "i updated the app last night and since then it doesn't shows the last message in some channels and groups. you can see the last message from chat list but when you open the channel it's not there. and it skips some messages in channels or groups. it also doesn't show the source channel when i forward a message to my own channel.",
            "I would give it a 5 star rating. The animation are great and the fact that I have been told that I can send file/s up to 2gb in size is great (Not done so as yet) The problem ⚠️ I am having is I receive no notification sounds. Just vibration. I have looked up and down on how to change it, but no joy😐"

Very sadly uninstalling.🥺😩",
            "Game is enjoyable but once you complete all the levels you can't progress further. Also there should be a proper character categorisation . There are only 3 types of characters; common ,rare and epic. But some characters can be found by special missions . So they should be categorised under legendary or exclusive . Further there should be new rooms and new powerups for minions.",

Shame as otherwise it was for me one of the best games. Edit: thank you for your answer but it still doesn't work. Not sure of my Player ID as I can't get into the game, after the initial video it gets stuck on downloading 0mb of 0mb 🤷🏽",
            "great game but wow ive had problems. they have this new update and now i cant play anymore it just says downloading. for a week. i contacted help got a ticket but no fix. and then years ago i played this spent a ton of money but my progress wasnt saved. now it says i should be able to get my current progress back thru fb but i have my doubts since I cant even get into the game at all. so great game but dont play. edit: weeks later and still nothing from help customer assistance. Edit: better now",
            "Honestly, im rating this game 4 stars, all the progress i made in the good ole days of Minion Rush in the Story Mode was lost, and i genuinly miss that satisfaction of passing levels and seeing that a new part of the lab gets made and unlocked by filling up the containers with jelly, honestly, its easier to get minions now compared to before and currency is WAY easier to obtain compared to before, all that its missing for me is that story mode it had before, but still, this is a great game!"

            "This game is awesome my favorite game on this is zombie mode that is super cool and just game I don't know what to say I like the first and the other one they're good but this game is very amazing I hope you have some more updates like you game modes and I hope you have a good Halloween🎃",
            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

When I also understood that review your edits and use the brush for Double Exposure, I was so stoked because the only problem I had with this app was that the image does not get inside properly and when I try to darken the added image, the 1st one gets lighter and then gets beneath. Although now I have no problems.",

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!!

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

Afterwards I tried to switch to my account and its still having the same issue. Tried to do a recovery of my account but it was impossible. The last time I played it was years ago and I just want to play it again now but im having issues. My infos were bound with my email and facebook but i do not remember my server etc. pls fix.",

Does VIP require real money or can I use diamonds. Game -makers, if you're listening, please clarify and fix it. Your system clearly says diamonds and makes it seems like any one with enough diamonds can use, and yet it keeps taking me to buy packs with real money.",

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall 👍👍",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

Losing points in a quest etc. because of an unskippable ad is pretty much the definition of annoying. Also the game got more money grabbing every update - no more update gems (instead Spike drops not even half the amount for a while), it's always the same few ponies on sale and everything else costs a fortune...",
            "I really like this game but one day it decide to forget everything i did and now i have to restart. Why cant there be passwords we choose to go with our usernames so we can log back in if it restarts or something like that. I am honestly upset about leaving a three star review but I have to. But other than that the game is great.",
            "I absolutely adore this app! I always watch the my little pony movies, seasons with my sister, and when I recently found out they had a game, I had to check it out. All the characters, their dialogues, is just spectacular. I love that there are many mini games in the game itself! Love the game.",
            "Amazing game!! I never played such a fun game, just one problem . In the events the time given is not enough last time I was just about finish the last round of the event and it finished . I humbly request to do the improvement . After all this is the best game i ever played.",
            "I love the game overall, but there is one minor thing that saddens me. They haven't added even a single new set to the Collections section the whole time I've been playing, and I joined in March. They didn't even make collections for really obvious ones like the Power Ponies."

The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",

I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL.

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Love the actual game of chess, but am driven mad by the ads, because you can't chose to turn the sound off beforehand, so they randomly boom out loudly with irritating music showing games I would never, ever consider playing..😡 Chess is a quiet, thoughtful game, or should be! May decide this one's not for me. When I turn my sound off, it should mean I want quiet.",
            "It's classic!!! You missing out on some fun/mind challenging experience. Dope classic, chess game it's surely a must have if you enjoy challenges and it's also educational(you get to play & learn at the same time), Patience is key & Planning is a skill!!! \"THIS IS A REAL DEAL\"... Download this game so you don't miss out on some extremely fun, challenging and exciting way to spend your free time.",
            "Enjoyably challenging. I would like to know why, most of the time I have an undeniably guaranteed win, it calls it a draw? Was the simulator designed to cheat like an angry child, or is it a glitch? The only thing missing is the visual of the compu-child flipping the board over and running away crying. Please, stop this, its quite annoying and off-putting.",
            "The best game I ever played! Its a realy amazing game. Its graphics are also too good. And if you do not want to see ads, it can also be played offline! In this lockdown period, I play my turns and timepass. In every stage when I unlock, it becomes more difficult to win and sometimes I even get confused! Its so interesting and attractive. I recomend to play this game and stay HAPPY!",
            "It seems unfair many times. It shows different rules for the participants. Rules are not same for both sides. It allows himself to move anywhere any time but not to us. If computer is going to lost the game it will not accept their defeat but ask for settlement."

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",

I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",
            "30 second ads, 20 second gameplay, rinse, repeat. Greedy ad revenue grab by developer. Hey developers, are you listening? It's actually faster to play the game, start an ad, force quit the game and restart the game. That's faster than watching an ad every single time.",
            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

            "It's more difficult to play. I currently have Bolo to fight, my stats are way higher and still not able to beat him. Come on!. Its until I exhaust all the gifts and points. I'm not saying the game should be very easy but we both should have the same level playing ground. I sense that the developer are running out of levels, hence the game has been made unnecessarily difficult to move to the next level. I'm going to end up abandoning this game Smh",
            "The characters are very realistic and is a game worth playing. Great work NEKKI. I have played all your games. You gave us nekki = encouragement. Love all your games. I have played shadow fight 2 and it was great. Shadow fight 3 is better still. But I have one problem. I have started playing the game in my father's phone how do I play it in my mother's phone. Please reply. Father has to go to office and I can't play that while. This is the best game ever. This is my favorite game in the world.",
            "THE best fighting game for android. For people who say its a pay to play game,well its nonsense . I never had a problem no need to pay but you have to play hard and i kinda have like 40 legendary cards so it dosent force you to pay. Events are cool will give you more chances of getting legendary cards . ! NOW JUST WAITING FOR PVP! Please make it happen real fast!",
            "So, this game has good graphics ,but the thing is that when we fight duels if gives us chest ,but if we keep getting strong oppenents which is better then us , then there is 60% that we will lose . And then we will lose trophies and then we cant get rewards that we want at the end of the season , so i hope NEKKI helps this and gives us Like not very strong oppenents like i am at 987 power and when i fight , the oppennent is 995 power , that will be much easier and i will appriciate this game.",
            "The thing i like about this game is that it has realistically functional moves in an environment that does not disregard the laws of physics. Well, there's this shadow energy bit in the game which is quite magical...u can call it a fantasy or something. But hey, a little supernatural element is essential for a good action game. However, it's quite easy you know, it has simple controls, and some of the moves of some weapons can be spammed to win almost any battle."

            "The bad; pin action is lacking and seem to be glued to floor. Wobbling pins rarely fall. The good; the ball action is quite good for the most part although speed control doesn't seem to be an option. Getting the ball to hook is a challenge as once released there is no control like other apps. It's very different from most apps in that everything is available from the start. The alleys and choice of balls ready to play. The music is different for all the alleys and mostly very nice listening.",
            "Reducing my rating front a 6 start to 2. Ads, the address have become nasty, obtrusive, annoying. I play this game far less nose than in the past because all the ads play sound and I found this out the first time in an environment where my phone should have been very quiet. What changed, greed in sure. This same shirt of thing is happening with all kinds of apps and it's really causing me to rethink what things I need and those I don't.",
            "Notice to all gamers if you want to play the games you have installed on your devices without having to be bothered by ads turn off your mobile data before you start the game and the game will play fine and the ads will not get through, no more ads ever. Its enough to have to pay for the use of the device we should not have to pay for the ads also, enough is ENOUGH!!!!!!",
            "Such a bad game because there's too many ads, when you aim left or right it goes the oppisite direction and the graphics are so bad in this game such a silly bowling game, other bowling games are way better than this one, Im uninstalling this game because it sucks👎👎👎",
            "Great game it's fun and time consuming but it would be better if you can add more colors to play with and more design and there is A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF ADS so it's awsome also you should add a computer mode with different difficultys it's a fun game I recommend it for everyone"

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's.

Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

            "I downloaded this app and it was fun. I didn't mind the ads because: 1. I'm in a zone where I'm comfortable with ads. 2. I live in a Third world country. But the only problem it has is that it keeps crashing. I know, I know I should just update the game but here's the thing, when it says that I have to uptade, then I go to the app store, IT'S. NOT. THERE. This is also a message to the developers of Android that maybe they should fix their phone and make sure this does not happen again.",
            "I've read in the reviews that there are like millions of ads, but it's alot better if you just turn off your WiFi/internet. Here's a suggestion: Any game that lists itself as offline, turn off your internet. I also read in the reviews that it's laggy as heck, but it seems they've fixed that problem. Overall, it's a fun game! I just subtracted one star for the ads.",
            "Decent enough game play. Way too many ads. I have my mobile data and wifi turned off just to be able to actually play the game for more than 30 seconds at a time... but here's the real kicker... I had $1001 and purchased an upgrade for the shovel that says $340. But I only have $381 left. I even watched the second upgrade to make sure I didn't hit anything wrong.... where'd the extra $280 go???? It did this with all the tools.",
            "It's an interesting concept for sure but unfortunately the stability of the game is almost nonexistent. It literally could be from toning down the ads that cause the game to crash every time an ad boots up but in 5 minutes of game time it crashed three times. It is also very laggy which adds to more crashing. If these problems were addressed then it could be a very popular game, but until then it's... lackluster.",
            "Yet another ad delivery service disguised as a game. There are many games out there that have figured out how to offer rewards for watching a video, this one does too. Why they think they need to add non-consensual ads is beyond me. If people don't watch enough ads in your game, you're not offering enough value. It's simple."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

Kinda stupid sorry for being blunt. But you guys have to know there is no way you can open a bin file on an android, and since this is Google play. All devices will mostly be running on Android software,so i mean, come on. The fact that it even downloaded a bin file at all killed it. There will be, no redemption, coming from me.",

When I installed the game on my new phone (LG Stylo 6) it had no issues until it start freezing up and I have to restart the phone everytime I want to play. Looking at the reviews, everybody is having the same issue. Thought it was the phone, it's the game that is messing up. Please fix the issues that everyone is having with the game.",
            "If I were leaving this rating 2 years ago it would be 5 stars. Played it through to the end and enjoyed it. Got a new phone and just reinstalled a few days ago to play it again, and the screen freezes every few minutes, forcing an app restart and loss of current level progress. We all want to like your game; honestly there's a lot to like. But you have to fix it so we can actually play it first. Going by older reviews, how have you let a problem this obnoxiously game-breaking exist for so long?",
            "A little glitch now and again, makes you die, but the game is so good, you don't mind playing the run over. I beat this game before. Got 3 stars in all levels. Delete it and now downloaded it again and I am starting a fresh. The thing is it is so good, it's like my first run at it. Please do a sequel",
            "is this game still alive? Even I downloaded my other phone because I think some phones are not capable of this game, but still its crashing like hanging in no time after one to two levels, Please I really love this game since 2015 After update many bugs aren't fix yet, Please if the creator still alive, Please fix this lovely game, I'll just uninstall this game and install again until I see your replies or updates...Thanks",
            "If I'm very lucky, the game won't freeze after just 2 minutes. Because the freezing, this means if I need to find 10 or more clues, it becomes impossible to find them all to proceed to the next level. Don't get me wrong: I love this game and have installed it on all of my devices, and I will delete it on my tablet once I'm finished posting this review. PLEASE fix the freezing!"

            "Updated 10/31/20: The app is totally unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but I can't hit a single button on it. Completely useless. Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

            "The game is good, but while youre in the game the car feels weightless specially in multiplayer mode. Once you've been hit by another car, you'll just fly into the air like the car has no weight at all. Plus, if you drift in corners and you are hit by other car you will loose your grip and driftline. I don't know if you guys, the developer is playing jokes on making a drift game on mobile to earn money. Learn to make a good game first before selling us anything. For now, fix it!",
            "This game is a lot of fun, the controls are smooth and it's not gimmicky, the cars function like normal, like if you go to fast into a corner you will understeer and the hand break isn't a \"push to drift button\" like other games, I hope the dev is working on more content cause this game is so much fun. My only complaint is that the game is quite grindy with all the different things you have to do to get all the stars each race.",
            "This game so far has impressed me very much. Not Forza graphics, but they are amazing for a 121 Mb game. There are 15 cars you can buy! (In game or cheap purchases with real money) I think there are 3 or 4 maps. (For single Player) So you do a practice run, and then you race with AI. For multiplayer, you need to collect 20 stars, which will take you about 10-20min to unlock. It is very fun. You can get upgrades with your money, buy new cars, get paint jobs and more. In game you can get boost 2x",
            "Almost perfect rally game. If possible I would rate more than 5 stars. Really good controls and graphics. Only in future updates I would like to see more realistic damage on the cars. And maybe another track - a city track for instance. Overall this is the best rally game I played from play-store. Keep on developing this game please!",
            "Love new track in canyon. But new update had bug. I know don't just for me or other else had this problem, the handbrake can't engage when where necessary. They didn't work so well when we still on acceletor and want to using handbrake or brakes. It's need to tap twice also cause lag of reaction make me crash. Old version perform this thing so well. Maybe you guys can fixed this. Btw, still excellent game ever"

            "Not even worth half a star. For one, the game is a poor excuse for a bootleg Clash Royale rip-off. Second the game developers failed at the match making system because you end up going against players as much as 3 levels higher with very strong cards. There is no strategy other than paying for the cards with your money. Pay to win game. See how little the developers care about the fanbase, because there are no responses. Why? Because it is an obvious sign that they are just in it for money. Sad.",
            "The game is great, UI is awesome. It lags sometime but that can be due to your internet connection as well. What i hated about this game doesn't have a \"level playing field\". The randomness of opening any card from the chest during play is not the right way to go about this game! It provides a luck factor which is not ideal for a strategy based game like CC. What can we do instead: start the chest with the least maina cards first and after all the 12 cards are opened, then do a random shuffle!!",
            "Love this game. Been playing for a long time but it could use at least one update other than the rebalancing of characters abilities. I am at level 11 but can be beaten by a level 6? Ridiculous. Plus, honestly, I prefer the daily games more, but that does not ever increase my castle level. Ridiculous! Overall I am addicted, but I would rather not keep giving my money away for no real benefit.",
            "The game is good. Graphics are good, characters are good. The problem is that it happens many times that match do not get start even though I have a stable Internet connection. And in a clan when we try to battle, it do not enter me in match and i lost the match. It is quite annoying. Fix it and i will give you 5 stars.",
            "Now I played for about a Month, the tournament is around. STOP❗ .... Game not worth it. Can't compete if you don't have the Super High Powered Cards to win. Don't get me wrong the game is fun if on Regular Mode, great match making. BUT The game chooses cards randomly. Your opponent can get there best cards first. While you get your Higher Seed Cards. I Repeat, I Repeat, \"There is No Strategy to this game\" -- The Higher Payer wins❗"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I enjoyed it alot, but I finished it really quickly. I loves it so much tho. I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

            "I like it when i first used it. It was convenient not until it started to gets errors after some time of using. Often times, i already submitted the quizzes and activities way earlier than the due date (for example , i didnt open my edmodo account for like a week but then when i open it recently, my quizzes had already been answered without me taking it, and some activities that i had already taken the day after it was posted on this app, it was resubmitted late without me resubmitting it.",
            "There is a plethora of virtual classroom apps now. Edmodo, Google classroom, Microsoft Teams,...blah, blah, blah. They all have their individual strengths and weaknesses. One issue I have with all of them is how well they work across devices and ecosystems. Edmodo is no different in that it is loaded with confusing features, that look and respond differently in android, ios and windows and as a result it is a mess to navigate through and use.",
            "Well, The application is bery helpful for online learning during this pandemic. But If you upgrade the appearance of the app such as addong dark blue and black theme, It will look more cool, though black printed letter on white paper is very suitable to see. But this is a modern century. You can add black theme.",
            "I'm giving 5 ☆ for Edmodo in general. I don't find the app as well-designed or as full-featured as the web site -- i would give it about a 3.5/5. The app is good if your want real-time notifiations on your mobile device, which can be important, e.g., if you need to approve students joining.",
            "Although Edmodo is the first-choice-app by most institutions, I think there are much to be improved on. There are less icons in the cover phase and that is what is important in making the app user-friendly. It should be made simpler yet easy to use especially it used by varying ages."

            "I've been using Google Maps for years, and update my timeline every day so I've got an accurate tracking record of where I've been. And then, today, I find that most of the data for this and previous years has suddenly disappeared (it was there yesterday). Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",
            "This had been one of the most useful apps I ever used. But for the last several weeks it is not responding. I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",
            "Stopped working. I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",
            "Terrible! Google maps has been my go to for years on every phone I've had now over the past week the maps won't load the addresses and won't give directions.

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

            "This is a great game with stunning graphics and controls. I really love the bike designs. I seemed to notice that if a level is finished with race bonus, you don't seem to be able to go back to that level. This makes the game to end if all levels are finished. Apart from that everything is awesome. If you want to download any bike game, I recommend this for you.",
            "This is a good game that deserves 5 stars, even more than 5 stars. But the only problem is that when one gets to a certain level, it frequently freezes while playing and this is irritating. I uninstalled it and reinstall it after 8 months with another phone; same problem persists. Pls.try to fix this. Thanks.",
            "Great game ! Fantastic graphics, good bikes. The one problem is that I can't play multi-player, but it's OK. And one that you cannot play the next chapter unless you cross the particular level while the level cannot be completed everytime in previous chapter that's why I m giving it 4 stars . The thing I like is that in every chapter there is a boss race in ending.",
            "This game is good but somehow dont let me pass level 12 even though I crossed it so many times and I go on level 13 but when I exit the app and go back there after few hours or refresh it, it makes me come back to level 12 which is annoying and frustrating. Please let me know how to fix that and why doesnt it save my already done levels. Thanks.",
            "I had never seen such a fantastic graphic game in a smartphone before.Hats off to the producers for this extra ordinary game. I will recommend everyone to play this game.But i'm giving 4 stars because the developer got the bikes' level wrong. For example, Ninja H2R is the current fastest bike, but they got a BMW 1000RR infront of the ninja. That doesnt make sense. So i request the producers to make a real-study on the bikes and make some improvement. Only this one got me annoying.."

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

            "I like what the app offers, but I cannot get it to stop freezing up. I've used it on my smart TV, laptop, and phone. It will freeze and the whole app has to be rebooted. Usually at least 2 or 3 times per episode. Very frustrating.",
            "Don't get me wrong for rating the app with one star, I do love this app but, the problems are the ads, and when I tried to subscribe, it said I can't do it at the moment, so when I checked the app store for the apps that are (subscribed) the only one that showed up was viki. And guess what? I still have got few weeks until the subscribtion expires but still all the shows and movies are locked, so please tell me what is going on and what is the problem here",
            "Im unable to fastforward drama or backward it,each time i leave the app to do something when I'm back i have to start the same episode from the begining pls fix this,i appreciate your efforts on this app but still needs to do better,it is really annoying.",
            "I really like this app! My main concern is the advertisements. Okay, I'm actually not too bothered by how frequent they are, I'm a patient person and I understand that's how the app is able to run, but sometimes the ad has trouble loading and freezes. A 30 second ad will have me wait two minutes bc it takes so long to load. And I know I can get vikiplus to avoid ads but I'm poor. Besides that, the quality of the dramas are clear and the captions are well made!",
            "It's really wonderful application .it's help to find lots of drama here. Am satisfied with this.but the problem is with resolution because we can't adjust what we want, sometimes network can't help to watch in that time we only can help with adjust the resolution but here there is no adjustments in this application!. can you fix with that others wise it's a good app👍"

The concept I find is kinda boring and need more update on this game you must update the graphics . Also add an option for control sensitivity. I think this game is not going too far because if you don't update it even if it has 100 million download you will not get the the rating for the game. that's all I have to say",
            "Just started this motor cycle racing game. I will let you know how I like it after playing for awhile. So far really good. That's All Folks!!! Played first 6 tracks taking 1rst place. But now I do not have control of the bike. I went back to the first bike I started the game with. Ma quale. Still have the same problem? It's as though my phone cuts out and loss of turning ability with it. Sorry. I love the racing game. Reminds me of Moto Racer. Hope you can fix the bug.",
            "It is really good game . In bored watching movies then I think that I open play store I see this game . But I think a game will come 1 hour. So I deleted all games like that. But I installed this game there was only 10 seconds only. I think that it will be more Seconds",
            "The game is very good but it's graphic and controlling is not good. It's controling is very bad.on 100kmph it don't turn. And after modifications bike doesn't performence is not too good. Although the game is good.I suggest everyone to play this game.",

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "Block craft is an amazing game! I only see a few problems. When I watch a add for more blocks it does not give me my prize.Please try to fix this! Also I would like to add a friends list so you could vistit your friends village. Besides that it is a really exfun game! Also can you buy things with your coins? That would be very helpful! I dont have any gems. One more thing. It gets pretty upseting when you run out of blocks. Its best if you don't level up. You really should get this game!",
            "Well Personly this game is AMAZING and you can build WHATEVER YOU WANT! So i recomend to play this game and Going to the build button on the right and clicking it, it gives you many different options when you level up you'll see more buildings and so you can build yourself your own personal house and stuff so i hope you have fun playing this game!",
            "Block Craft 3D is a nice game. You could get ideas from other's villages. You could buy pets, doors 🚪, and some others. But please 1 tiny thing. Can you fix the credit card issue. Cause I'm 10 and I don't have a credit card number. Way far from that, I love the game and Thank you!",
            "The game keeps closing for no reason and it's annoying when it gets stuck and when you are walking it makes you go through the building or through the wall. The cool part is that you don't have to build stairs. if you build a tall building and a single file building on that wall if you take out two blocks and stand under it and place on block under your avertar you will go right to the top of your building almost like an elevator",
            "Bad game You can't fly without paying, There is no survival mode, you can RUN OUT of blocks in creative mode, you have to wait 2 and a half hours to get them back. Speaking of blocks, you only get like 40 blocks for free. You can unlock a maximum of 20 blocks at a time for an unreasonable price. Bad game. Did I mention that you can't sneak?"

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "So I loved this game and I paid for no ads, and got all the monsters. But yet I guess now that I'm towards the \"end\" I have to watch an ad to play. No problem but 1. I paid for no ads. None. And I can't watch the ad to play your game. It keeps saying there's no video available, try again later and freezes. So over all. Love the actual game and game play, but don't waste your money and be fully prepared to not be able to move forward in the game. I got to 77, I passed. I can't play the other 3.",
            "My daughter loved this game but since she got to level 61, she can't revive. If she does, the character moves but the screen doesn't move with her. She also is having a problem with the repair alphabet rooms. She's on room F, has done everything, but it won't reward her or unlock the next room. Gutting for a 6 year old. I think she's finished the game, she's just replaying some levels now.",
            "I love this game, but as soon as I tried to paint on room 2 everything froze, I tried turning my phone on and off, closing the game... nothing worked! It might of been a virus but I'm not sure, I loved this game so much and ended up having to uninstall it then reinstall. I have had to start ALL OVER AGAIN 😠😠😠 That is why I have to give it a three out of five, sorry! It is a really fun game though.",
            "I originally had this game on an Amazon tablet where the ads are contained. After upgrading my son's tablet to a more powerful android device I re-download this. This game is flooded with microtranaction and ads even after paying the 2 dollars to \"remove ads\". What this $2 doesn't include is the need to watch 30s ads for each level after level 16 everytime you play a lvl. This is false advertisement and dishonesty around paying $2 to \"remove ads\". DO NOT download for your kids. I want my $2 back",
            "I give this game a 1 out five because everytime I try to play the game it kicks me out I haven't evan got to see if the game was nice cause it kicks me out . I don't recommend this game for anyone, it just takes up space that you can use for another app that actually works!!.very bad quality, very bad game!!!!!!!!!"

            "What's up with this app! Every time I save a few hundred rubies and the round I'm in is coming to an end, magically the marbles roll backwards. Yeah right! I didn't ask, request, or click the icon to waste 100 rubies buying ONE fireball. Yes, I said ONE! It 's remarkable that as soon as I earn 100 or 200 rubies the marbles magically roll backwards one or two times on their own USING 100 OF MY RUBIES FOR \"ONE\" fireball. Any suggestions on how to disable the magic button?",
            "Played this game for a while. I'm currently on level 1,749 and for the past two days have been unable to collect th 30 rewards after each game. I've cleared the cache and still nothing. It's so frustrating because at these levels you need more gems to use as the levels get harder. If not working by tomorrow I will be uninstalling the game and finding something else.",
            "I enjoyed this game up to a point. Level 332 to be exact. Previous levels - albeit with different degrees of difficult - are all beatable. Not this one. I guess the game creator wants players to start buying into the gazillion of ads at level 332. Games are supposed to be fun and fairly easy, not anxiety feeders. And the ADS. Oh.my.hat. I simply cannot deal. I urge you to relook at these terrible levels and make them beatable. Until such time I will have to resign. Fix 332!",
            "How on Earth do you pass level 332…? The string is just too long. This level is unplayable. Come on guys, either fix this level or I delete.... I've been playing this level for about a month now, and I just can't get through. ALSO The angle of the shooter is too acute, almost no chance for errors About 3 updates later and still cannot beat level 332. Beginning to be a waste of time",
            "Okay. I rated the game 1 before because very intrisive ads that practically breaks the game. Ads behave better now though they cause unresponsiveness at times. The levels also seems to stay on challenging instead of impossibke. I wish there is some endless mode where we just want to play at a desired level of dificulty and not bother with anything else. Sometimes we just want to do stuff for the sake of it. No goals, no agenda. Just doing it for its own sake."

It is children game, please unlock them. Other than that it is really a nice and good game .Please please please please please please please please unlock them for ads.",
            "This is like a real cake making it is very very nice game. I give five stars to it. It give teach me how to make a cake it is so nice game I share this game to all my friend's, It is really very very nice. It is really awesome game. This is so interesting game. I love to play this game, But some of them are locked, I request you please unlock all. It is very addictive. It is the best game for making cakes. But it has limited flavours, I think it has more flavours like baneela, kaccha mango etc",
            "It's a awesome game....we can do every thing what ever we wish but some of the them are locked... But the game is so interesting..... And I love to play the game...its very nice to play...... I'm giving four ☆ for this game because some of them are locked ... Please change that..one.. Then it will be the perfect GAME...... And this my feedback...I think it will be helpful Thank you...😊",
            "One star only because I have to. Boring. Expensive (not that I would spend a dime). Ads are ridiculously intrusive. This could be a nice and relaxing game if you would cut down on the amount of ads. You could offere more decorating options without a price tag attached.",
            "I like this app but when I download the Things at time they say that give money that time things will get. Please, please, please, please Give that free. When we make cake that time we get star so we will give that star get things Please, please, please Make in this way. Please, please, please."

            "This is the coolest match 3 rpg I've ever played. The tutorial is lacking, especially about spells and the repair mechanics don't account for the last ad watch. I just want to keep playing. The art is phenomenal. FIX AD REPAIR mechanics: totally fubar. The countdown variable doesn't work. However, the game is awesome! The artwork is killer. The meditate function is so cool. The off world mechanics to level up are totally cool. Take advantage of off world. Love this game.",
            "For me addictive, it's like a D&D kinda board game you go around squares and encounter various things monsters,caves etc also not a hugely P2W game BUT upgrade your gear as if not you'll get slaughtered I've only spend under £40 and I'm battling monsters with double my HP. Also make sure you have decent spells",
            "Do not download this game!!! They cheat on so many levels to try to force you to pay money. Tried numerous ways to play the game without forking over the dough - impossible!",
            "This game is incredible so much fun. Combines tiles combat with reg style game play. Just incredible. I have yet to see a game that is similar. You will enjoy it if you gibe it a chance",
            "Game sucks cause it gives all the skulls that u use to do damage with to the computer characters. U get 2 sets of skulls out of 20 for like 20 or 30 damage and most enemies r at least at 80 hp. Give the skulls to the player 2. No wonder everybody deletes it. Only care about money."

I have not heard the sound design yet (been playing with volume off) but I hope its the same as before. That is my real only complaint. If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

Thx Edit: oh I think it was my mistakes. I did it for 100 photos/set to restored but when I tried 10-20 photos/set, none of it was blurry. Maybe that's how it goes. I also tried to restored some videos and it turned out great. Five stars!",

Then, with 128 Gb sd-card, or cloud storage, it would be unstoppable!",

            "It works, bit I find so much is pointless to a basic user, I don't need scientific mode on 100% of the time, and I'd like M+/- buttons instead of having to mess with copy and paste. Give us a basic and scientific button to toggle between the modes.. PS to the people complaining about the clear, press and hold the backspace button and it will clear",
            "OK, but a waste of memory since I have to download another calc app for converting F°/C°, gal/litr and ft/mm etc. Samsung has that inbuilt. So there's is better. I don't use the scientific operations, so looking at them all the time is visual clutter. VERY ugly app. Lastly, in all that clutter you can't give us a memory +/recall key OR a simple clear/all clear key. You know, keys that are found in just about EVERY calculator anyone has ever used EVER. /smh",

            "Have booked a few tours before and wouldve given them 5 stars for the clear descriptions and good value. But I was disappointed by the latest experience where they cancelled my booking just 3 hours before the event was supposed to start - and then I realized tour reviews are only based on confirmed bookings (I.e. all those who had their bookings cancelled do not have a chance to express their opinions). I have a whole empty afternoon in the city and it's too late to rebook anything now.",
            "We can book hotels, trips, buy sim card and do lot more. It provide information about things to do int he places we visit. It gives nice offer on trips. Easy to book. Its very useful in buying tickets of famous places. Otherwise have to stand in que for long time. We can earn reward points too which can be used for bookings. Highly recommended.",
            "The latest updated app (downloaded on 6 Sep) keep crashing when i tried to redeem my voucher. End up i have to pay cash because the store has already prepared my drink. Is there another update soon? This version has problem. Previous ones were working fine.",
            "Not offer good tickets and price. I bought from them 3 tickets 529$ once I reach Dubai parks and Resort I found only the motion gate is opened and the ticket for 3 persons were 150$. I emailed them and phoned them and they didn't solve my problem",
            "I start using this app but i dont get any code number when i want to do 1st booking. I can't proceed with the payment. No code sent to my phone number."

            "Well the game is petty good but when i get a wide open 90% it misses and i cant stand that and when you go for a dunk it automatically just like looks like you're doing a layup but like why does it have to be in slow motion and when I go to unlock character I mean a new ball it just new ball action or or closed it just says new ball a lot and then he doesn't even show nothing like the game and then I'll give you a 5-star rating because this game should be like NBA 2K 20",

            "Amazing app. My system not only is fast now but with a lot of free space memory. Sure it's not a miracle cause if you want's more then you'll have to move files to external or pc by yourself. But do what him promise! Great app with easy commands and fast learning functions to users. Even my grandmother still using now :)",
            "It works very well, but i dont see much space freeing up in my internal storage..",
            "It's just useless. The app takes too much time in scanning and you need the pro version to clean the cache junk files.",
            "Seems laggy, was taking too long to scan files. A lot of these apps were designed before phones got smarter had faster processors and bigger memory and own file managing software. But I'm sure it works well on older phones.",
            "Doesn't clean! Only seemed to cool down my battery, but when I try cleaning it continually scans and then i feel my phone hearing up again! So it's over running my battery doing the scanning.... that hasn't stopped after several minutes."

            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",

            "I LIKE this game so much! I've tried it on Nightmare mode. And it was red and jelly, but it had spiders. But a army of them they looked like the spider from granny chapter one. But they could not go upstairs. I escaped! But in a boat. I tried to escape the front door but the only problem was the hand wheel was not working right. I got everything but just missed a step LOL! This gets a star for effort and credit because this game is awesome! :)",
            "I know this game is too much interesting and too much fun.. tho I can't play that, because whenever I install this game it keep crashes and says \"Unfortunately Granny: Chapter two is stopped\". It happens after opening the game and accept the privacy policy. But I watch it's vedios in Youtube, it seems funny! I wanna play too! Can you solve that problem, \"DVloper\"? I hope you will! Thanks for making this great game! I have never played it before, so I have rated it with 3 starts. If the problem f",
            "I loved this game very much😍😍😍. I played this game many times in Practice Mode until I mastered this. But there is a glitch that you should fix. When Granny reached the stair in the 2nd Floor and I left the door open, I hide under the bed, she is only at the end of the stairs, and WHAM!!! Instant jumpscare. Please fix it and all of the rest of the glitches. Thank you😘😘😘.",
            "This game is really good! Even better then the original Granny game, because: easier to find items, and new endings. And It's more easier to get the helicopter ending for me. (For some reason) Thank you for making this game! And the easier way to play the game with an enemy is with Grandpa. Thank you the developers for making this game!",
            "This game is like ossom. I think that the first chapter of this game is a little bit hard for me .It seems that the house was small but there were too much of secret doors .But in this we can easily explore the house 🏠 in the practice mode.GRANDPA has added a lot of attraction in this game. I had goosebumps whenever GRANDPA says I SEE YOU !!!😁😁. LOVE THIS GAME SOO MUCH 😘😘😘"

There are some things that could be better, like the death animations and the kill animations, but other than that it's an amazing game, 11/10 would recommend.",
            "It's really great! I've been playing this game for a while now and it always entertains me. Would've given it five stars but there's a problem. The game crashes when my shark dies and then when I reopen it, I don't get the gold or exp I had earned. It doesn't happen always, but the crashing rates have increased. Please fix it... It's hard to play 10mins in one round and then earning nothing at all. Thank you.",
            "This game is super awsome! But just one thing about it: The larger sized sharks. Once you get near one you pretty much can't escape unless you have a lot of stamina. And once you die from them and press the \"Save me!\" button you have almost no time to swim away, and then they bite you once and you're almost dead. I just think you need to give an 8 second head-start before the larger sharks can catch you.",
            "This game is so freaking awesome!!! However, the control system could use a ln addative, a joystick option that keeps the joystick in a fixed place down in the left hand corner, oh and the health drain is ridiculous! Health shouldn't drop that rapidly, you should maybe.... fix that, please? Other than that? GREAT game!",
            "This game is amazing. No pay to win. Great amount of skippable ads. You eventually get every shark from grinding enough. I just grinded out 280 gems and bought the Robo-Shark. Great time killer. Especially without Wi-Fi :P Get this game it's so worth it. Ubisoft, this game is amazing and almost perfect. Just a bit of tweaking and this game is number one. Great job!"

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

            "Good game. 4 stars because if u play 2 long the game will freeze up and u have 2 restart the game. I like the fact that there's an ad once every 4 or more runs instead of getting in the way in the middle of gameplay. If the game doesn't freeze up on me when I'm playing 2 long I'll give it 5 stars. Edit: could use more music on this game. Feel like 3 or 4 tracks isn't enough.",

Anyone can develop stretch marks, although they tend to affect more women than men.\r\n\r\nStretch marks can be visible on body parts including the tummy, thighs, hips, breasts, upper arms, and lower back. The marks form in the middle layer of the skin; when there is a constant stretch, the layer tears, leaving stretch marks.\r\n\r\nStretch marks are usually a slightly red or purple shade, to begin with, fading with time to silvery white lines that may or may not disappear.\r\n\r\nStretch marks are common in certain circumstances:\r\n\r\nMany women experience stretch marks during pregnancy as the skin stretches in numerous ways to make room for the developing baby. This continual tugging and stretching can cause stretch marks.\r\nStretch marks sometimes appear when you rapidly gain or lose weight.
