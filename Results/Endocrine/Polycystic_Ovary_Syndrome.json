            "I was excited to use this app. It lets you track fsh, lh, and pdg if you buy those strips separate and have the app activated for it. I have used this for 3 months. The one cycle I did pdg it did not chart accurately. Two other cycles have been wasted as it wrongly shifted my predicted fertile period and ovulation way after both my hormone levels dropped. Tech support replied quickly and said it will be fixed in future update, which has not happened yet. Meanwhile, I wasted money on 2 kits now.",
            "Pearl claims to be helpful if you have abnormal cycles and PCOS. One thing I'm really disappointed about in this app is that if your cycle is longer than 30 days, you stop seeing your hormone results on the graph. Kind of defeats the purpose of measuring. They will provide the graph if asked, but this can take time and you may have missed peaks by waiting",
            "I love these tests and the app, but since the latest update it it doesn't want to open my camera and the timer didn't work.",
            "Incredibly disappointed, paid close to $60 on Amazon for the test kit and the freaking app doesn't work. Searched the website for customer service and found nothing except for a very unhelpful FAQ section.",

            "The app is a great way to understand my bodies needs based on hormones. I wish there were more \"check your cycle\" options as well as more resources for nutrition that can help etc. It also has a very \"cookie cutter\" user interface that takes away from the legitimacy of the information.",
            "Don't like that you have to pick a certain amount of days for your cycle, as mine is irregular. It repeats based on that number of days unless you change it. Was better pre-update for this reason. I used to use this to keep track of what day I was on, but now it's no longer useful for that purpose.",
            "Why didn't I have this all my life? I always knew my mood is the worst 10 days before the period for a day.. but this app explained so much more!! Suddenly so many things are clear, no more analysing 'why I feel so bad', it's all making sense now. I recommended it to all my female friends. Absolutely loving it.",
            "I LOVE this app. Even though it looks a bit outdated, the actual content is fantastic, haven't find anything else similar despite the multitude of period tracker apps out these. The one issue is the name - it's not a \"horoscope\", it's psychological and physiological predictions grounded in science. I have recommended this to so many friends. Wish it was updated to look more clean and modern, but end of the day I don't even care cause the content is so good. Highly recommend.",
            "Simply impressed so far. I've been using the app 2+ months now and doing research as well. I find the app and the daily reminders to be very helpful. I am not exactly regular but this is helping me to be more aware and also helping me identify the appropriate symptoms to help me know where I really am in my cycle. I was already able to figure out how many days off I thought I might be and it turned out I picked the correct new date so I wasn't surprised."

            "It's an OK app. I like the look and it is quite easy to use. The thing that is a deal breaker for me is an ovulation tracker. It said that I should ovulate on the 5th of Sep which was ok as a prediction (all my apps said the same). I've been doing the ovulation sticks and it turned out, that I ovulated on the 1st of Sep instead. Even tho I ticked surge & peak and positive ovulation test in this app, the ovulation day has not changed. It still shows the 5th. I'll be uninstalling this app.",
            "Was great until I got a new phone and EVERYTHNG I recorded got erased, even after restoring my account. Good thing I am using other apps in addition. Won't be using anymore, way too much data to reenter. May want to look into fixing this.",
            "You gotta deal with a publicity every time you are opening it. That aside everything work perfectly, very accurate and user friendly. I would still recommend using ovulation testing in case, especially if you are irregular",
            "The app is very informative and very accurate.after using this app in less than a year I have conceived twins.thanks Soo much for the app.but please size of the baby and pregnancy mode settings should have a section for twins too.",

        "title": "How to Remove an Ovarian Cyst",
        "description": "Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that sometimes form in or on the ovaries. They are especially common in women of child-bearing age, although they can occasionally happen in women who have gone through menopause. Usually, they are painless and harmless. Many people even have cysts that come and go during their cycle. Some cysts, though, can be painful or indicative of other problems. Learn to recognize the symptoms of an ovarian cyst, and work with your doctor to figure out the best treatment plan for you. While many cysts will eventually go away on their own, others may have to be removed surgically. Depending on how severe your cyst is, you may need either laparoscopic surgery or a more invasive surgery called laparotomy.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

        "description": "The primary sign of pregnancy is missing a menstrual period or two or more consecutive periods, but many women experience other symptoms of pregnancy before they miss a period.\r\n\r\nMissing a period does not always mean a woman is pregnant. Menstrual irregularities are common and can have a variety of causes, including taking birth control pills, conditions such as diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome, eating disorders, and certain medications. Women who miss a period should see their health care provider to find out whether they are pregnant or whether they have another health problem.\r\n\r\nPregnancy symptoms vary from woman to woman. A woman may experience every common symptom, just a few, or none at all.\r\n\r\nIn the first few weeks of pregnancy, various physical symptoms and new emotions arise. Although many women felt some anxiety during these early weeks, and some found it hard to believe it was really happening to them, there was also joy and excitement.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant physical symptoms affected people's feelings in the early weeks of pregnancy. Nausea and sometimes vomiting is well known as 'morning sickness', but these symptoms can happen all day, and can occasionally be very severe.\r\n\r\nAnother common symptom is feeling tired or run down. Some people are surprised to feel so exhausted. Others include getting a strange taste in your mouth, having tender breasts, feeling dizzy or faint, and abdominal cramps or twinges. To some people it felt a bit like premenstrual tension at first. But some women we talked to felt physically fine during the first few weeks, or noticed only minor changes.\r\n\r\nPregnancy is actually a pretty complicated process that has several steps. It all starts with sperm cells and an egg.\r\n\r\nSperm are microscopic cells that are made in testicles. Sperm mixes with other fluids to make semen (cum), which comes out of the penis during ejaculation. Millions and millions of sperm come out every time you ejaculate but it only takes 1 sperm cell to meet with an egg for pregnancy to happen.\r\n\r\nEggs live in ovaries, and the hormones that control your menstrual cycle cause a few eggs to mature every month. When your egg is mature, it means it's ready to be fertilized by a sperm cell. These hormones also make the lining of your uterus thick and spongy, which gets your body ready for pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway through your menstrual cycle, one mature egg leaves the ovary called ovulation  and travels through the fallopian tube towards your uterus.\r\n\r\nThe egg hangs out for about 12-24 hours, slowly moving through the fallopian tube, to see if any sperm are around.\r\n\r\nIf semen gets in the vagina, the sperm cells can swim up through the cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes, looking for an egg. They have up to 6 days to find an egg before they die.\r\n\r\nDownload this app and learn more about pregnancy symptoms & signs of pregnancy.",

I went from being able to enter 97.45 to now it only wants me to enter a temp of 34 to 43........that's not a temp of a living thing. Until now it's been great for tracking everything.",
            "Love this and have used it for years. Just downloaded the most recent update and the heart issue others have mentioned still isn't resolved. And also I am unable to add my temperature which is the most important for me. It is set to F but says I can only enter values between 34 and 42.",
            "Loving this app so far. Has great articles, very user friendly and it's been nice keeping track of everything in general, but certainly while trying to conceive. I did notice that there was a recent update, lovig some of the new options to choose from. But wondering why the hearts don't add to the calander anymore when you've marked intercourse occuring? Update - the hearts are back!",
            "I really like this app. But with the updates lately it hasn't been working so great for me. The BBT keeps giving me an error no matter what temperature I put in. And on the chart the hearts don't show up anymore. Really Loved the app before all the updates. Please fix the issues.",
            "I've been using this app for years now. Disappointed that the latest update erased all my past data logged. I've kept this app over the years for the sole purpose of being able to review past entries with medical staff. Now I no longer have the entries."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

            "I paid $19.99 and am extremely unsatisfied. I have already canceled and wasted $19.99. The only thing it allows you to do is log your food, water, and counts your steps. My Fitness Pal does all of this for free! Better Me literally sets you up with a plan, after you pay them initial money, you have to continue to pay them more money to get more access to the plan. I feel like I have been scammed.",
            "It is great app when you pay those $20. You get the meal plan on email, you get access to how to prepare many meals, etc. But, when I was asked to pay for diet plan there wasn't any info that it is a limited time subscription. Additionaly, after subscription ended I lost access to the app - totaly. Only screen I can see is the one that offers me different subscription options. So, you basicaly pay for email document with a diet plan and limited time to use the app.",
            "Good concept, but needs work. I like the hydration reminders, nice workout selection with subscription, but the tracking is severely limited. Food defaults to the same portion for every serving size (3.57oz) with no standards for basic items (like an egg) and you can't go back and add things the next day. Can't adjust fasting start time if you forget. Training suggestions pop up super late at night (like, 9pm) with no alternate timing options. Weekly reports don't include all tracked items.",
            "Doesn't provide the custom meal plan that it suggests from the personal preference questionnaire. There is only screen viewing. PDF access would be better for meal prep & exercise at the gym. I leave my phone in my locker so I don't loose it on the gym floor. This app is a bonufide gimmick. This type of plan can be found free in many versions on the internet. Subscription CANCELATION is proving to be a nightmare. I signed up 9 days ago & have been trying to cancel the renewal for 4days. Helping!",
            "So far so good. Glad not experiencing any real challenge with the app other than it freezing up or buffering during the workout. Will update as I experience more. Update - App did not live up to my expectations. Food diary list of options extremely limited. The plan started me out fasting, Wich is no big deal. However, it says I will be notified when to end the fast 16 hrs later no notice, 20 hrs later still no notice to end fasting. The workout/exercise plan did not record my activity."

Old sages have explained day regimens (dinacharya), night regimens (ratricharya), and seasonal regimens (ritucharya) to sustain a healthy life.

            "First of all, many Congratulations to the lead Dr Avantika for this great venture. Though the app works amazing without any technical glitches , the best thing about this is the *one of kind* recipies for a food junkie like me. 😋 As you won't gulp down the guilt with every bite if you follow the charts and varied satvik cusine. Another interesting features are Dincharya and diet plans. It's important to inform coming generations about the healthcare with the healing touch of Ayurveda and you are doing a superb job by bringing this here in smartphones 😍😘 Godspeed!!"

            "Good feature set, but pretty much useless for anything except tracking period and symptoms if you are not temping: even with clear cervical fluid patterns, it will not estimate when ovulation happened on a particular past month. Edit: thank you for your quick answer! Yes, I know cervical fluid is not enough information to compute the ovulation day, but I would expect a sort of estimate like \"based on your inputs, ovulation might have happened on CD x\".",
            "Have used it for years. Used it for 2 of my babies so far. It helps me know where I am in my cycle. I can compare my current cycles from cycles years ago. It all stays in the app for recording purposes.",
            "The app is suddenly not working for me... Got a networking issue in the app, but I can connect to the Web site directly. Not sure what went wrong.",
            "Please what's the problem with app network these days? Overall a very great app so far.",
            "What a terrible app. There's more screen space dedicated to premium pushing ads than the chart! It continiously tells me I might be pregnant, even in the middle of my period (and, as someone going through fertility treatment, it's made me cry twice because the ads push that I would be pregnant if I had just bought premium), it has no algorithm to adapt to cycles and is stuck on an insane 20 day cycle, and the UI hasn't been updated since the 90s."

            "My previous phone couldnt update this app so i was loving and enjoying an app that was at least 1 year behind, now that I am in the new decade with an updated phone, I hate this app. Since giving birth my period has been inconsistent, the app wont let me adjust my cycle or, you know, \"track my cycle\" accurately. It cannot compute postpartum bleeding. The older versions were awesome, easy to adjust cycles if needed, good articles, and tracked my pregnancy so well. The updates are awful.",
            "I've had this app for almost 2 years. But I am still not pregnant. No customer service! If you wish to contact them, they first collect too much of your data and personal information, and about device you are using, before they help you with anything, and that's just to give a response to a simple question.. Also, the projected periods in upcoming months are totally messed up! For some reason app shows 2 periods in 1 coming month.. I tried to fix it, but app doesn't let you do it. Disappointed..",
            "Deleting this app. Useless. No longer works. Have been trying to update my period date for a week, won't let me do anything. It seems that customer service has disappeared and no longer even replies to reviews left. Found a different app with better ratings."

But what happens when this most basic biological function becomes a battle?\r\n* For many women, getting pregnant does not take a lot of effort.

The most common is the stress we go through everyday life. As it is already known and proven by research, stress acts a major hindrance in a person’s fertility. It is estimated that one in six couples face difficulties in conceiving. \r\n\r\nThe stress arises due to various responsibilities from career, home, partner and other commitments.

But this ancient form of workout can be a great weapon in your arsenal.\r\n\r\nWhat Kinds Of Yoga Are Beneficial For Conception?\r\n\r\n* Yoga is all about how you do it and not how much.\r\n* Hatha yoga is considered to be very ideal for fertility as it involves slower and flowing movements.\r\n* The deep and slow breathing involved in this yoga calms your mind and allows for focus and concentration to set in.\r\n* The various holding poses called Asanas will help improve blood circulation as your mind reaches a state of peace.\r\n* While holding a certain pose, you have to imagine in your mind that a vital energy is flowing into your genital area.\r\n* These productive mind associations actually trigger the feeling of well-being and energy to the affected area.\r\n\r\nTips For Doing Yoga Poses For Fertility:\r\n\r\nYou need patience to practice Yoga and bring it to perfection. Along with Yoga asanas it is recommended to practice meditation, additionally. As Yoga asanas are exercises to the physical body, meditation is an exercise to mind. When both mind and body are balanced, body hormones will function well and then help maintain a healthy body. \r\n\r\nStudies have shown that mediation can literally change our brain cells. The negative thought pattern of infertility should be changed to ease the whole process. Ayurveda too is also proven beneficial along with Yoga.

I also have the wink thermometer, and I am upset that they no longer make it. That was another big plus of the app, how it automatically synchs the temperatures. However, I do still use kindara. It 100% helped me prevent pregnancy, then get pregnant with my son when we were ready. I just wish they would improve the Android version and also bring back the wink!",
            "I have just started using this a couple of weeks ago and really like it. It is making me pay attention and record important things that I didn't use to. However, and I don't know if it's just a glitch, since yesterday, does not allow me to record anything. The pages don't even load and I am having to record my info somewhere else so I don't loose it. Hope this is just a glitch and I can write a better review soon",
            "Just lost a cycle's worth of a custom track I accidentally clicked on delete. I thought that instead of marking \"done\" to the new (accidental) alteration, just going back it would revert back to it. It didn't and actually deleted all of it. So basically: there's no purpose to the \"Done\" button by the Custom edits. Also, I can't reorder my custom tracking fields at all, despite showing the three horizontal bars that usually mean things can be rearranged.",
            "I use kindara to track everything and to get pregnant. It works really well with me but I think it shouldn't move my period marker if I'm late. I updated to 4 stars because it reminded me of my coverline and how hard it is to move it or edit it. Also for editing the area of adding and removing items that you take or use.. it cuts off and you have to redo it and re-edit to make it fit which was super annoying for me that time. Also why does progesterone have a + and - sign?",
            "Love this app! The community feature is my favorite. I love getting to see other women's charts, it really helped me learn how to chart when I first started. This app offers every feature you'd ever need to track for achieving pregnancy or natural birth control! I also love that you can turn off predictions."

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

It allowed me to keep track of my period but also how I am feeling on the day and some symptoms on my period eg. acne, cramps and mood swings. I can also add additional notes for each day to keep track of additional information. On-top of that I can now keep track of my ovulation and my chance of pregnancy. I do wish it would notify me though about my ovulation. Apart from that PERFECT!! :))",
            "Great tracker! The period reminders are not working, however it's no biggie. Also, the period calculations up front are not working when you have your period for weeks, months then stops a month, etc. I know these events are hard to predict but I think it would be nice to like have the app track these unregular period days and then maybe next month remind us that we might get our period around that time again, in a different color maybe. Just a thought!",
            "This is a very cool app. I like the graphics, simple and handy. The other apps I used were so flowery and crowded and stuffed with decorations. This app is very easy to use and has every feature a woman needs, or anyone who has a long-time partner and wants to keep track of things. Cheers!",
            "I've been using this for a few months and I find it really easy to use! I'd recommend this if you need something to not only track the time of month you start menstruating but also symptoms and similar things. I tend to remember to track down my symptoms since it's on my phone.",
            "Still new on this app haven't experimented on it that much. It's been 2 months and some weeks since I started the Clover period tracker and so far I'm loving it especially with a busy schedule and life sometimes gets in the way I turn to forget my cycle so the reminders are great 👌😊"

            "I am surprised to note that there is an app that has been developed as if it were to be used in stone age. I recently changed my mobile device and hence got logged out of healthifyme.When i logged in again i lost all my data. I raised concern and was told that once i logout all my data will be lost!!!!!!. Grow up developers!!! There are n number of time i might have to logout. You want me to start from scratch everytime? I have lost data from March 2018 to October 2020. Will uninstall the app.",
            "I really like this app, especially if you subscribe, it will give you meal plan & you can adjust to your preference. However, at some point I find it difficult to tract everything in a single day. time consuming. Careful when you purchase the 1 month subscription, it will auto renew, so always remember to go to google play to cancel subscription to avoid money deduct automatically from your account.",
            "I had a really bad experience with this app. I had taken monthly membership of live studio. My membership got deactivated after 10 days for some reason. I had almost 10 classes left for the month. I reached to customer care. They just gave some copy paste reply and didn't resolve the problem. I waited for 3 days and then accepted that I lost my money for such a useless service. Don't waste money here there are better apps available.",
            "I don't know what actually happened with this app... Previously it was working good but after recent update, sometimes it doesn't count calories.. example if I'm walking and at 2000 steps if it's showing 200calories burnt so even after walking 5000 steps it'll show the same 200 calories burnt. I tried refreshing it, restarting app, even my phone.. but it doesn't work.",
            "I really liked the studio session but I personally felt that the smart plan is not at all useful and it's a waste of money. However the studio session is really really good. The coaches are very interactive, correct the posture immediately and give good motivation to push ourself"

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "Would rate 5 stars if this bug weren't terrible For some reason, the app always counts some random huge number as the length of one of the cycles shown in the report. For example,now the report shows I had a cycle from Jun 5th to Jul 3rd but it also says that it lasted 111 days!! Today i looked at the calendar: 3 of my cycles just disappeared, which obviously made one of them very long. I log all my cycles in the app, so i don't think this was a fault on my part.",
            "It was suprb app as I downloaded it but later to free space I had to uninstall it now i need this n its keep saying network error for least 2 weeks as other apps are working great N i can't even sign in or sign up. .it's frustrating please help me I need this to work",
            "The app is good especially with the features. My only concern is its start up, oftentimes it is so slow.",
            "I've been using this app for months and for some reason there are gaps in the data I entered. I logged my period last month and now it's not there in the app. I have recoed for Feb and May but none for the other months.",

            "This app has great potential. Greatinformation that I have been wanting but lacks in the intuitivness factor and also there is no option that I have seen to pause or switch when you are pregnant. Good start but a ways togo to get 5 stars. Change my mind!",
            "I tried the free version and it was good but I craved more detail in the daily descriptions. I found the free version a bit repetitive. The Pro version is great! I have been able to monitor my feelings, moods and general physical state and in a month I have gained insight into my monthly cycle that I haven't had before. Really great. I only wish the App didn't suggest you'll over-spend the whole month. I think people who are consumers might spend. There are other outlets/suggestions, surely. X",
            "I LOVE this app but given that I use it every single morning (for almost a year now) and it has one HUGE problem the pisses me of every single day, I can't give it a full 5 stars. But I'd love to if this problem could be solved with an update! The problem is this: Instead of buttons to navigate from the page you're looking at to the next one or previous day, it goes by swipe and it's SUPER sensitive and it resets where you are when you are reading. I loose my place every day and give up. Sucks.",
            "I love this app! This is the only app that gives you real insights into how your behavior and moods are affected by your hormone levels. The only problem is your can't change the length of the luteal phase so some of my predictions are off.",
            "I enjoyed this app, but after less than 3 months it changed many of the days and now has one 52 day cycle instead of two. It's completely useless if it changes past days / dates."

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "I haven't exercised in years this was just enough for me to complete without giving up. I was sweating and can feel it toning all my problem area's. I know that if i stick with it I'll see the results.",
            "Amazing! I haven't worked out in so long so this challenges me while having breaks in between workouts which helps me to keep going! They show you the video of how to do it, have music provided, and are short workouts that kick your butt! Definitely recommend having this app in your routine! 💪❤",
            "So far so good! I love being able to select my workout and schedule workouts. The timer during each rep helps me tremendously. Because I'm new to working out. The descriptions of how to do a move and how many sets is great. Plus a video that shows you what it should look like is dope!! Level 1 is perfect for someone extremely out of shape such as myself. I'm excited to work myself up to the a level 4 and see my results. Good luck on your journey 🤗",
            "Pro: I love how the app gives you an option on the difficulty level of the exercise and automatically transitions to the next move in the exercise. The videos are also helpful and there are descriptions to modify the exercise. Con: I paid $90 AUD and there's only 24 workouts. For the money paid, it would be nice if there are nutritional advice or recipes and add more workouts. Not a \"value-for-money\" app.",
            "It's so hard to find a workout app that scales intensity for beginners, but this one is perfect. Each exercise is just the right length so that when I think \"oh no I can't do any more\" I do one more and it's a rest period. I also want to say thank you for not flashing annoying UPGRADE TO PREMIUM ads all over. Most health and fitness apps want a $100/year subscription these days and that is insane. THANK YOU!"

            "Great app. I waited till after I was done with the 21 day challenge to review. I did the challenge everyday and I did this with 5 bottles of water and intermittent fasting as well. After the 3rd week I added 35 to 45 min of treadmill and very light lifting 3x a week. I've only been on the scale once. So far I've been feeling amazing no more bloating. My family has noticed my weight loss. I've lost 5 lbs. It's not much but it's a start. Love the app!",
            "I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ♡.",
            "The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw",
            "I've been using for a couple weeks and I really like how simple and easy this app is...gives me no excuse not to work out bc most workouts are just 10mins! I am doing the full body 28 day challenge and it's actually really enjoyable. I feel good after the work out and want to do at least one more. Really enjoyable women's fitness app. Not to much and not to little. Just right for this mom. 💃",
            "If your somebody who is having trouble during the pandemic and feeling a bit of bloating then download this app!! It amazing.

So greatly to have this app its definitely good for beginners TTC and needing a little help on tracking ovulation cycle.",

I take medication that does not always make checking cm easy so having then O tools on Premom have been great. I ovulated later in my cycle than I thought so I'm so happy to have them to rely on and not only my O tests since it tells you whether your test is low, high or peak. Thanks Premom😊",

I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.) Idk, this is on the road to bring a great app. I would recommend letting the users have full control to customize it.",

Would be nice to have a ML/oz, gram etc calculator. Thanks for the app as is however its really great. Best to your team. Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

            "I had a few glitches with this app, notably when casting to the tv. I like the routines but was dissatisfied that some of the workout classes you couldn't save to use again - apologies if you can, I couldn't work out how! The other issue I had is that like most other apps there is a lot of squat exercises, not good for me, and an alternative is often tricky to find. Sad that so much is only available to subscribers, I haven't renewed for the above reasons, and I'm not interested in the meal plan",
            "I like the classes, but feel sad about not having them available on the weekends. The workouts are good too, but I am still trying to figure out how to create a routine for the week / month, that is complete and balanced. I found this app is not very good at providing that. The previous app I had was very good at setting up a 3 month program and I did not have to figure out what to do everyday, plus I felt I was working towards a more clear and oriented goal.",
            "Great app! Changed my life :) got addicted to online workouts.. Good diversity, awsome trainers, you can choose the workout level and type easily. Highly recommended!!",
            "I've tried alot of apps to help motivate and hold me accountable and 8fit is the only one that has worked for ME! I love that it starts your work outs at the level your at. It has alarms, recipes, and I can log my daily work outs to hold myself accountable. I use the free version right now but will upgrade when I reach my first weight loss goal!",
            "I enjoy this app. It's good for keeping my workouts on a schedule and helps me stay motivated. I can track not just the guided workouts I've done through the app, but also the workouts I do elsewhere. I'm not even using the premium version, either. I likely will get it, though! The classes it offers look good, and being able to access recipes would be great."

All meal plans are intelligently created in order to eliminate food waste as much as possible.

            "Game-changer for me. I'm not a good cook and it's probably the only place I've found where ingredient quantities are just right in general (and expressed in metric units!). Also the instructions are easy to follow and timing fits well. I now eat more varied, grocery shopping is way easier and I waste less food.",
            "I am obsessed with this app! Here are the top reasons I love it: - It is so easy to use. - It is aesthetically pleasing. - It compiles a grocery list for you that you can add to. - The way that the recipe pages are laid out is GOLD. 👌 I don't have to scroll through a blog. I can click on three sections (utensils needed, ingredients needed, and instructions (with ingredients listed underneath so that I'm not having to click back and forth). - Etc.",
            "So far amazing. This is my first week using the app and I'm honestly just loving it. This app curbs my nasty habit of over shopping at the grocery store and yet still forgetting some essential items. I don't have to research recipes that fit into my Keto lifestyle, it's all layed out for me. Just click, and go. I'm honestly shocked at how easy it is to use and how incredibly helpful it is. This is not your turn of the mill list app or meal app. It's all here!",
            "Absolutely five stars. Easy interface, you add recipes to your plan and it automatically generates a categorized grocery list for you. Gone are the days of running around the grocery store grabbing useless stuff that goes to waste, and wasting money. I've been using this app for about 2 months and I'll never go back. I've been using the free version up until now, but I'm about to pay for the premium subscription because it truly is just that good. No, this is in no way an ad.",
            "This app has really helped me and my husband start to meal plan. I've tried to meal plan multiple times and just can't stick to it or it takes up too much time. Having the gluten free option definitely helps as well (celiac here) so thanks for including that! I've thought about going for the pro version but a yearly cost of about £50 is a bit much. I'd maybe consider a one off payment of that, or maybe if it was paying per meal bundle (since I'm assuming that's why it's a yearly payment)."

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one. Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

        "description": "Fertility Test Analyzer is the best fertility app to help you interpret both pregnancy and ovulation test strips by giving you the % of pigmentation. It provides you with fertility charts based on your hormone levels so you can pinpoint your fertile window and track your early pregnancy days. Fertility Test Analyzer helps you get pregnant, especially if you have PCOS or irregular periods when ordinary ovulation calendars and trackers are not so helpful. It also makes you save money! Now you can buy cheap test strips in bulk knowing that you will be confident about the results once and for all!\r\n\r\nFertility Test Analyzer reads pregnancy and ovulation test strips, interprets their results and shows them in an easy and understandable way. Be reassured when reading the pigmentation level of an ovulation test or seeing a very faint line on a pregnancy test. Find out that you are pregnant before a missed period using the most sensitive tests in combination with our app. Join other pregnancy success stories! Using our  unique computer vision algorithm, Fertility Test Analyzer recognizes the pigmentation trace present in the test pad and gives you your long awaited answer.\r\n\r\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\r\n✔ Read pregnancy and ovulation test strips without any doubts.\r\n✔ Detect ovulation based on your hormone levels.\r\n✔ Predict your fertile window.\r\n✔ Improve your chances of pregnancy by better timing intercourse.\r\n✔ Check on your pregnancy initial days following your hCG evolution with its fertility charts. \r\n✔ Access your data offline and review it when Internet access is not available.\r\n✔ Keep pictures of your tests safely saved in your mobile phone.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT LIMITATIONS\r\nFertility Test Analyzer transforms qualitative data,given by the pregnancy and ovulation test strips, into quantitative data (% pigmentation). The accuracy of the numeric value is affected by a number of factors, such as: test quality, how diluted the urine is, the quality of the camera used, your skills in taking a good picture and a correct lighting. Hence, numeric results obtained cannot be taken as exact values, only a laboratory can give those.\r\nUse at your own risk. Do not use to avoid pregnancy or anything where more accuracy would be required. Please consult your healthcare provider for any health concern.\r\n\r\nAUTHORS' NOTE\r\nThe time has come to say goodbye.\r\n\r\nOver the last years we created and give support to Fertility Test Analyzer in our spare time as part of a non-profit project. Our intention was to help women to reach their dream of become mothers, and we are happy to see that it has over 70k installations at the time.\r\nSadly we have to admit that we don't have the resources to keep up on new devices and therefore we have taken the decision of release the app to the public domain under a commercial free license. We expect other fertility apps to use this technology in the near future and we think that this is the best way we have to contribute to the well being of women with fertility difficulties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we won't be giving support or maintenance to the app anymore. If you are an Android developer with some free time and want to contribute (there are a couple of things with priority if you have a modern device), the source code is on https://gitlab.com/colnix/fta. Please make a pull request or create a brand new app of your own! The only legal requirement is that you have to use it for good, not for evil :)\r\n\r\nThank you for join us throughout this project and we hope to see you soon in another adventure.\r\n\r\nMaría and Pablo",

            "Total garbage when you're trying to check tests strips! I had a perfectly sharp image in the camera window multiple times and it kept telling me that it was a low quality image and couldn't detect the test line. It was easy to see with the naked eye even, I just wanted to save the image. I think this app needs perfect daylight, natural light to detect the lines. For the record, pregnancy tests are done first thing in the morning! For those of waking up early, that's impossible. Uninstalling.",
            "No matter what I did it couldn't even find the control line, outside, inside bright light, low light it didn't matter it never found the super dark control line and we are supposed to trust it to analyze the possibility faint results we are praying for? No. Thanks for nothing but frustration and a big let down.",
            "Should have believed all the other reviews. This app is junk. It does not pick up anything no matter what you do or how clear the image is even when it shows a visible control line in the window. Don't waste your time.",
            "Works fine when it works at all. Continue to have a very difficult time with the picture taking aspect. I understand it has to be specific to be accurate. But multiple times it has told me \"Control line not found\" but clearly marked exactly where the control line is.",
            "Takes MULTIPLE tried to capture picture. Also the test window is too far spaced and reads the pregnancy indent not the supposed second line. So give false positive reading"

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

Thousands of delicious keto recipes, calorie & macro tracker, exercise tracking, custom keto meal plans tailored for you and your goals, keto diet articles, & more low carb diet goodness.\r\n\r\nTotal Keto Diet was created by Tasteaholics.com, the top keto diet & low carb recipe resource, with the goal to make your keto diet easier and more achievable.\r\n\r\nKETO DIET APP & LOW CARB RECIPE FEATURES:\r\n\r\n• Thousands of Keto Recipes\r\n• Custom Keto Meal Plans - tailored to you\r\n• Exercise Tracking\r\n• Keto Calculator - get on track with your low carb diet\r\n• Macro Tracker - track your calories & macros every day - being on a low carb diet is easier than ever!\r\n• Truly Low Carb - our macro tracker includes total or net carbs to make your low carb diet even easier to follow.\r\n• Huge Food Database - hundreds of thousands of foods & tons of low carb recipes available for your keto macro tracker.\r\n• Favorites Section - so you can jump straight to the keto and low carb recipes you need.\r\n• Shopping List – add ingredients from keto recipes or your own ingredients.\r\n• Beginner’s Keto Diet Guide - to help you understand everything about the keto diet and get started with your keto diet immediately.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE KETO DIET?\r\n\r\nThe keto diet (also known as a ketogenic diet, low carb diet and LCHF diet) is a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Maintaining a low carb diet is great for weight loss. Moreover, according to an increasing number of studies, a low carb diet helps reduce risk factors for diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and more!\r\n\r\nWHY REDUCE CARBS ON A KETO DIET?\r\n\r\nWe’re beginning to understand that carbs in large quantities are more harmful than previously thought, while most fats are healthy & essential (the basis of a low carb diet).\r\n\r\nWhen you eat lots of carbs, your blood sugar is consistently elevated and, as a result, so is insulin. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.\r\n\r\nThis insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nA keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTHE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!\r\n\r\nThe nutritional landscape is changing.

Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.<br><br>This insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.<br><br>A keto diet can reverse these harmful effects &amp; restores insulin sensitivity.<br><br>THE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!<br><br>The nutritional landscape is changing.

            "I have had this app for about 4 months and it was so good at helping me track my cycle and understand what my symptoms are suggesting during my cycle. The advice it used to give about what foods are good to eat during specific times of my cycle was so helpful. But a few months on and I can no longer put my data in to track my symptoms. Really frustrating and disappointing. Seems like there is an error once you have used it for a certain amount of time. Not designed very well.",
            "It doesn't work. I wanted to love this app. But it's a joke for a paid app. I have to reinstall it constantly and the add symptoms button doesn't work forcing me to have to reinstall again. It's infuriating. I've read other reviews having the same problem and customer support recommended reinstalling. Over and over. That is ridiculous. This app is garbage. The content is great and I love the books but this app has too many bugs. Alissa needs to have it redesigned this is ruining her brand.",
            "I loved it until I didn't. The first month or two, it worked great. After that, it stopped letting me track my symptoms and make notes unless I was in my menstrual phase. So frustrating. I hope the bugs for this get fixed for Android users.",
            "Unfortunately the app is basically unusable. It worked okay for a month or two but now I cannot enter or track anything. I have reinstalled it many different times and it has not started working again. I love Alisa but she needs to hire someone to revamp this app, I believe it's detrimental to her brand in its current state.",
            "Been glitch from the start about a year ago and it just keeps getting worse. Too many bugs to call them features. The FREE app I've been using for a few years can track more and has never had a glitch. Apparently from other reviews this has been going on for ages - why aren't Flo fuxing it?!"

            "I believe this app has potential, though I suggest adding several things: * switching between imperial and metric units. This will make using the app a lot easier for people outside the US. * Adding an option to implement the replacements into the actual diet, so that the shopping list adjusts itself. * Being able to see the shopping list for multiple days ahead. I doubt that anyone feels like going to the grocery store every day",

            "Pretty good starter for a healthy diet habit. Effective weight loss for the first few weeks, probably shouldn't be continued for a long period of time. Simple and easy to implement. Diet effectiveness depends on body type so it would be wise not to take the numbers in the app seriously, such as 10lbs weight loss per week.",
            "After 6 days I lost 6 pounds so you may need to do it twice if you didn't lose weight in the first 3 days which is fine BECUASE 6 pounds in less than a week is alot! And I didn't even go exactly according to the diet coz on day 3,4,5 I ate snacks. And on day 2 I eat spaghetti with sausage for lunch 😅 but I exciesed each day and bruned 500 calories for 6 days and I lost weight in the end :) oh and if u really want it to work don't eat dinner on the 6th day eat like little snacks on 3 or 4 pm.",

            "The app it's self is the only thing I have issues with. They need work out a few kinks. I had some problems trying to cast to my TV. Also one of the workouts I did that was only 14 mins was some how recorded as 44 mins. So just little things. Apart from that, the instructors are amazing. Very knowledgeable people doing what they love it seems like. It's entertaining and encouraging 😁 I would recommend",
            "This app is awesome! They have a whole range of different types of workouts from low to high impact. Cardio, toning, endurance, strength and great stretching videos. Everyone and anyone can do this app, even people with injuries. You can choose from quick or longer workouts. I highly recommend joining, they have so much to offer for free and there is also a membership option. Only thing I'm disappointed in is that it doesnt sync with fitbit app. But regardless, this app is a must for sure!",
            "This is one of the first fitness apps I've used that actually has challenging workouts for myself plus a ton of free content. I love how there is an 'ongoing' workout plan so you don't have to figure out what to do next after your '4 or 6 week' plan ends. It also seems like there is new videos being uploaded daily so I'm looking forward to see if I get any repeats in my weekly workout plan. Overall I think this is definitely one of the best free fitness apps out there.",
            "Love this app, have been using it for a long time. But there are a few major design flaws that should have been fixed by now. Flaw #1: If you choose 12 week plan and later decide you want to extend, it resets everything (ie. It says you are on week 1 and keeps none of your past progress). #2 If you choose the \"Ongoing\" plan, you can't plan past 12 weeks. Once you hit 12 weeks, it just adds on one week at a time making it impossible to plan past the current week. Super annoying. Need to fix ASAP",
            "So far so great! The workouts are timed perfectly just the right amount to get you the desired result and you can always do another if one is too short. Secondly, the instructors know what they are about and motivate you so that you dont want to stop. A much better way to workout as your calories loss is right in front of you and your heart rate is calculated as well. Loving it!👍👍💯"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Tbh i don't think this is any shape or form good info to give to people, your hardly eating nothing, i can imagine the people have lost so much weight due to the fact that they have lost muscle too, which isn't good! Best just download a macro app, at least then you wont have to starve your self, and do it safely.",

I don't see this getting fixed. Sadly, the app hasnt been updated in over two years.",

For me I'd need daughter roles, boss lady role, and my wife, but it's been very helpful for me already, just limiting that you can only track one person's cycle.",

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

Waste of money - 6 months on the program, payment upfront - cumulative weight loss 3kg - could have lost a lot more on my own without spending the inordinate amount of cash. Don't waste your time or effort - not worth it.",
            "Hey team, This app is broke, i put in my details as 20yrs old, 5'8 , 53 kg and target weight as 60kg. It said i fall in Ideal weight category and instead of showing weight gain plans it was recommending me weight loss plans! To cross verify i put in my current weight as 40kg and to my surprise it was still saying i fall in ideal weight category. Either your app doesn't has any weight gain plans or it is simply broke. Kindly look forward to this.",
            "Although I started my journey with Truweight hardly a month ago yet I could achieve a remarkable reduction and stability in my blood sugar levels from the region of 180-250 to a level between 105-130. This coupled with a weight loss of 1kg is very important for me. And what is most important is that it has been achieved not by eating less but by eating right. I am thankful to my coach for guiding me through.",
            "Wow 👏 😮 It's like if all of your videos are superheroes. My weight is slowly but surely getting less. Thank you for this app. I wonder how these industries are fooling us well I am on day 2. I 💘😻love the app. Although where is the motivation tab?",

            "Weight is not losing. But it is a good app. It have also nice features in it. Nice voice and nice explanation. I also recommend that you this app for exercise planning. At last I want to tell you this app is very nice please download it and do exercise at home regularly and stay fit. I also thank all those who make this app. This app is very helpful. Once again Thankyou all 🙏🙏😉😉",
            "I absolutely love it! First of all, you don't have to pay for keeping your body healthy like most off the other apps(I got no money). Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

            "If anyone has ever tried the Keto diet, it can be incredibly tough. Finding foods that are low and carbs and taste good was very difficult. I was so close to just stopping the diet because I literally hated almost everything I was eating. Then, it clicked, I bet someone out there had these same thoughts. After looking around I finally found this cookbook. My goodness, this one is a life saver. It has a plethora of different recipes that use SIMPLE ingredients.",
            "Love love love this app. Best one I've come across so far. Every recipe is so easy to follow and that says a lot because I never step foot in the kitchen.. until I started Keto. This app gave me motivation to stick with it. This app has made cooking fun!! AND EASY!",
            "With this app I will have the capacity to cook genuine nourishment amid occupied occasions as opposed to being enticed to get pre-bundled or remove sustenances. I have seen numerous keto apps with such huge numbers of extraordinary fixings that most home cooks don't have. There is nothing more baffling than purchasing heaps of flavors that may be utilized for a solitary formula that I may never make again. The app is extremely efficient and it's extremely simple to discover what you need to cook"

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

I would expect more positive messages like \"it's okay, yo can try again tomorrow\". Apart from that, I think the app is fairly good especially considering it's free. One issue I have is that I cannot turn off the app music to switch, for example, to spotify. The background music from the app is very repetitive and I'd love to switch to one of my playlists. All in all, great app.",
            "This app is fairly good. However \"a beautiful body has never been easy\" quote after push exit from an exercise? Completely misleading, negative, and not body positive at all. I am confident, and have a fairly strong and lean figure, but this is just so offensive. No one needs to second guess if there body is beautiful while realizing they dont have time to workout. They dont need to ask themselves if skipping a workout will make them less attractive. This is toxic. Correct it immediately",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app 💗💗💗 However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

There are some good reviews about doctors as well. it is really helpful for us to take expert opinion for smaller ailments which doesn't require doctor's visit. However they should improve the speed for sharing Blood test reports. I got my report quickly only after escalation.",
            "Their service is horrible. Their app is full of bugs. Multiple times they haven't been able to honor their test appointments. And multiples times I had to go to their desktop website to do transactions. And to top it all they don't have any meaningful customer service. I will delete this app now. Just waste of space and source of frustration without adding any real value",
            "Fraud medical app. Please don't download it. I consulted a neurologist from practo. He gave me a prescription in PDF format. And I downloaded it. But after few days I lost the PDF file so logged in to practo to download the pdf file again. But when I logged in I found all my medical history was cleared even the prescription was not available.",
            "I loved this app. Consultation and medicines available in convinience of your house. In case of any query or doubt, just leaving a message in chat for the doc works. I had a smooth experience, would highly recommend others.",
            "Worst experience,I tried 3 times to get appointment. 3 times get cancelled saying doctor not available. In first case it self they could have mentioned slot unavailable instead of doing all this. CS team response also weired saying sometimes mistakes happen after numerous checks."

Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! 🙂",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! 👍",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high rating😂 Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

Hope this is figured out soon, cause now my streaks are gone 😒 Uhh I reinstalled the app cause I needed to make room for something else at the moment, and I'm trying to get it back on my phone, and it's telling me my device is not supported??? (This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest! This is so annoying!!!"

            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

        "description": "The primary sign of pregnancy is missing a menstrual period or two or more consecutive periods, but many women experience other symptoms of pregnancy before they miss a period.\r\n\r\nMissing a period does not always mean a woman is pregnant. Menstrual irregularities are common and can have a variety of causes, including taking birth control pills, conditions such as diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome, eating disorders, and certain medications. Women who miss a period should see their health care provider to find out whether they are pregnant or whether they have another health problem.\r\n\r\nPregnancy symptoms vary from woman to woman. A woman may experience every common symptom, just a few, or none at all. Some signs of early pregnancy include:\r\n\r\nSlight bleeding. One study shows as many as 25% of pregnant women experience slight bleeding or spotting that is lighter in color than normal menstrual blood. This typically occurs at the time of implantation of the fertilized egg (about 6 to 12 days after conception) but is common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\r\nTender, swollen breasts or nipples. Women may notice this symptom as early as 1 to 2 weeks after conception. Hormonal changes can make the breasts sore or even tingly. The breasts feel fuller or heavier as well\r\nFatigue. Many women feel more tired early in pregnancy because their bodies are producing more of a hormone called progesterone, which helps maintain the pregnancy and encourages the growth of milk-producing glands in the breasts. In addition, during pregnancy the body pumps more blood to carry nutrients to the fetus. Pregnant women may notice fatigue as early as 1 week after conception.\r\nHeadaches. The sudden rise of hormones may trigger headaches early in pregnancy.\r\nNausea and/or vomiting. This symptom can start anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks after conception and can continue throughout pregnancy. Commonly referred to as \"morning sickness,\" it can actually occur at any time during the day\r\nFood cravings or aversions. Sudden cravings or developing a dislike of favorite foods are both common throughout pregnancy. A food craving or aversion can last the entire pregnancy or vary throughout this period\r\nMood swings. Hormonal changes during pregnancy often cause sharp mood swings. These can occur as early as a few weeks after conception.\r\nFrequent urination. The need to empty the bladder more often is common throughout pregnancy. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, the body produces a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases blood flow to the pelvic region, causing women to have to urinate more often.\r\n\r\nMany of these symptoms can also be signs of other conditions, the result of changing birth control pills, or effects of stress, so they do not always mean that a woman is pregnant. Women should see their health care provider if they suspect they are pregnant.",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Question: is it possible to include in the options menu the ability to move the controller position to the player's liking? The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error.

            "Useless to install. There are not include at least 1 week trail period. It should pay before you start and before that they collect all detail about you. So if you check this app, after install and go to app settings and give no internet acceas and then try the app. But you have to pay before using it.",
            "Shouldve given an option for a 3 or 7 day trial. I subscribe and accidently chosen the 1 year plan which cost sgd44. 90 and i cant get a refund. If theres a trial. People should be charged oncd the trial end. People also should be able to see how this app works. Really disappointed. App sucks and no refund, at least give back half of the payment. Its sgd44. 90. And im not going to use the app. 👎🏼",
            "Downloaded it, and what rubbish. The workout is a joke. I paid 11euro and won't be using it at all. subscription cancelled automatically.",
            "I love it. The only thing I wish got updated/ fixed is that when I do extra workouts, I wish it would count/record it & that It doesnt record the work outs I do after 12am. Sometimes i only have time to work 11p-1a. But besides that I feel motivated,& since its split in 7min-12mins, I dont feel like it takes up my day or that Im really doing much. I feel like I have so much more energy. I highly recommend fit coach, especially if you are starting to get in shape(that's where I am at)",
            "This app is terrible. I made the mistake of buying into this before checking it out and I cant get a refund. There is no support for the exercises and the menu options have no proteins at all so unless you are a vegetarian this is terrible. I had my data exported to me and it all says \"none\" even though I entered all my info. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage. Im out $30 and learned a valuable lessen to learn more before investing. This app doesn't even deserve 1 star!!!"

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "Overall, I like this app. I just have a couple suggestions to make. -Add a trash feature, so that you still have some time to get a deleted picture back in case you accidentally delete something or change your mind. -Add a slider to the video playback. With really long videos, it's annoying to have to watch the entire thing through to get to certain parts, even with the fast-forward.",
            "This app is great! There's not that many ads, there's the right amount of tools to make wonderful drawings! It can be a little confusing at first but you'll soon get used to it! The only problem I have is, you have to have a membership to rearrange art order in your gallery?? I know they need to make some money somehow but... That just seems ridiculous and unnecessary, but other then that it's great!",
            "I need help, like when I was coloring the drawing that I just finished, suddenly it disappears, i was very scared of what just happened, i think I can redo it but I clicked on the redo button for like 1000 times it still doesn't give me back my drawing. I'm very anxious after what just happened. So can someone please help me out with this, please...😰😰😰😰",
            "This is byfar one of the best and very intuitive drawing app, I can work faster using Ibis compared to when I'm working with another drawing app. Stabilizer works great, doesn't stabilize too much, although I'd rather have the heavy stabilizer as optional because sometimes I need it too. Or at least there's more curved or flex ruler.",
            "I love this app and I would recommend but you have to be aware of lower battery and deleting this app. But there are so many cool things you can do. I use this all the time. It's easy, fun and free only, you have to watch an add before using all brushes. This is good quality and needs no WiFi."

I want to continue playing, but im getting over it real quick with the constant shut offs.",

However, recently I have played for about 5 minutes and then get kicked off and it loses everything I did in that 5 minutes. Maybe its just me but if not I hope that can be fixed and if so, it deserves 5 stars Edit: Have had response really quickly, deserves 5 stars! Thank you...problem solved I think it was just me",

            "This is an amazing game with awesome graphics and equally great gameplay. I just started the game about a week ago, and it ran fine. Yesterday it crashed a few times and was kind of annoying, but I forgot about it. Now, the game KEEPS crashing as soon as I hit the X for the first pack thing it shows you. I simply cannot get into the game and it is SO frustrating. Please fix it Ludia, because I know it's not my computer.",
            "The games nice. It's just that when I watch the ads that allow you to skips some time, it crashes on me. The ads completely stop working and the screen sometimes turns black. If you wait long enough the game kicks you out. Please fix this glitch. I wanted to skip sometime to quickly get my dinosaur. Last thing, anyone reading this, try to avoid the ads as they might crash on you. I have a S9 so it's weird how the game is crashing on me."

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats £7 a month, over £80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

I have a serious issue with one of your users harrassing/bulling me. I would love for her to leave the app or just at least not be able to find me.",

I still have depression, so I don't necessarily want to remove it from diagnoses, but I think I'll have to just so I can get the information I actually need.",
            "This app is overrun with spam, fake accounts, and people trying to scam others. There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home. You might even encounter the tiger king on your adventure (a superior evolution of the natural tiger), who has been spotted in the forest for the first time in centuries!  \r\n\r\nGROUNDBREAKING 3D GRAPHICS\r\n\r\nExperience never before seen 3D graphics quality in a wildlife simulation MMO, with dynamic lighting and time of day cycles which bring the virtual world to life!

I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "I have played this game for 6 years now (even though I have had to start from the start again due to getting a new device) and I think it's just a great game over all it's always got something new for you and it never gets repetitive! (Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "I really really enjoyed the exercise. Although im almost fainting but it was worth it. Im feeling pains in my joints.😂. I also love the water tracker app. I sometimes go a day without drinking water but with this app, im pretty sure im gonna drink a lot of water and stay hydrated. Hopefully i won't have much migraines. Weldone",
            "The app is incredible. I have completed 60 days and now I have started again from beginning. I recommend this app for all those who are above and below age 18. Though my height haven't increased yet I do this daily because exercising everyday is good for health. I hope that my height would increase some day as it depends on each one's body hormones. I have some suggestions for your app. You could add some yogas, some music, the tips of the process of inhalation & exhalation in every exercise. 😘",
            "It is a nice app . I think I can increase my height with this app .It have lot many exercises without any equipment, wow 😍 and have a planned diet and sleep tracker too . It's very helpful app. But the reason of giving it 4 stars is that in diet ,it includes lot many non veg things which I hate 😠😡 actually. You should ask this thing in introduction before planning when you ask about age ,height, etc. It will be better if you do this change. Plzz ,accept my request and do make change.",
            "Amazing i think it is going to be a good trainer and animated images and videos are also given in it. It not only tells about exercise but also about nutrition plus sleep and every exercises are increase and daily new tips of nutrition is also given with it. I think it will increase my height and the further after2 months i will post about it but i liked the app very much😘😘",
            "It's great experience to show how much you can stretch and get height this is my second day training I've grown only just a tiny bit I think but I'm getting their confidencre guys never give up or don't believe always believe in your self. I think this is a helpful review for other people to understand what to do and in all workout apps too."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

Do not install this game. I only gave it one star for the amazing clothes and characters I loved that!😁😍☺",
            "First, the game is good, I have played it for over a year, has many beautiful clothes but it's have lots of beautiful clothes is nees to much Zem to buy. Second, the game is so LAG when I started playing and go to world( it's made me impatient of this games 😡). Now it's make my phone Lag like in the game when I want to go out. I can't Message with anyone after playing this game. Third, sometimes I turn the circle and I got high money or a Zem and I can't watch ad to get double. That's all🙄!",
            "If u ask me why i put three stars it bcuz: 1. The game start to lag when i use it for long time or entering the world sometimes. 2. When i was abt to turn on camera and do video in world, the game completely shut off then i need to re record again at sec time when i open the game for sec times 3. It sometimes froze for a long time and i need to re open again Pls fix it, its really annoyed me and sometimes my phone get crashed cuz of this :(",
            "GLITCH ALERT! Please fix the headwear glitches. All the items I bought from the creators were perfectly fine and fit for my avatar's head until the newest update where you can change your body type. All the headwears are now either oversized or misplaced (not worn over the avatar's head). Please fix the glitch! We will wait for the new update."

            "such a good game really good and i really love it and it really easy when u get the hang of it and u get the hang of it quickly so i recommend installing it and remember the point is to have fun so enjoy the game and the girl in the game buys the napkin booster for u so u get it for free if u don't have enough coins and they have some tasks to complete so engoy the game and remember to always have fun. :)",

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

I recognize that people who support the game more via purchases deserve to win, but I just wish Bandai could make the brackets more even (i.e. by player level) instead of totally random",

My internet connection is fine (even my mobile data), I still can play other games. But this game is not letting me do so now. It's frustrating. Please fix it ASAP! Also, the game closes forcefully after I try to reconnect a few times. I feel like I'm giving up this game soon IF it still don't fix it.",

It settings,it is showed that FB Lite's language is my phone's language. Another problem is it's network speed. It uses less data, this is good enough. But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",
            "My opinion about FB lite :- Mobile useres think that LITE is for only common smartphone and for those useres who have poor network. Now I am using Samsung Galaxy tripple camera phone. I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",
            "The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",
            "Good but still some bugs. Not possible to save any searches in Marketplace. Since update the search option in Marketplace doesn't work properly. When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

But they keep changing it in ways that actually degrade the customer experience. Click the \"immerse\" button and the wheel spins perpetually. Try the help button and the same thing happens. They are turning what was a good hammer -- a simple, useful tool -- into a bloated, mediocre multitool that does everything -- badly.",

I was very disappointed with this feature otherwise I found this to be optimal language app compared to other options and I tried several .",
            "Very easy to use app . A very good app . Tons and tons of languages to learn from here . Most important , it is free . Very user friendly app and inexpensive to use on . Highly recommend. Now I know 12 languages but I recommend more click to learn languages pages . ( No typing ) to be exact . A very good way to learn languages .",
            "I could not think of one fault about this app. It is fantastic! So far, I've not had any problems and I've had the app for almost a month now. It is a great way to practice French in the holidays, when I'm not at school as my teachers can set class courses. I've also started learning Italian independently and all the FREE features have definitely helped. You can do so so much and I just wish I could write a longer review because MEMRISE IS INCREDIBLE!

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

So be careful folks to become victim. stay safe!",

And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",

Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "This is my best game on my phone. It'll be so good in the future also. It's not a bad game at all to. The graphics are perfect, a variety of characters, weapons are plentiful. One thing is that chests have an unplentif amount coins so maybe put a bit more coins in chests. Anyway good game, A plus graphics, a new Bat? I could never think of that!",
            "It's an fun and very addicting game, but I get matched with players 10 × my level. I'm on level 1 right now since I've just been introduced to it. I can't play the game due to the fact that I am dead in a matter of 15 - 20 seconds. My teammates will not give me a chance to grab the weapons either. Also, the items are a bit overpriced. I will redownload this game once these issues are resolved.",
            "When i subscribe to a weekly subscription, it's fail to showing me that i subscribe. I restore purchase many times, sometimes work and sometimes not working. I contact help disk and he bretend that my subscription is over, while i just took one day for 7 days !! It's a joke. There are alot of hackers whom I can't report!!! Believe or not, you cannot report them. He can kill as much he can, and no one can stop him. Please Don't waste your time and money, until they fix there issues!",
            "Game is very addicting but clearly pay-to-win, you cant play without it. My problem was that after I made a purchase, the game stopped loading. \"Something went wrong\" everytime I logged in. I tried to get a refund but no response. Very unhappy, I had high hopes seeing the advertisements but it's a RIP off!",
            "Great game I have about 9 character and they are just great this game is my most greatest game that I have. Just asome. Update, it's been about 2 years since I gotten a new character. It starts to get boring and I haven't played some time. Every timei get a golden crate, I always expect nothing out of it. Dont get your Hope's up. Look at me I got bored of a game that I loved for soooooo long and. It's starting to make me feel like why did I get this game. The point is the character percentage."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

I just go through it, and I understand the thoughts of God on my situations... It's helping me now rebuild my relationship with my fiancee... I'm happy",
            "I absolutely love this bible app. It has no ads. It's easy to read, offering lots of bible translations. You can make notes, highlights, and bookmarks easily. It also has a cool option where you can make inspirational pictures from any verse of your choice, and easy to download and share the image. I love this app! God bless 🙂",
            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

It loads for a second and takes you straight back to the main page. Waste of time. Also, every button you press will probably popup an add, 6 things you have to close out of, and then another add. I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",
            "Fun game but too many ads and popups about the VIP. If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",
            "Evreything is fun amazing and great. Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",

Also, while my internet connection is great, 50mbs+, the game is still laggy af. This might be something that is simple to resolve, however that is impossible too know as there is literally 0 customer support. Could have been a great game, but instead it sucks.",

I have a brand new phone (6Gig RAM) (125gig ROM) that should keep the battery for the whole day. But if I play this game. I have to plug in the power bank so I don't loose and power... Please help if it's a bug that's sucking my battery and heating my phone."

            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

At first I thought it was my headset but after I used 3 different headset I still have the same problem. When I used another phone with different series there was no problem with them. My phone is Samsung A21s.",
            "This used to be a fine app but out of nowhere it stopped uploading my songs, each song crashing at 60% mark while uploading. In spite of complaining to the developers several times they took no heed of my issue. I have lost more than 10 songs while uploading so far in spite of trying several first aid measures like clearing cache, reinstalling the app. This especially bothers me because I'm a VIP member. The developers don't seem to care much for their users. Use at your own risk.",

I even tried connecting with all the three headphones of mine which are wired, wireless n and Bluetooth enabled but the experience, hasn't really changed it is completely audio less to me..",
            "Always loading, i dont know why. I' ve been recomend many time as a PartyGuru, i have a lot of covered song, everyday i do collab and daily task. 4,000 fallowers, level of Partyroom. But still no aproval on my recomendation. While the others, i saw always on private no to much collab and covered. But you give the V tag as virified Singer. How is it possible. And for the popular list.. I dont understand why, some users are still no stage name,only Id's, have 6 gift only totaly newby in Starmaker",
            "Dear starmaker team, I am here to tell u about the issue regarding song post.So there is an issue whenever I post the song that I am not able to post any of the song.Even If I try to post them the system is saying \"failed to post\",so please try to get my difficulty.

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications 😶I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand 😐 cause of the translator. Please fix these issues 🙂",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "They actually did a pretty good job of adapting it to the smaller screen on the phone. The puzzle is done in sections. You can choose the number of pieces, turn rotation on or off and change the scale. I LOVE the background music by Ruslan Gumbatov! There are daily puzzles and missions but I don't bother with those, I play it to relax, not to collect rewards.",
            "I've loved this app for a long time now and it's one of the few that I even bought! **Edit**Oct 17 (dropped to 3 stars) I'm disappointed in the new layout of the daily and My Puzzle packs. I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",
            "Your app has sucked since the beginning of september, cant play daily puzzle. Fix it. Update new fix didn't work. Still can't play daily puzzle. Game freezes when you try. You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle. And now i lost all puzzles i had bought"

An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

Lastly, sending a file is such a good feature of the app that also should be added to the main app, but please improve it by retaining the actual file name of the files we send instead of changing it to randomly generated name and numbers.

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",

            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

            "Awful and flat out wrong advice. For first month it says to stay away from all seafood in one paragraph and then tells you to eat tinned tuna in another paragraph in the same article..... so it's conflicting AND wrong . You should avoid ALL tuna especially canned, but low mercury seafood is very beneficial.   Was hoping for more than pictures of badly written articles that I have to awkwardly move around the screen to read the whole thing.  One reason I was looking for a preg diet app was so I might not have to keep searching sites for what fish are and aren't acceptable among other things.  Seeing how non specific the food suggestions were just for the first trimester I am guessing this one won't show me the specifics I want in general.",
            "The app is good, but u will get these information on internet as well.... but if the app can guide u the exact food diet day by day.... like in 1st month to get more folate rich food app suggest like oranges, beans, eggs etc... but if if it give a diet chart like eat 2 oranges 1 egg etc on day 1, and some other fruit / vegetable in day 2 ... it will help the app user to make a balance diet... instead they eat all with out any control... hope to see some kind of update soon...

I understand that app developers want money, but not everyone can afford to put money out on a game. That being said, I do enjoy playing the app and reading the stories.",

It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",

I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",

Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"🙈🙉🙊"

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>WHY USE WHATSAPP:<br><br>• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone&#39;s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don&#39;t have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.<br><br>• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they&#39;re in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone&#39;s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan&#39;s voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can&#39;t access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).<br><br>• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.<br><br>• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer&#39;s browser.<br><br>• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There&#39;s no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*<br><br>• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone&#39;s existing address book.<br><br>• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you&#39;re always logged in so you don&#39;t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you&#39;re logged in or logged out.<br><br>• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there&#39;s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.<br><br>• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.<br><br>• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!<br><br>*Data charges may apply.

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Block craft is an amazing game! I only see a few problems. When I watch a add for more blocks it does not give me my prize.Please try to fix this! Also I would like to add a friends list so you could vistit your friends village. Besides that it is a really exfun game! Also can you buy things with your coins? That would be very helpful! I dont have any gems. One more thing. It gets pretty upseting when you run out of blocks. Its best if you don't level up. You really should get this game!",
            "Well Personly this game is AMAZING and you can build WHATEVER YOU WANT! So i recomend to play this game and Going to the build button on the right and clicking it, it gives you many different options when you level up you'll see more buildings and so you can build yourself your own personal house and stuff so i hope you have fun playing this game!",
            "Block Craft 3D is a nice game. You could get ideas from other's villages. You could buy pets, doors 🚪, and some others. But please 1 tiny thing. Can you fix the credit card issue. Cause I'm 10 and I don't have a credit card number. Way far from that, I love the game and Thank you!",
            "The game keeps closing for no reason and it's annoying when it gets stuck and when you are walking it makes you go through the building or through the wall. The cool part is that you don't have to build stairs. if you build a tall building and a single file building on that wall if you take out two blocks and stand under it and place on block under your avertar you will go right to the top of your building almost like an elevator",
            "Bad game You can't fly without paying, There is no survival mode, you can RUN OUT of blocks in creative mode, you have to wait 2 and a half hours to get them back. Speaking of blocks, you only get like 40 blocks for free. You can unlock a maximum of 20 blocks at a time for an unreasonable price. Bad game. Did I mention that you can't sneak?"

Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",

Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",

When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "This game is so fun, But there are always adds playing, but its worth it, this is a very fun game!! I hate the mask thing!!! It is a blast! But one thing I don't like is whenever I watch ads to earn better things I always loose to the other team, I tried both teams ballet and Hip hop, but I keep 💯 loosing. :) and dont tell me to stay safe,😡",
            "Very good app! I love how you can dress yourself and everything! The only problem is almost everything is locked. Makeup, clothes, dance moves, and more. That's how the game get boring.. I mean, what the point?! You can got to the doctor , spa , or take a selfie.. All you can really do is put makeup on, go to the gym, dress up, and do dance moves all over again! I do the ballet and I am getting tired of using the same dresses again.. (Turn off WiFi if too many ads)OTHERWISE, GOOD APP!!!!!!!",
            "I really used to like Coco games☺ until I was wanting to get the full version of the game , so I clicked on it and it was $9.99 .Really?!?!😑And almost everything costs money 😒😾Also when I was playing the game I was going against Hip-hop we got a higher number then they did but Hip-hop won!😡Are number was 3,444,589 and Hip-hop got 900😐 I would give it 5 stars if it did not lie.😠😡😡😡",
            "I would 100% recommend! Grate app. When I'm bored I love playing this game, it makes me love dance even more! Also amazing job to whoever made this game :) oh and, other people are saying there's to many adds? Maybe it is just their device. On my device (iPad) I don't get many. Thank you for taking the time to make this game!",
            "Okay I absolutely LOVE this game. I love how you can choose Hip Hop or Ballet. They are both amazing. I just wish that more things would be unlocked for free, or at least like \"Watch 5 videos to unlock!\" or something. But if you're look for something fun to play and pass time, ( It's especially useful during Covid-19) I reccomend this game."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

        "comments": [
            "4 stars only because planes can back into each other, bump into each other and sometimes go through each other depending on what planes and how many planes are in que. Also, making enough money to expand or upgrade is way too slow. The more I ply, the less I like this game. Getting what you need is really based on how much time you play the game at one time. Two stars now. This game is no longer fun to play. It's a chore.",
            "This game has improved it is still slow going unless you spend real dollars but now the bonus is that every 14 days you get one game dollar so there is the chance to advance even thought it is slow, it is now possible. Bad thing for me is now I am tempted to spend real funds to get to my goals quicker.",
            "I'm glad I didn't spend any money on the game for 2 reasons. 1)it really is not necessary to spend money if you're just a little patient. It does have advertising which you can watch instead of spending on the game. 2)I've got a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which is an above average smartphone in terms of its capabilities but the game frequently glitches necessitating closing & restarting which is a problem. Worse is that the developers don't acknowledge issues when reported. It's fun & addictive tho",
            "Since the latest update I'm not able to use my own comfort classes, only the free ones in every few hours. There's no possibility to use mine outside these free times. Also hawk planes often get stuck at the end of the runway and I have to close the game to make them go away. Takes an awful long time to collect coins.",
            "I LOVE this game. It is so involved and there is so much going on that once you level up a few times and you've got say 3 ore more planes and a couple of helicopters, you can literally stay busy constantly collecting passengers, money, exp. points etc...... that you can actually \"play\" the game for hours and your eyes and fingers never leave the screen. The special collections are so cool!! The only thing I don't like about it is a cost a lot of coins to upgrade buildings, buy aircraft etc."

Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

            "I've used Phonto for some time now and I can say that it is a fantastic little app for adding text to images. It's easy to use and remarkably powerful. Apart from changing size, position, font and colour, it even allows you to curve text, add a background and make it see-through. The ads are not intrusive. I've even used it for professional design work. With so many apps out there, you often don't know what to download. This one is a genuinely good product; I can fully recommend it.",
            "This app is personally great, i use it to make personal pins for pintrest. Just to give young teens advice. This app was perfect for adding words on top of pictures, and creating edits. But recently, the updated the app. I haven't been on it in probably a month so i decided to go back on. And it's impossible to save your projects. I had to take a screen shot n crop it on picsart. When before, you could just download it straight to you files. This app needs to be re-updated, But it's great still.",
            "I have been having some problems with this app. Don't get me wrong is great to use in many ways. But my problem is that I have some issues when iam trying to add a phont to my text it always kicks me out of the app and usually says that the app is not qor kiti ing correctly or something. Wich is why iam giving it a 3 stars. Idk why it does this, but I dont think this happens to everybody. But PLEASE PLEASE fix this!I haven't been able to use it for a while!!",
            "For the past 4 or 5 years, I've been using this app for my text-on-photo uses and it's been fine UP UNTIL THE LATEST UPDATE, where I can no longer save an image after I'm done. The save option isn't working no matter how many times you press it. Also, the display has gone completely whack after the latest update; I use a chromebook so I know it still shows up in the smartphone format, but the display was completely fine & functional before & I could see everything UNTIL NOW. Please fix this!!",
            "Sucks compared to iOS options. I found this app because of a YouTube tutorial. The options that it showed were great for what I needed it for. I paid for this app to discover that it is seriously lacking compared to what I saw. I even looked on my iPad and the options there still weren't what I needed. It will suffice for somethings for the $2 I paid. All I need are better shape options.. You would think that the app would be about the same across platforms."

            "One of the Best apps for chatting and texting. I got a lot of my old friend together because of discord. The only thing that needs fixing is The Voice Calls, this happens to me sometimes. I will be in a voice chat for a few minutes, or hours. Suddenly, it will stop transmitting my Voice. Other times. It will kick me out of the call completely, but discord is great overran. And it usually is ok with calls!",
            "Oh my god this update is awesome! It even removed the bug for which I put a 2 star rating. I'm really sorry developers I didn't tell you the problem, I didn't see your reply! I kept getting kicked out of Discord after talking to some friends of mine and this happened quite often. But now downloading it after a long time it seems to have been gone! You did a great job, keep it up!! This app will be a huge success :))))",
            "Very convenient for finding large communities around any subject. I love being able to talk with my friends in a small group chat, or in a large server with fun bots. The premium features are certainly worth it for anyone that spends a majority of their time within the app. However, all premium features are a monthly, or yearly payment. This is not very convenient for those who don't have a steady source of income. There should be an option to get minimum parts of premium for a single payment.",
            "Most of the times it doesn't work without headphones, however if I use it in another smartphone it does work. Something that I've experienced is that while you're in a call, it mutes or something like that, so I have to get out of the call and get in again, this \"mute\" happens while I'm not touching the phone and quitting the call is the only solution i've found",
            "Hello. Whenever I have discord open (browser or app), I completely lag out of games and my discord client, and it causes my web browser to stop responding. Without discord open, I never experience lag. Also, while in both browser or app, I'll suddenly be completely unable to speak in discord, but can hear everything that other people are saying. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm dying for a fix. I love discord, but it's been basically unusable for the last couple weeks."

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ❤",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! 😀",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

I have been using keep clean a lot, and it's changed, because now there's more ads than usual. Other than that keep clean is a great app, except for the inconvenience part of it, that's why I only gave four stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐❌",

Im dissapointed because it should keep your phone clean and safe but shows you adds for sketchy or dangerous websites like wish or dating apps. Kind of retorical if you ask me. I will update my review soon hopefully for the better.",

Secondly, the presented screen is small, which is quite disturbing and disappointing. And sending of messages is so difficult and different. Besides, checking infos, links are quite difficult. I am not able to see the participants in a meeting. In short, not so user-friendly. Please fix this and update to previous version. The previous version was much better. Thank you.",
            "The former version of this was better. Ever since my google meet updated, it did not allowed to me join peacefully. It just kept saying either \"Failed to join the meeting\" or \"Cannot connect you to a video call\". It really irritates me, in a way that I'am the President of our class and it's very humilliating for me not to attend. I really HATE the new version. It works on my other relatives phone, but I don't have the chance to ask them to lend me their phone even 'cause they are using it.",
            "After the integration of meet and Gmail app, I can't adjust the volume of the meeting. Even if I click the volume button and move the level to mininum, it stays the same. Please fix this. Seems like this is happening to my specific device model. Edit: After the latest update, it's working fine. Still the 3 star to bring back the old UI.",
            "The recent update is worst!.. Trust me, I am not able to handle this new version of Google meet. I was struggling to find where the chat section was and from where to send messages. I have to zoom each and every thing presented on the screen. The screen looks too small. Once you go in the chat section,you are not able to see the screen. The old version is way better than the new version. Please bring back the old version. Please!",
            "The latest version is the worst and it's a shame considering the app was already great. Typing a message is very frustrating with all the names entering and leaving the meeting appearing in front of the message, this could be solved by putting this feature in the top instead, sometimes your message hides behind the keyboard. This version also doesn't allow to see the chat at the same time as the meeting. Please comeback with the older version and we will all pretend this version never happened."
