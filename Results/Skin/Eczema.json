I have studied my own disease for all of my adult life, and all any app gives you is atopic dermatitis questions. Instead of \"in the last week...\" ask \"in the last month, 6 months, a year...\". And please add a sectuon on other symptoms because atopic eczema follows a trinity. With atopic comes hay fever and asthma. I have atopic dishydrotic eczema with asthma.

I had signed up on my old phone (as it said do this so you don't loose anything when you change phones) which is now broken  now I have my new phone, but theres no Sign-in or restore and no easily accessible FAQ. please point me in the right direction or kindly tell me how to restore onto new phone",

The fact this app just lets you take photos instead of uploading them for comparison is stupid. There are 7 types of eczema and not all types remain presentnon an adults body. Please research these types and add them to your app. Otherwise this app is a waste of time. I wanted to use it to show my dermatologist the outbreaks, but nevermind now."

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

By using iControl Eczema, you and / or your child would be able to assess your eczema on a daily basis and take photos of the affected skin areas. Monitoring your eczema will enable you to know your disease better and manage it more effectively. With iControl Eczema, you will be able to view your daily eczema scores on a graph. You can also set reminders on iControl Eczema+ to remind you to apply your moisturiser. Various eczema guidelines suggest that moisturisers should be the first line and mainstay of eczema treatment. In particular, ceramide-dominant therapeutic moisturisers would be important in repairing the skin barrier. iControl Eczema is based on the Patient Eczema Severity Time [PEST] score. For more information on the PEST score, please refer to Mason JM et al., BMC Dermatol 2013.

You can also set reminders on iControl Eczema+ to remind you to apply your moisturiser. Various eczema guidelines suggest that moisturisers should be the first line and mainstay of eczema treatment. In particular, ceramide-dominant therapeutic moisturisers would be important in repairing the skin barrier. iControl Eczema is based on the Patient Eczema Severity Time [PEST] score. For more information on the PEST score, please refer to Mason JM et al., BMC Dermatol 2013.

Real skin care starts on the inside-if you give your body the tools it needs to fix the Eczema damaged skin, you will have a definite advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing to eat the wrong foods while trying to clear up your Eczema is like trying to run your car without gasoline! It just can’t get going! Scientists have found that foods with high acidity are linked to increased Eczema symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason high acid content makes the skin more prone to irritation, which of course brings on the Eczema. You can avoid this by obviously steering clear of acidy foods, which is easier than it sounds. A dietician should be able to steer you the right way though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFear not though, there is a much simpler way to improve this too-kelp supplements. Kelp is very high in alkali, which will neutralize the acid it finds in your system, so you may find relief there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoisturize Regularly-\r\n\r\nYou need to get into a habit of moisturizing your skin at least twice a day, preferably after taking a bath or shower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is great for your skin because the more moisture there is inside it, the suppler it will be, and obviously soft supple skin is far less likely to crack and itch than dry flaky skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason you need to apply the moisturizer after bathing or showering is because this will help lock in the moisture from the bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should pat yourself almost dry with a very soft towel, and then apply the moisturizer to damp skin. It’s a little harder to rub in, but it’s worth it in the long run!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect Yourself-\r\n\r\nBe aware of all the things than can trigger your Eczema, and do your best to avoid them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, avoid wearing any kind of perfume or scent, as well as all scented soaps or toiletries. You will also probably find a little relief if you can get rid of all the perfumed detergents in your home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can wash your clothing in unscented natural detergents you will probably find that your clothing is suddenly not so itchy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I’ve tried to illustrate here, you don’t have to go to huge lengths to get some control in the battle against your eczema. In most cases all you need is common sense and some consistency. I hope these tips bring you some relief, but remember to be consistent!",

        "description": "Eczema is a painful and irritating skin disease that can be cured if treated correctly (especially when natural eczema remedies are used, which is what I'll discuss later on in this article). It typically affects infants and children, although symptoms can be seen all the way up and through adulthood. Not only that, but some people don't get eczema until they get older.\r\n\r\nEczema symptoms can vary from person to person, but they usually have similar characteristics. You can spot eczema by itchiness, redness or dry, leathery and scaly looking skin. Worse off, if you constantly scratch eczema, it can make it ooze and cause more pain overall.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are a number of ways to eliminate eczema and keep it under control. The most logical step in treatment is to take a trip to your family doctor to be properly diagnosed. At this point, your doctor is likely to prescribe a cream or ointment to use for your eczema. The downfall here is that this medicine is filled with powerful chemicals which can cause eczema to react worse and should only be used in extreme cases. This is where many people turn to natural eczema remedies to help treat and control their eczema.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of natural eczema remedies. One, for example, is to avoid any stress or environmental allergens and chemicals, as these can all trigger eczema to flare up. Another effective natural eczema remedy is to keep your body hydrated at all times. Don't take long showers or baths (as this dries out the skin) and drink plenty of water daily. Only use natural creams and ointments on the skin to help soothe it and ease the pain.\r\n\r\nOatmeal is another amazing home remedy for eczema. It can be made into a cream that will help soothe your skin and relieve the itching often associated with eczema. Or, it can be mixed in with warm bath water. To do this, add a cup or two of raw oatmeal to a bathtub of warm water. Let your body soak in it for roughly 20 to 30 minutes to help ease itching and pain.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing everyone dealing with eczema must look at their diet. Believe it or not, certain foods can help ease symptoms. With that said, you also need to be aware of the foods that can also cause your eczema to flare up, too. Food preservatives, dairy and any foods containing gluten can cause eczema to have an adverse reaction. Various vitamins and supplements can help the skin. In fact, vitamins like A and E are popular natural eczema remedies and are also quite effective.\r\n\r\nRemember - If you're going to treat your eczema, it's been shown and proven that natural eczema remedies are safer than most prescription creams and ointments. Plus, there are less side effects to worry about with natural eczema remedies. As long as you know how to use them properly, natural eczema treatments can help you finally get your eczema under control!\r\n\r\nDownload the app to know more..",

        "description": "What is Eczema? Eczema is a skin condition commonly known as dermatitis which can result in dry flaky skin which can be itchy and feel hot. This sensation often leads to vigorous itching which in turn can damage the skin. The word Eczema comes from the Greek words that mean “to boil over”. The word Dermatitis comes from the Greek word for skin. Both words refer to the same condition though. There are four types of eczema, (atopic, varicose, discoid and contact/dermatitis). Atopic Eczema is the most common form of Eczema. It is linked to hay fever and asthma. There is a tendency for it to be inherited, but there are also environmental factors which are important as well. Atopic means extra sensitivity to certain substances (allergens) e.g. dust mites, cat and dog fur etc. It affects 15-20% of young children in the UK, however, in about 70% of these cases, it clears up. If it doesn’t clear up, then it is likely that the condition will get worse as the patient gets older. For some reason, the number of cases of Atopic eczema have increased in recent times. Varicose Eczema affects the lower legs of patients. It is associated with varicose veins and is often a pre-cursor to varicose vein problems. It is also associated with poor circulation. Unlike Atopic eczema, it tends to affect the middle aged and the elderly. Contact/Dermatitis Eczema can be either an acute or chronic skin reaction where there is a sensitivity to a particular material. This reaction may be an allergic or non-allergic reaction. This condition is caused when the bodies immune system reacts with a particular substance. Discoid Eczema can occur at any point in a persons life, however, it tends to appear at a later stage in life. It tends to affect the lower legs and feet and shows itself as a distinct round patch of eczema. What are the symptoms of Eczema? Atopic This type of Eczemas symptoms normally include red, dry, itchy skin. There may also be some small water blisters which can weep on the hands and feet. Scaly areas will develop as well where the skin has been continually scratched. Varicose The symptoms for Varicose Eczema start with a mild itchiness just above the ankle. This will then become speckled and inflamed as well as becoming itchy. On occasion, ulcers can form. Contact/Dermatitis This type of Eczema usually starts out with a rash in the area where the trigger substance has come into contact with the skin. Once the eczema has been triggered, then the eczema can spread through the body. Discoid Normally, one or a number of round patches of red skin appear. They may be itchy and become blistered. It is also quite common for these patches to be infected with bacteria. What is the treatment for Eczema? As with all conditions and diseases, it is usually best to talk to your doctor before embarking upon any course of treatment. The information below is purely for information purposes only and I always recommend that you read the information below and then go and talk to a medical professional. There doesn’t appear to be a cure for eczema, however, there are a number of treatments which can control the symptoms of this very uncomfortable condition. There are a number of over the counter creams which will help to soothe your eczema of which there are two types. These are emollients which are moisturisers which will soothe and hydrate the skin. A good time to apply these creams is straight after a bath while your skin is still slightly moist.",

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",

        "description": "Eczema is a painful and irritating skin disease that can be cured if treated correctly (especially when natural eczema remedies are used, which is what I'll discuss later on in this article). It typically affects infants and children, although symptoms can be seen all the way up and through adulthood. Not only that, but some people don't get eczema until they get older.\r\n\r\nEczema symptoms can vary from person to person, but they usually have similar characteristics. You can spot eczema by itchiness, redness or dry, leathery and scaly looking skin. Worse off, if you constantly scratch eczema, it can make it ooze and cause more pain overall. \r\n\r\nThankfully, there are a number of ways to eliminate eczema and keep it under control. The most logical step in treatment is to take a trip to your family doctor to be properly diagnosed. At this point, your doctor is likely to prescribe a cream or ointment to use for your eczema. The downfall here is that this medicine is filled with powerful chemicals which can cause eczema to react worse and should only be used in extreme cases. This is where many people turn to natural eczema remedies to help treat and control their eczema.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of natural eczema remedies. One, for example, is to avoid any stress or environmental allergens and chemicals, as these can all trigger eczema to flare up. Another effective natural eczema remedy is to keep your body hydrated at all times. Don't take long showers or baths (as this dries out the skin) and drink plenty of water daily. Only use natural creams and ointments on the skin to help soothe it and ease the pain.\r\n\r\nOatmeal is another amazing home remedy for eczema. It can be made into a cream that will help soothe your skin and relieve the itching often associated with eczema. Or, it can be mixed in with warm bath water. To do this, add a cup or two of raw oatmeal to a bathtub of warm water. Let your body soak in it for roughly 20 to 30 minutes to help ease itching and pain.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing everyone dealing with eczema must look at their diet. Believe it or not, certain foods can help ease symptoms. With that said, you also need to be aware of the foods that can also cause your eczema to flare up, too. Food preservatives, dairy and any foods containing gluten can cause eczema to have an adverse reaction. Various vitamins and supplements can help the skin. In fact, vitamins like A and E are popular natural eczema remedies and are also quite effective.",

Not only that, but some people don&#39;t get eczema until they get older.<br><br>Eczema symptoms can vary from person to person, but they usually have similar characteristics. You can spot eczema by itchiness, redness or dry, leathery and scaly looking skin.

I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",

For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",

I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",

I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event. The only thing I would love to see to improve it would be some sort of graph or chart as part of the report showing any patterns instead of having to read back through all of my entries to see if I can find any links."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "Update: There was a delay and I was able to get it to work. I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",
            "Great way to get prescriptions for issues already known to you. I'm sure they're helpful in diagnosing new issues as well. Definitely great for someone with a busy schedule.",
            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",

It is caused by allergies against environmental allergies, such as pollen, house dust mites, moulds, etc. CAD accounts for around 60% of all allergies seen in dogs. It is characterised by a vicious cycle of inflammation, pruritus and excoriation, leading to repeated skin damage. \r\n\r\nCAD is difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of dermatitis, such as fleas, food allergy, etc. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI)-4 has been developed by leading veterinary dermatologists. With this scoring system the vet can see how serious the disease is, and once treated, measure the progress. It is also a very visual way to explain the situation and improvements to clients. \r\n\r\nManagement of patients with CAD is equally difficult, and often requires life-long multimodal management, including environmental modification, drugs, shampoos, topicals and specially formulated nutrition.  \r\n\r\n* References:\r\n1.

The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nDon't forget to share it with other doctors.",

            "To me, the app was not user-friendly. I found myself entering the same information repeatedly and sometimes the data just would not save (specifically in the Goals section). Second, the format provides low visibility. I was looking for something thst displays data like a calendar with icons and notes to show my doctors an overall picture of my health for each day. This is more like a database that has to be searched by individual criteria. I can't use this app in its current format.",

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",
            "Gameplay has become fantastic since the last update. Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence. I have earned over 30 million essence but still haven't finished it up yet. But the legendary essence is getting finished quickly. Please resolve this issue.",
            "such a great game to play, even without in-app purchases. Down fall is, glitches during power-ups, exits app during battle or during a game purchase. Fix the huccups :( even after this little update, game still cuts out during game play. Really sad, I'd like a refund",

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

        "recentChanges": "&gt; Yuck! Get outta here, nasty bugs! We got rid of them all.<br>&gt; Loving this game? Rate us &amp; leave a review!<br>&gt; We&#39;ve made game-play improvements. Get playing!",
        "comments": [
            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "If you love ads interupting game play, this one is for you!!! You'll get to experience more ad time than game time. You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "I was so excited when I found this app. Then was super disappointed once I started/ tried to use it. I just had a blood test recently that listed 17 foods that I am sensitive to, eggs, cheese, pineapple, rice as well as gluten just to name a few. I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",
            "Limited food selection. For example, acorn squash not listed. Grey color coding not explained. Would not use as definitive guide. Last updated over 2 years ago.",

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "I thought I was gonna give it another chance but it's way to pay to win. If you guys could lean more towards the free-to-play players and set it a pay-to-win players then this game will be way bigger. You guys add a new character like every month how are free to play players supposed to get those characters? Every time a new character comes out I have 100 Shino bites but it's like 500 to summon that doesn't make sense. Y'all won't see this cuz I drowning in money. Free-to-play games are best!!!",
            "I love this game. It gives you all characters at the beginning and gives you easy chances of earning their cards and developing your village expeditiously and the graphics are amazing. Anything with Naruto I live for and I'm glad I have happen to be introduced to this game. But my problem is that the game consistently logs me out making me have to use the game's currency (Shinobite) just to restore my energy. Other than that I enjoy it and look forward to more ideas unfolding in the game!",
            "Please fix the S.A.M. Event. This is the 2nd time I'm unable to play properly as the game crashes when the mission starts. I already contacted the support team for this before and tried their advise on clearing the cache from the game itself, but the issue persists. And from the looks of it, I'm not the only one having the issue. I actually enjoy this game but the crashing issue with S.A.M. is irritating. Please fix it!",
            "Despite the constant kick out from attack missions, the game is overall good, just gotta work on the app to where it wont kick players out of the attack missions. I am aware that there are others battling the same issue, so im adressing me as well as the others that battle the same issue. The sam missions will not work for me and the team missions for the Naruto ( kumara link mode) aren't working either, please fix these issues for other players and me.",
            "So unfortunate, such great potential, such poor delivery! Now more P2W than ever! Well laid out and easy to navigate with plenty to do and lots of useless characters. New characters are going to be p2w walled requiring upto 8000 Shinobites, which are priced sooo absolutely insanely high for what you get. Psuedo \"daily\" missions never seem to reset, so they should just call them \"monthly\" missions. Ai pathfinding is terrible. A fun game that could be great if they care to actually fix problems..."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

You're a waste of time and stop me from playing the games I love.",

Today I found some sort of glitch that some of the games I played, it said that they were played 1st January 1970 for some reason AND NO MATTER WHAT I DID IT STAYED LIKE THAT!!!! I found it absolutely ANNOYING and I need you to know about it and fix it, GOOGLE!!!!! >:(|",

But even after enabling automatic sign-in to the supported games, it's not connecting sometimes. We have to connect from the game. In the achievement section for each game, my achievements are not showing. Sometimes I am not able to connect with the supported games, I don't know why. Please fix this problems, also I'm finding bugs in the app.",

But now in this update you can play MORE different games, ADD friends, EARN achievements ( that was old lol) but still. Look how much it offers you! It's incredible, It's one of the apps that you can actually never get bored of. Good job developers, I'm more than surprised!! :))",
            "Loved what this app was doing until I had to get a new phone. Now some of the games I've played lost all the progress I made in them because my profile no longer exists even though I never deleted it and its under the same Gmail. It wants me to create a new one and doesn't offer a way to try and recover my original one. Typically would care but I invested a lot of time and a little money in marvels contest of champions and now its all gone."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",
            "Worst app ever ! It doesnt even record my voice and says everytime that app needs more of your voice to give better results.",
            "This app has seriously improved in the past couple of years, I'm impressed.",
            "The clarity of the recorded voice is not clear like it used to be."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

            "Cannot listen to most of the music I purchased on Google Play in this new app. I was always reluctant to \"buy\" music online like on Google Play and this is exactly why. Seems like it must intentionally be a scam, because otherwise there's absolutely no excuse for Google not making it a crystal clear and perfect transition for previously PURCHASED music.",
            "Awful! The quality of sound is subpar. Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",
            "Worst app ever. Way to take a step backwards. I want a refund for all my purchased songs through google play! I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "It works well and easy to use . A good app for beginners in drum set learning. Rate it 4 star because some lessons are not opening up requires one to run an add",
            "Latest Update trashed everything. please fix. Latest update has ruined all downloads. For now everyone AFFECTED by this BUG should go and clear the storage under you apps section. I'm on a Google Pixel 3 Android 11",
            "I am learning to play the guitar and so I need an app like this to help me record backing drum tracks for my practicing. I like the fact that you can see the parts and PLAY THEM and actually listen to the different sounds of the drum set...GREAT. What the app does not offer me, is the chance to place those sounds in a certain order, combine sounds and record the sequence and actually be able to use it as a backing track for your guitar learning. As it is, I see no practical use for it.",
            "I like the overall sound and smooth running of the app. I think it could be much better if you added more features such as being able to move around the pieces to arrange the kit in a way I like, an option to lock the bass drum with a cymbal so every time I hit the cymbal it also hits the bass drum automatically, add a choke to the cymbal, maybe individually adjust each kit piece's volume, and perhaps more options for different sounds (maybe a china, a third crash, a different ride/bell).",
            "I gave it 4 stars because of the delay I'm expiriencing on my tablet. It is fine on my phone and works well but I think it's cause I have an older version on it. I just got my tablet so I'm guessing I have the newest version of it. Please fix the delay and I'll rewrite this with a 5 star rating. The app deserves a 10 star rating when it's working well. It really is a great app. Just that one little🤏 prob. I have faith that it'll bs fixed. Thank you 🙂"

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Ok I don't even care anymore. This is honestly a great game. But tone it down with the forced ads a bit. And the tranquilizer darts are too annoying. Nerf them please. And also, I think you should add at least these things. 1. Add a drill weapon for the normal vehicle. (Not the ultimate ones.) 2. Make it so you get 3 - 20 free gems every day. (I will love you if you do this.) last one. Add mythic and secret rarity parts. Mythic chances: 0.01383% Secret chances: 0.0000112% (add mythic boxes too.)",
            "I am a prestige 60 player. Played this game over a year to achieve that. Watch all the ads everyday. I am a gang leader as well. But since the day they introduce the purple darts, which makes players with them almost invincible. This whole game becomes a very uneven playing ground. Of the developer is not going to make playing this game fair. I will petition to get a lot of players to forever quit playing this game. Very dissapointed that I wasted one over years on you.",
            "Played this game for 1 and a half years. By the time they introduced the tranquilizer darts, the game becomes medium to EXTREMELY HARD. LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT ANYONE WITH IT. AND HOW CAN ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS IT!? CAN'T ADVANCE TO PRESTIGE 5 WITHOUT PLAYING THIS GAME FOR MONTHS!! very disappointed in you, C. A. T. S. At least nerf the gun. Reduce the stun time from five seconds to two, maybe. Help me out here because THIS IS THE EIGHTH WEEK OF TRYING TO ADVANCE TO STAGE 23.",
            "I'm hooked, my son is hooked, my daughter is hooked. Genuinely the best mobile game I've played. The adds were a bit intrusive in the beginning, but it is a free game after all and the gameplay kept me coming back regardless. After a few days I payed to remove them. Lets face it, the developers deserve support for such an excellent game. **Edit 27/10/20: they've added a couple of items (tranquiliser gun I'm looking at you!) that have horribly unbalanced the game, ruining the fun completely.",
            "I've played this game for like 2 or more years. Darts destroyed the gameplay even though I've got two from the grand prix. It just narrows down the game and downgrades it to less creative levels. Also, I think that I'm closest ever to deleting the game from my device at this point."

I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

Just add more items to the customize hub maybe add more tattoos and more hairstyles and an option to type your name on gloves😁and make the characters movements more realistic like dodging and the way they throw a punch.. Thank you developers for this great game🤩🤩🤩",

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

The moves are made for losers and hope that no one downloads this game. If you are a fair winner then you won't download it. I wish there was something called as 0 stars, cause that is what the game deserves 😡🤬😠🤮",

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

            "This game is insanely good!! I have an underaged account, which is very annoying because it blocks some features, but it is still the BEST game I have ever played!! The graphics are very good and the gameplay is even better! All these people that say that it is PTP (Pay To Play) are WRONG!! I am at the max level and am very good, I have never payed anything! Hope anybody who plays this game enjoys it! Thank you very much EA for making such an amazing game!",
            "I love this game. I don't spend and still enjoy it, although it is a grind, so don't expect any quick progression without spending. My one suggestion would be to have a randomized pull in the beginning that gives you a random but guaranteed character. Doesn't have to be anyone amazing. 1 or 2 star character that then makes your experience of the game unique. I know you can try and pull from a chromium card but no guarantees and gems are too valuable as f2p.",
            "The game goes out of its way to ensure you're not making any decent progress without spending huge amounts. In the first 3 1/2 years of the game, new content and characters were frequent, though in the past year or so this has seen a rapid decline. Game modes have grown stale and repetitive. Any new characters have ridiculous requirements to obtain them, we are talking 6 month to a year to unlock. The game lacks balance, leveling up/gearing characters is an endless grind with little reward.",
            "Collect Star wars characters, what more can I say. Have had the game over 2 years now and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The game has its ups and downs, and of course there is a pay to win element, but it's in no way essential. Metas change fairly regularly and all eras of star wars are given their fair share of attention. The game also offers a great variety of game modes: Single player PVE, guild based PVE, single player PVP and guild based PVP. A fan of star wars must have this game.",
            "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF RIP OFFS. Just ok. Starts out fun, but then the game becomes total pay for play. The prices they ask are ridiculous. Supply drops r a joke since 99% of what you get, is fairly useless. No really special stuff gets dropped and updating characters & ships, unless you're willing to drop serious coin - isn't happening. The new characters are impossible to get without $. Don't bother trying to contact the developers - you'll never get an answer."

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

        "comments": [
            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Best game I ever played it is not lagging you dont need ads to buy and equip anything and it is so easy I love it so much no words can describe how much I love this game",
            "This is the worst game ive ever played. I dont recommend this game to anyone. This took me 4 hours to download litteraly 1 percent every 2 minutes, then i get the worst possible experience of my life. Also, ads every single level and usually i instantly die because theres 6 wheel spikes at the very beginning not timed right to be possible. I dont care what you do to this game, im never playing it again.",

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

            "I like the game it's it's fun you can play with it and a and also I can jump up and down and said the only thing is at the jump on my back instead of my stomach jumping I can't do backflips and I also at the light on my legs so it's pretty challenging for me but it's going to be fine So yeah so I like to know as much but it's what is popular and it's good so I gave a",
            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",
            "okok so first things first this game is literally the best and if u turn off wifi/turn on airplane mode there is so ads second things the game glitched out sometimes but it is super funny to see the characters and the trampolines dislocate themselves lastly i would totally reccomend this game and if u rate 1 star bcuz u dont like it ur a loser no offense",

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "I downloaded this game at the first ad I saw for it because I'm a huge Lego fan. I can safely say I haven't been disappointed. It's got plenty of content to keep you entertained and all the E rated humor you expect out of a Lego title. The roster keeps expanding and the devs clearly care about the community. If you like legos, this will definitely be your type of game.",
            "So far it's pretty awesome! The actual licensed soundtrack is great!! Plays like other collection turn based strategy games, so easy to pick up if you have played others of this style. Fun dialogue, as always from the comedy of the Lego team! Definitely worth checking out! Be aware, these are definitely aimed at getting you to spend $, so you will progress annoying slow after you hit the end of what they consider the \"Free to play\" portion, around level 25.",
            "It's awesome to see lego figurines having personalities. Nice, cute and funny store. Cool gameplay mechanics, but that's all to it. Like every other mobile game, this one with no exception has heavy monetization. And I mean huge! Some items are more expensive than their counterparts in real life. P2W/P2P mechanics, season passes and outrageous macro transactions. Shame on you lego. Even for a fan like me who spent more than $10k on lego sets, thinks prices in this game are ridiculous.",
            "Another update, less fun. Pay for new figures, pay for new sets: it's all about the $$$. Disgusting. The graphics, music, sounds and dialog are fantastic but even after a couple of months of playing it's horrible. Totally unfair and unbalanced gameplay. Updates provide more paid content and bugs, no balancing or fixes. Store is insanely overpriced and very low value. Membership is only for two weeks instead of a month. Shameless LEGO cash grab, stay away.",
            "Unfortunately a majority of mo(MMASBOY)bile gamers still isnt able, to notice, how botted & rigged, endless-collections are! If you played other collection games, you have seen highly inbalanced, inequal & unfair concepts like this already. It is blamable that LEGO damages its reputation by licencing a mass-product game with such childish wannabe-competition! Mobile designers are incapable to provide balanced, equal & fair conditions, so why always spoil games with awkward contests & events?!?"

One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "It's a wonderful time killing game, but once you get passed stage 45 the characters you are fighting will double in there health, power etc; when you and your opponent are on even power on all earlier stages. Then stage 45 comes and your opponent is on a power level of 2000 and you are still on power level 800, what are you supposed to do?...and even worse it stays at this unfair disadvantage (basically it needs a ranking system) (Otherwise your only choice is to rage or switch characters)",
            "The game itself is not so bad. Nothing too much to do but a decent time killer. The thing that bothers me is that ea so blatantly attempted this to be a cash grab for them. In-game transactions are not optional, they become more of a necessity. After a few rounds the opponents start coming so overpowerd that it literally becomes impossible to climb to their level without using real money. I am at level 219, my health is 9000 and the opponent i am fighting has a health of 65k. Really ea?",
            "Sad. More EA sadness. Can't move yourself around with a left toggle, it pushes you in automatically. You just spam punch in hopes it lands, randomly tapping an icon on the left side of the screen where you should be able to move, for special attacks...ground and pound is quickest to accumulate abilities on takedowns/grapples. Really its not a good experience at all, for a fighting style about \"control.\" If i wanted to play a tap \"boxing\" game, id play that AND be able to control my character.",
            "Overall, this game is pretty alright. But it gets mundane pretty early on. Graphics aren't that great either. An obvious money grabber from EA. Watch UFC and play the latest games on console, this one just isn't it. Hoping for another developer to come along and revolutionize this franchise, but until then, stay on consoles :)",
            "Could be better if the computer followed the same set of rules as the player, player can NEVER punch the computer fighter out of a special move but the computer can ALWAYS simply punch the player to completely stop any special move, computer can use body hook to stop take down, player cannot, also it is physically impossible to knock someone out by kicking them in the shin"

Other wise everything thing is fabulous",

            "The game is really fun. I enjoy earning coins and buying new skins, and just simply playing the game. However, the amount of adverts is starting to get annoying. You have to watch an advertisement after a game of hide and seek, after you get released from the cage after you get caught in a game, and if you want a free skin. If the amount of advertisements decreases, it will be a 5 star rating, because the game is great but the advertisements are super annoying.",
            "I played this game 5 times. You if you want to play it do it. Otherwise don't, this game forces you to turn on your wifi just for them to play ads. I have tried profusely to turn it off just for me to play in peace, the players aren't real but that's okay with me. I've been interested with this game for ages now, but the ads are pissing me off. If this game wants money do it in a way that it won't make others mad. Final Rating: 4/10",
            "This game is really good i like it and i like to play it during free time when the internet is not good. But...i really think that...it would be better if..we put some gender and we can dress up like there's a boy and a girl. And also, i want it to be a larger place like there is a real hiding spot because we keep walking around. So....i think that's my suggestion. But still! The game is really good! Thank you"

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "10/12/20 - This app used to work great, then Android 11 came. I am using a Pixel 2 device that otherwise works with everything. The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",
            "This app has been amazing for 10 years straight! I can't believe it's been that long. Dear developer of this app, thank you for your attention to simplicity, detail and simply having the courage to not bloat this app over time! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "It does what it does. Would like the option to have data stored in the cloud only, and load pictures and videos when needed. More options in slideshow would be great (time per picture, randomize button more accessible).",
            "Android 11 killed the app. Crashing, can't play my videos anymore, can never find my exports in my gallery. Please fix the issues with Android 11."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "Absolutely Amazing. Very Addictive and Amazing Speed. Just one thing. So many Ads. But other than that it is the best game I have ever played in my whole life. I also love how you put a Daily Race where we actually get to play with real players. I have absolutely nothing to say. Just It is an Amazing game. I recommend you to download this. It's Amazing.",
            "This game was great and made me feel like I was playing mirrors edge all over again. It did have ads, but that's not why I am not giving it 5 stars as it's a mobile game and I only saw an add every 3 to 4 stages. The reason I am rating it 4 and not 5 is the frame rate. Frame rate is key in these sorts of games. It ran smoothly mostly but sometimes I would encounter frame drops, not massive, but enough to send me plummeting to my doom. Otherwise, the controls are great. And no micro transactions"

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",

And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

But one thing I don't like is whenever I watch ads to earn better things I always loose to the other team, I tried both teams ballet and Hip hop, but I keep 💯 loosing. :) and dont tell me to stay safe,😡",
            "Very good app! I love how you can dress yourself and everything! The only problem is almost everything is locked. Makeup, clothes, dance moves, and more. That's how the game get boring.. I mean, what the point?! You can got to the doctor , spa , or take a selfie.. All you can really do is put makeup on, go to the gym, dress up, and do dance moves all over again! I do the ballet and I am getting tired of using the same dresses again.. (Turn off WiFi if too many ads)OTHERWISE, GOOD APP!!!!!!!",
            "I really used to like Coco games☺ until I was wanting to get the full version of the game , so I clicked on it and it was $9.99 .Really?!?!😑And almost everything costs money 😒😾Also when I was playing the game I was going against Hip-hop we got a higher number then they did but Hip-hop won!😡Are number was 3,444,589 and Hip-hop got 900😐 I would give it 5 stars if it did not lie.😠😡😡😡",
            "I would 100% recommend! Grate app. When I'm bored I love playing this game, it makes me love dance even more! Also amazing job to whoever made this game :) oh and, other people are saying there's to many adds? Maybe it is just their device. On my device (iPad) I don't get many. Thank you for taking the time to make this game!",
            "Okay I absolutely LOVE this game. I love how you can choose Hip Hop or Ballet. They are both amazing. I just wish that more things would be unlocked for free, or at least like \"Watch 5 videos to unlock!\" or something. But if you're look for something fun to play and pass time, ( It's especially useful during Covid-19) I reccomend this game."

            "This game is focused on making its players worse whenever a player gets knocked out he cant get up he needs to spend gems coins or watch a ad but whenever a bot gets knocked out he gets super fast this, games last no more than 45 seconds and the graphics could better i think if they used there money from their ads and chagnged the game up it could be better but from now on i wont reccomond this game to friends",
            "this game would be getting a lot more 5 stars if it wasn't for those damned ads. i got an ad on loading screen on my 1st game. if only the devs weren't so greedy, then it would be a really good fighting game for mobile phone. but on it's current state though, i wouldn't recommend because of the egregious monetisation.",
            "It's all around a decent game but the dodge button and the training buttons for example for speed the hit boxes are too small If you don't hit them dead center it won't register I have lost and almost lost plenty of matches just because the dodge button didn't register",
            "Was good until for some unknown reason in Tournament mode can only use one arm, and even if I win the match using only one arm instead of advancing in the tournament, I go backwards not forward In regular game play both left and right punches can be thrown, what a load of horse sh*@",
            "It seems it doesn't even know simple addition dropping it down from a 2 to a one. Visually pleasing however the fights are really underwhelming. This could be a good game if you try to make it one however it seems that you just dont want to try."

It is to small to put the photo of my face inside. I would like it if you make it bigger. And when I cut the persons hair, it is messy. Please make this game better.",
            "My 5 and 3 year old granddaughters love this game! I would give it 5 stars but I don't see an option to purchase an add free version. This is a challenge for the 3 year old as the ads messes up her game play. I'm one of those people who will purchase a game to remove ads and sadly, that doesn't appear to be an option.",
            "Great game!!! but could you make them ask for a specific style or color of hair and with stars you can unlock new people and please make there be no adds. But other than that I love it!!",
            "Uuh, its kinda' Boring... and sometimes when i open it, i Cant touch in the objects, they wont go to the girl, and sometimes i Cant even press home butoon! I dont like it much. Guys, if you want hairstyle games, there are much better ones Then this. Sorry for Being so Critical. tHanks for Reading this until the end.",
            "My granddaughter loves this game. It keeps her busy. She is 5 and can play very easily with out my help. Although we do like to take turns. Taking your own pic and saving her styles is a great feature."

It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",
            "30 second ads, 20 second gameplay, rinse, repeat. Greedy ad revenue grab by developer. Hey developers, are you listening? It's actually faster to play the game, start an ad, force quit the game and restart the game. That's faster than watching an ad every single time.",
            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

Surely it does not match the most accure sounds with their real animals like, look it, Rhinoceros and Wolf sounds there is big different with their real sounds and ones in this app even Zebra and dog, and others still not accurate sounds. Too fake the sound of Mosquitoes. Totally it's misleading one avoid it. For me I will not recommend this for anyone.!"

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "The game overall has a pretty original concept, its fun for all ages. It also releives my stress. Theres a few things I dont like but ill give it a 4 star because this is a pretty good game.",
            "Great concept but it would be great if you had two separate skills for two different modes (Solo/Practice, which is the one we have now, and real multiplayer) TL;DR Great game for airplanes, but multiplayer needed.",
            "This app is wonderful!, i play this game after online class and this is a huge relief that i found these games. However there are a couple of fatal flaws, firstly. Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",
            "I like it, but I got a glitch where you fall in the water and don't die. Fix This! (Son of Claire)",
            "I LOVE THIS GAME. They fixed all the bugs that are in the game. Plus they even have more skins. The only thing is that they make you watch a stupid add. I know i know. You get money bye doing that but come on eith this many adds. But other than that. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉"

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

            "I rlly enjoy it but EVERYTHING is ads . I think I spent more time watching ads than play games . Also , alot of things cost money and would not recommend for a little fry . But in all the consept of the game is child friendly but not whith 2 yr olds. Dose anyone else think its wired that you can be a HUMAN!? And no I can't hold my breath for more than 15 seconds thank you very much. I just realized this got random. Well have an awesome day! 'Put a bannana in your ear ' - Jason Steel",
            "The game is very nice to play and good for passing time ,but there is one big problem. The problem is that there are much adds.Only 2 adds of thrill rush and uphil rush are repeated before a level. I am bored because of the adds. Please fix this problem as much faster as you can.",
            "This is very nice game😇 but the reason I gave it 4 stars is This 👀, sometimes it stop working in easy words you can say it become hang😔😔and it takes very much time to start😴 or you can say it takes much time for downloading 😕other wise this is good game 😍you must also download this game😋 it doesn't let the people's bored😏 this is the best game for fun😝 ,enjoyment😜 , happiness😛 and for free time too 😃",
            "This game is sooo cute I won many rounds in the dolphin show and played it all day when I was a kid. This is a dream come true to customize a dolphin of mine and it's a fun game to play for the whole family. I would rather download it now rather than in 2013."

            "This is a great game!I have played this since 2015. But the reason I'm reviewing now is because I am bored.We need missions like bump 3 red cars or drive around the map and it gives u like 50 cash. The other reason is cos I feel like we need like way more maps and since I've stuck with the game so long I don't want to be let down by one update that has needed to be added. Only reason I have 5 stars is cos 1. I'm addicted and 2. U can turn off data for ads so idk y ppl complain about ads!"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

The only thing I could say could be improved is the amount of ink you get. The bosses have GIANT vehicles and I'm on level 550 and dont have much ink. The ink cost so much after you buy about 5 lots and it doesnt give you that much. Overall, I love this game!",

            "So in the top left corner you can see how the opponents car and figure out what you can make to destroy it best this game is amazingly good 👍 👌 💯",
            "It reminds me of robot wars. Draw your car and destroy. Glitch where car flies into the sky and you cant tell what happening is a little annoying. New enemies and bosses in the future would be nice. Maybe harder difficulties with them having cannons and a smarter AI that moved on its own.",
            "It's pretty simple and addicting. I just wish it were more challenging. Right now the AI reacts to whatever you're doing. It won't charge on its own or anything, you basically control both your car and the other car. You can also overpower yourself to the point of almost everything being too easy to be any fun. Wall-less maps are pretty much worthless because you can just ram the other car off immediately. Stronger and more intelligent enemies would be a great addition."

            "Fantastic and super convenient service. Knowing that you can speak to a Dr via video call on the same day that you feel unwell is a blessing. Not having to go to the surgery especially during this pandemic is so reassuring. Dr was very friendly, listened to all my points and gave great advice. I REALLY recommend this service, although your GP surgery does need to be signed up for you to use it. If they aren't badger them until they do.",
            "Finally! Been asking for this kind of advance from the NHS for years - as a diabetic of 30 years I despise having to take time off work to attend my GP surgery for a \"medication review\", this meant I could take a lunch break and complete the appointment easily without inconvenience and hopefully freed up an in person appointment for someone who actually needed it. The app is well designed and UI is intuitive and simple. Face recognition sign in is a nice additional feature to improve simplicity",
            "I've downloaded the app. I've paid my money for the appointment. And half an hour before the appointment went to connect to the app. Can't connect..... Biometric hardware unavailable. Missed my appointment good money down the drain !!! RUBBISH !!!!! SO PISSED OFF !!!!!!",
            "Really easy to use. Far more convenient for an initial consultation unless you're specifically looking for a physical examination of course",
            "Brilliant service, easy to book with regular updates and the doctor was lovely and really helpful. Easier than trying to go to a doctors surgery currently."

I can only play it on airplane mode, but then i cannot get the upgraded canon and other things. so it is annoyingggggg. please fix it..... i gave 1 star because of that. otherwise the game is great. so sorry.",

Although it's free to play, I expect to watch ads, however, there are ads before & after each level, from 2 ads @ 5 seconds each and many 30 seconds.

            "it's a fun game but I love everything but I wish there was more weapons like ice guns and stuff another thing is that I would like a online mode and friends. So recently I haven't seen any bugs or glitches so far and the ads you can get rid of them. I have been playing for 2 years now. This review was 1 hole year ago It's Now 2020. Good game. Create more games you only have 2. Hey Mr. Develeper can you actually listen to me because We need an update with more weapons and career. More players.",
            "Really, really good game, play it with my friends all the time. It's really fun, but I think you should add an online section that counts your points when you win against actual humans. So you should add an online where you play against other people in the world and there should be a leaderboard, can you please add this. Please. And also this game is quite smooth on all phones that are generally modern.",
            "This is amazing. I played on a friends iPad and I loved it. The simple to understand but hardish to control battle style is a blast and evens the some op weapons out. I've mained cards as it is just so much fun, want to keep enimies back? Sticky card. Want to deal damage? Explosion card. About to fall off the edge? Place swap card. Anywho this game is just amazing and good gameplay. 5/5. Simply amazing.",
            "Hello developers i hope you see this! I've been playing this game for so long and i loved it!But here's what i really want you to add in a new update:- *Online Multiplayer (upto 4 players with big maps) *Skins:like colors,hats,mask,suit,and if you could add a shop section it would be nice! *Private lobby to play with friends:-) *Make more buttons for eg:- Jump,special power,shield, etc. So,please developers notice my concerns, just a little improvement would make your game more fun. Thanks.",
            "This game, is one of the most original games based off of popular pop-culture hostory. Which is very impresive from my point of view, this game is so good, other people make games that try to live up to this standard exactly how this came to sucess. I love this game and will appreiciate it for as long as it is avalible on this very app store... :]"

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "Stop showing me your ads! I am not interested in your games and I will not become interested in your games even if you keep pushing your ads at me 100 times per hour. I will just dislike you more. Oh god cut it out already! And again! Stop! Yet again? You're wasting your advertising budget. And again, you waste your ads. Your advertising system is cheating you, theu show your ads to the same people over and over again. No new people at all.",
            "I really like this game, but at level 25, there is no warning, difficulty does not increase, they just stop giving you goals to proceed, and the game is over. You can harvest all day, but you're not progressing any more. Also, the ad with the big long harvest blade is false advertising, you never see it. It was a fun game, but sadly lacking in the end.",
            "This is disturbingly addicting. I cant stop playing for some reason. I do have a slight issue with the controls, though. Sometimes it feels too sensitive, and sometimes it seems to turn in the opposite direction of where it want it to go. Also, time extension bonuses would be a wonderful addition. I feel bummed out when I'm so close to getting a personal goal, but im cut short by a few seconds.",
            "I love this game but it froze up. This is the second time. I had to delete it and reload the game. I,m not doing it again. No other game has done ever this! You get to level 25 and I guess thats it!! GAME Same old same old from then on. Done it, good bye, hope they expand it was fun.",
            "This game is SOOOO MUCH FUN. Its not got that many ads as others are saying it has. Its a good way to pass time but my only problem is sometimes when time is over it asks me if i want 2x more than i earned and i pressed \" no thanks \" but it still gave me an unskippable add. This has only happened 2 or 3 times so it doesnt ruin the overall game. Still 5 stars🤗"

            "Interesting game, graphics and sound good but, inability to move to the next stage though I was qualified, by winning in the previous stage and also investing the needed amount, is a put off... So please I hope you would work on it ASAP. Then I will give 5 stars",
            "Well the game is petty good but when i get a wide open 90% it misses and i cant stand that and when you go for a dunk it automatically just like looks like you're doing a layup but like why does it have to be in slow motion and when I go to unlock character I mean a new ball it just new ball action or or closed it just says new ball a lot and then he doesn't even show nothing like the game and then I'll give you a 5-star rating because this game should be like NBA 2K 20",
            "This is great, but I don't like the graphics of this game ,I'm dizzy by it's movements and the worst of all even I'm gonna dunk,shoot in 3 it won't shoot please fix it. So for now I'm giving it a 3. Until you fix it.",

            "This is a good game but I have given it only one star because it has 1 ad. after a match and at times when the match begins. Multiple time the app suddenly stops working. I first thought that it can be due to my device's ram, which is 2GB but later I found out a friends device which has this same game and ram as 6GB, while he is also facing the same issue. Please fix this.....",
            "I like the game, it has good graphics.but the things u should work on is the controls, because it is weak,when hitting your opponent the wrestler already smack u down.and another thing is there should be a commentator, during the fight.it's a good game in gameplay, but need to be upgraded.and the wrestler's are not real, no real names,no undertaker,or Justina..so poor.☹️☹️",
            "This game is rigged, everything is working against you. I'm giving it a second star because I'm actually enjoying the game. The stats of the characters are actually useless, because someone you're more than by far can just do as he pleases with you and your moves. It would have been a very wonderful game if you didn't make it very unfair to the players. How can a ref count slowly for you and count fast for your opponent in a game? It's a rigged game, not challenging at all, just rigged.",
            "The best wrestling game on the market, and as a fellow game developer extremely well done for what it is, the actual controls have a bit of a learning curve but its amazing once you get them down. I had to buy the full game. Super excited for the new one boss. :) if you need a tester i would be honored.",
            "It was a nice and wonderful game, good graphics, almost real characters and credible moves but I rate this 4 stars because I think it wasn't totally perfect. May I suggest that you can set those attack here as a finisher or mid-air counter like superkick or bicycle kick. I think there's also a mistake in this game. How a gaunt wrestlers lift up a chubby and 7 ft tall opponent? Then if your opponent kick up to your pin, you can't get up emmidiately instead your opponent get up first than you."

            "The only reason I'm choosing Pixel Phone is because of the camera. The quality was amazing ALL the time...until the recent update. No use of having great photos if the camera itself cannot be used. I've tried many ways to recover.. but it seems like nothing can be done to fix it. I've read many comments stating the same issue. Dear developer, please do something or you may lose more Pixel user..",
            "Updated phone in October after waiting as long as I could to not update it, and now the camera app no longer works. When I click it just shows a black screen with the camera interface over it, wait a few seconds, then it closes. I tried restarting phone, disabling app, removing other apps, shutting down phone entirely and waiting a while, and even a factory reset. Nothing has worked. Great timing for my trip to Yosemite. Thanks, Google.",
            "Google updated to androoid os 11 and camera won't work, just black screen like every one else. I've done a lot of research on this and it seems to be a widespread problem on not only the early pixels but also the new pixels. Google has had a class action law suit because of problems like this. Google does not care about you or else they would of resolved this. I was going to by the new pixel but now there's no chance in hell will I support the company.",
            "Took my first pictures with my new Pixel 5, the cool 2nd full moon of the month. The pictures are fuzzy, grainy, out of focus. Was excited to try night site. What a disappointment. My Pixel 1 takes better photos. Is this a bug?. Also, where did HDR+ go? No option to toggle or use, obviously didn't work for my moon photos.",
            "Camera stopped working completely after the last update. Tried everything to get it to work. Google was zero help and told me to go use a third party fix it service.... It's THEIR software that needs fixing. Extremely frustrating because my phone is in great condition but now it is useless. A smartphone without a functioning camera??? Do better, Google."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",

When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "This game is amazing! I've had this game for a couple months, but I'm writing a review now. I rlly like the Halloween update! It would be really nice you could do this for all holidays like Halloween. Also, could you make so when you play you not only get crates, but coins? I don't wanna spend money on coins to by skins with the coins. That's all, thank you for making this great game!",
            "It is overall a very good game.. I really like it. I would like to point out a few things. 1.There is no option to customize the control layout. It would be much better if you can add an option for users to customize the layout.. 2.It would be better if we can see if a game is ongoing or players are in lobby or it is about to start.",
            "The free revive and grenade redeem pack by watching an ad doesnt work anymore. I need that. Also the trampolines in School and Mall maps should be reworked. The trampoline's hitbox can cover a burger prop if it stands on top, in the middle of the trampoline, thus making it impossible to shoot through them. One last thing, the shoot and change prop buttons should be enlarged, or even resizable, and the pan control is only in the right half of the screen, it should be the whole screen."

            "It is a fun game and I enjoy playing. There are a lot of ads and they pop up randomly. The game also glitches and lags alot sometimes so much that I have to exit the app and lose the design, so I have to redo what I just did. This only happens after I have been playing for a little while and it usually glitches because of an ad. I also think that it could be more fun if yiu could design your own stuff and sell it or just to design it, so you can be more creative.",
            "Its an AMAZING game!!! I love it sooooo much. There is one problem. When I had been playing for quite a while I just had to repeat previous shirts, skirts, ect. Other than that its one of the most AWESOME games in the world. I hope you will add some more design's into the game.😘😘😘",
            "I've been playing this game for a long time . I maxed out all my upgrades and unlocked everything . I was playing for over 100 days then all of a sudden it started me again from DAY ONE.. Im super pissed because I never cared about all the stupid ads I just enjoyed the game then after all the time I've spent into this game for it to restart me to day one is a smack in the face...I will most likely be deleteing the app...VERY disappointing.",
            "Fun but needs more options. It would be great if you could make your own designs and have them for sale on the side, either auction style or in the shop. Also the way the ads are set up is not ideal for offline users. Unfair you can only get new things if you watch ads.",
            "This tie die game is so cool because like you just can do it like anything you want you have to make you close and everyone so cool like you can see all these world's there picture you have t-shirt pants skirts and all the people out there I think you should play this game is absolutely amazing OK bye see you guys later thank you for making this game I can wait to do it again😍😍😍"

        "description": "Ear piercing is very popular these days, this has been influenced a lot thanks to changing fashion statements. Ear piercing is expected to get much more popular. Atopic eczema has also become very common but very few studies have dealt with the idea that ear piercing itself could be responsible for causing eczema.\r\n\r\nEar piercing involves putting a hole in your ear and then putting a piece of metal through it. This leads to contact with heavy metals like nickel and cobalt. It is strictly advisable to do the piercing under perfectly hygienic conditions. Even after the piercing is finished, there are some precautions that you should follow.\r\n\r\nAtopic eczema is triggered by certain allergens in affected people. An exposure to a certain material could trigger eczema, could a metal such as nickel trigger eczema?\r\n\r\nScientists have researched whether nickel can cause a trigger for atopic eczema. In an experiment on 960 young girls it is found that around 13% of those who got their ears pierced, went on to develop allergic skin reactions. Of the same sample, only 1% of those who did not get their ears pierced had eczema. Similarly, in an study on 520 young Swedish men doing compulsory military service, it is found that hypersensitivity to nickel and cobalt is higher (in 8% men) among those who got piercing. In contrast only 2.7% of those who did not get their ear pierced developed eczema. In another study on 424 Norwegian schoolchildren aged between 7-12 years, 89 children had their ears pierced and 79 developed skin allergies to metallic jewellery, which is a whopping 88% of those who had their ears pierced! These studies statistically relate ear piercing consisting of nickel and cobalt to atopic eczema, and establish the metals as allergens to a significant percentage of the population.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to protect yourself from allergic reactions, first you should start by visiting your doctor for an allergen test. If you discover that you are not allergic to nickel then it should be OK to go ahead and have your ears pierced.\r\n\r\nAnother less obvious reason for skin allergies after getting ear pierced might not actually be the metal, it could be the latex gloves that are worn by the person that pierces your ear. If you believe you are allergic to latex or rubber, then you should request that the person uses a pair of gloves made out of a different material. Since children have showed very high susceptibility towards possible nickel sensitization (88% as compared to 13% among adult men) it can be seen that children are much more sensitive, and so extreme care should be taken when considering piercing your child's ears. For people suffering from diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, heart disease or hemophilia, it is important to seek your doctor's approval before even considering piercing your ears.\r\n\r\nGood skin health is far more important than just making a fashion statement. After all a face full of rash doesn't make a good fashion statement anyway! With a little precaution and restraint it is possible to prevent developing atopic eczema.",

Congratulations on a game that excludes so many devices. Maybe BMX 3 will be exclusive to just 1 specific device. Note: this is sarcasm and should not be interpreted as positive feedback.",
            "Awesome game, and no ads which is amazing. The only thing that will probably make the game a but less enjoyable is if you have a sensitive screen like me it can throw off all the tricks and landings. Other than that, there's also not many tricks. The last thing I don't like is that it sometimes doesn't count it when you complete a challenge but that might just be me. Other than that I love it so much and find it really fun 👍",
            "It is a good game but the game has all worlds money purchaseable. Wish it could have a free world. And some people who complain about the 10 jumps, read this before you say there aren't, go slow for the first 2 jumps, land on the center then fall off, then after that you can play the game normally.",
            "5 stars this game is awesome and not an absolute waste of time. Just two problems. You have to buy the different levels with real money and it sucks cos i have almost completed the first level. Also there isnt 10 jumps in the first level so you cant do the challenge. But i would recommend this game to you.",
            "All tought the controls are way better than touch grind skate, This game needs a free play mode were you can mess around. I dont want the game to end when I'm playing. I don't know why the controls in this game are so good but on touchgrind skate the controls are 🗑"

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "Umm... the graphics are not that realistic as the icon of the game. Controlling the bike is very hard. But overall the game is good but I don't recommend playing it. The concept I find is kinda boring and need more update on this game you must update the graphics . Also add an option for control sensitivity. I think this game is not going too far because if you don't update it even if it has 100 million download you will not get the the rating for the game. that's all I have to say",
            "Just started this motor cycle racing game. I will let you know how I like it after playing for awhile. So far really good. That's All Folks!!! Played first 6 tracks taking 1rst place. But now I do not have control of the bike. I went back to the first bike I started the game with. Ma quale. Still have the same problem? It's as though my phone cuts out and loss of turning ability with it. Sorry. I love the racing game. Reminds me of Moto Racer. Hope you can fix the bug.",
            "It is really good game . In bored watching movies then I think that I open play store I see this game . But I think a game will come 1 hour. So I deleted all games like that. But I installed this game there was only 10 seconds only. I think that it will be more Seconds",
            "The game is very good but it's graphic and controlling is not good. It's controling is very bad.on 100kmph it don't turn. And after modifications bike doesn't performence is not too good. Although the game is good.I suggest everyone to play this game.",
            "This game, Real Bike Racing is a good game to me. I liked this game. This game, looks little bit real to me and all are good. I have no problem with this game. I will give 3 stars. Thank you."

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "Superb game I us the best game for time pass but please only little issue that we are not able to go into the building so please upgrade the game and make us to go inside the house, building etc it's a nice game I recommend this game to everyone. And one more advice try to make it into a multi player games to make it more interesting and amazing.",
            "Great game but the map should be more big and should have an airport and a Railway Station.Please add scope.The phone from which we can take selfies should have some more apps like the app from which we can order cars and please add some mini game like in the football field we can play it (penalty shootout) and same in the basketball court. Please add headlights to the cars and bikes so that it looks even better during the night time and please add weather change. The game is awesome.😊😊😊😊",
            "I love this game so much and I will play this game only but there's some problems 1. Add snow island and volcano island 2. If we touch a police car the police officer will come and shoot why he will not arrest me 3. To tri cycle in real life to buy is ₹3000 in this game you have given 21k 4. You should increase the speed of vehicles 5. Why there is no train in this game you should add train you have made an underground metro but not train. This the problem please update I am a kid. Thank you....",
            "Would definitely recommend, although I do have some ideas, 1. Animals should be added, like deer and pets, things to shoot, like the neighbors cat. 2. Useable stores, car dealership, weapons shop, etc. 3. I don't know the extent of what y'all can do but better AI would be sweet, like making friends with the NPCs, and more missions. Also, when I collect payment from a place I own, it won't let me collect from the other places, which is annoying. But thx for the great game!",
            "This game is very interesting . But 1 problem is that we cannot sit in robot cars . And we can go in buildings . And very powerful cars with missiles and powerful bicycle with guns. And new colorful helicopters with more power. And new powerful guns . And new pare shoot with more power . And animals like horses. And we can sit on animals .And new shirts and pants. And colorful aeroplanes with missiles. New knifes with more power. And also we can drink on coffee on coffee shop and eat burger"

            "It is a very nice game. I am playing this game from a very long time , around 4 to 5 years , but now you have to pay for some customisation and for some fast cars which can only be bought through diamond . Please add more places other than city,airport ,port and off-road. There are two more modes, police chasing and another which always show coming soon . I've been waiting for those two new modes , please launch the other two modes soon.",
            "Brilliant game, love how easy it is to get cash. Just one thing though, everytime I try and resume theres an ad, could you make it like every 4 times you click resume or something. Also, some of the time trials and drift challenges are impossible to do in a normal car, like the 20,000 cash on on offroad with 31 checkpoints and 3 laps, you cant do that in 4 minutes, it's impossible without an offroad car which cost way too much. The 5,000 and 10,000 druft challenged on port are impossible too.",
            "It's been so long since I played this game and I'm so happy with how this game improved! I think I first played this game around 2015 maybe and I enjoyed it! Five years later and the graphics have improved and the game quality improved too. However, I don't like that there is now limited customization with the vehicles--nitro is one example--but I think I can pass on that. Another thing I hope to see in the future is more areas besides the airport, off-road, and the port.",
            "I have been playing this game for a very very long time now. During this time I have absolutely loved playing this game. However some minor issues ruin the best experience possible. Such as : at high speed my car will start bouncing on the road and ruin my speed records. I would really want this fixed. A cool feature would be a turbo sound ! In feed in the game the turbo only increases the speed of the car. However the sound of a turbo is always great to hear. Please add one.",
            "Actually a fairly decent game, few flaws though. The drifting challenges are very hard since they want you to learn how to drift while in a straight away..... still a really good game despite the few flaws it has. Also turn off wifi and data so you dont get ads, but the ads arent too bad if you want to keep it on. The driving does take some getting used to."

            "I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them 🙂🖕",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

            "It's satisfying, and the game has many options. Some graphics still need to be worked on, like when you're mixing slime and it sometimes starts looking squary under your finger. It should be smoother. Also, there are many ads, but you can remove them and the price is perfectly reasonable. I would recommend.",
            "I like the Game!! VERY satisfing! You can even MAKE you own slime!! You can customize the slime ANYway ya like!! You can also take a picute of yourself and it turns to slime! Also the slime makes satisfing noises! And the slime won't get ALL over that new shirt!!",
            "Umm....this is a super app with relaxing slime and all sorts of games and it is true there are too many adds but they are short and if they are long there is a option to skip already ☺️ . So that's not a problem , I recommend all to download this awesome app , those are ok with the adds then they should download this app ☺️ I'm ok with adds and those have trouble with adds then they it's not necessary to download and they adds don't come during ur play so you don't have much prob with adds,bye ☺",
