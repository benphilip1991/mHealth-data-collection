        "description": "Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body. This reaction leads to swelling and a quicker turnover of skin cells. With too many cells rising to the surface of skin, the body can’t slough them off fast enough. They pile up, forming itchy, red patches.\r\n\r\nIt can develop at any age, but usually occurs in people between 15 and 35 years old. The main symptoms include itchy, red patches of thick skin with silvery scales on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms, and feet.\r\n\r\nPsoriasis can be irritating and stressful. Creams, ointments, medications, and light therapy may help. However, some research suggests diet might also alleviate symptoms.\r\n\r\nSo far, research on diet and psoriasis is limited. Still, some small studies have provided clues into how food may affect the disease.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1969, scientists looked into a potential connection. Researchers published a study in the journal Archives of Dermatology that showed no link between a low-protein diet and psoriasis flare-ups. More recent studies, however, have found different results.\r\n\r\nHealthy diet, healthy weight\r\n\r\nDermatologists have long recommended that a healthy diet is best for those with psoriasis. That means lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. In addition, maintaining a healthy weight may provide significant relief.\r\n\r\nA 2007 study found a strong connection between weight gain and psoriasis. Having a higher waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-hip ratio were also associated with an increased risk for the disease.\r\n\r\nSo eat clean and stay lean to reduce psoriasis flare-ups.\r\n\r\n\r\nInclusive content of below topics:-\r\n\r\nFoods That Cause Psoriasis Flare-ups\r\nEating Strategies To  Soothe Psoriasis\r\nFoods That May Fight Psoriasis\r\nBest Foods to Eat to Fight Psoriasis\r\nAnti-inflammatory Diet\r\nGluten-free Diet\r\nHeart-healthy Diet\r\nVitamins and Supplements Diet\r\nWeight-loss Diet\r\nFoods to Avoid to Prevent Psoriatic Arthritis Flare-ups\r\nEssential Oils For Psoriasis\r\nScalp Psoriasis Diet\r\nPsoriasis Diet Plan\r\n\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends,family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

        "description": "SkyMD is a national telemedicine platform, specializing in dermatology, staffed with doctors that treat patients every day across America. With online dermatologists in all 50 US States, SkyMD's medical team of skin doctors is literally available to treat patients in every zip code, from infants to centenarians!\r\n\r\nOur online group of doctors operates no differently than any traditional doctor's office, other than no appointments, and your having more time to interact with your dermatologist. SkyMD accepts most medical insurances, and treats the privacy of your medical data with the utmost importance. Our medical professionals are all board certified doctors, with years of experience in treating a wide range of skin conditions and diseases.\r\n\r\nAs a group of practicing medical doctors, SkyMD also prescribes medications, the same as if you were evaluated by a doctor in person. Today's medical industry, along with State Boards of Medicine and the majority of private insurance networks, considers telemedicine as equal to being seen in person, and most medical insurance networks consider telemedicine as a covered medical benefit. Dermatology is an obvious and practical fit for the use of telemedicine. Your SkyMD doctor now has the flexibility to evaluate your uploaded photos, or converse with you in a video conference, or even recommend that you still see a doctor in person, depending on what's the right treatment model for each patient.\r\n\r\nAccess your dermatologist anytime, anywhere. SkyMD brings the dermatologist to your fingertips.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1. Download the app (for free) and connect to your dermatologist. Tell us where you live (zip code), and we will recommend a doctor to you, or you can select from any doctor in your home state.\r\n\r\n2. Take photos of your skin, hair or nail concern, and complete a medical intake comprised of a few simple questions about your primary concern, symptoms, a medical history, allergies, and anything else you'd like to tell us about your skin issue.\r\n\r\n3.

            "Update: There was a delay and I was able to get it to work. I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",
            "Great way to get prescriptions for issues already known to you. I'm sure they're helpful in diagnosing new issues as well. Definitely great for someone with a busy schedule.",
            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

            "Hi, I can't seem to see your FAQ or information about how to recover from a different phone.  I had signed up on my old phone (as it said do this so you don't loose anything when you change phones) which is now broken  now I have my new phone, but theres no Sign-in or restore and no easily accessible FAQ. please point me in the right direction or kindly tell me how to restore onto new phone",
            "Good display for cross analysis but has a limited storage space? Earlier pictures delete without notification which isnt helpful.",

            "Ive had eczema for 30 yrs. I have 2 forms of it and neither stay presented unless i have a breakout. The fact this app just lets you take photos instead of uploading them for comparison is stupid. There are 7 types of eczema and not all types remain presentnon an adults body. Please research these types and add them to your app. Otherwise this app is a waste of time. I wanted to use it to show my dermatologist the outbreaks, but nevermind now."

I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

If you do not start treatment for psoriasis, inflamed areas cover up to 50-60% of the body.\r\n\r\nThe following symptoms help distinguish psoriatic plaques from lichen or allergies:\r\n\r\nThey have clear edges, slightly thickened and rise above the skin, provoking slight swelling and redness. The scales are light almost silver.\r\nExfoliated particles are easily scraped off the surface, leaving the surface as if covered with wax.\r\nAfter removing the inflamed scales, a thin red film from new cells is visible, which glistens in the light.\r\nWhen trying to tear off the film, droplets of blood appear (Auspitz phenomenon).\r\nThese are the main signs of psoriasis that help to conduct a self-diagnosis. The first manifestations are observed at the place of rubbing with clothes, after abrasions or thermal burns, resembling non-healing wounds. But there are several options for placing papules on the patient's body:\r\nOn hands. Small foci can be localized on the fingers, crusting elbows. In rare cases or with advanced form, the process affects the forearm.\r\nOn the head. A common form is diagnosed with the appearance of particles and crusts on the scalp. Inflammation begins on the back of the head, gradually passes behind the ears, accompanied by burning and copious dandruff, resembling a crown.\r\nOn the body. With a drop-shaped form, small plaques abundantly cover the stomach, hips, and back. Often the problem is observed after treatment of infections with antibiotics.\r\nOn the palms and feet. Palmar-plantar psoriasis begins with several small plaques, but quickly grows into large areas covered with whitish skin. Sometimes itchy crusts occur only between the fingers.\r\nOn the face. A rare form with localization on the thin skin of the eyelids, around the lips with rashes on the cheeks.\r\n\r\nRecently, the number of children in whom psoriasis manifests itself long before puberty has increased. In babies, the first papules hide in the folds of the skin in the groin, axillae, on the neck. They itch, causing discomfort and loss of appetite. Parents often take them for a manifestation of atopic dermatitis.",

Plus, the tracking features make it easy for you to log your symptoms and share any changes with your doctor during office visits. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow GOtezla can help: \r\n\r\n• Get personalized information that lets you know what to expect \r\n\r\n• Track your progress with photographs, graphs, and notes to show your doctor during office visits \r\n\r\n• Treatment reminders to help make sure you don’t miss a dose \r\n\r\n• Access to nurses who’ll answer your questions 24 hours a day/7 days a week \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGOtezla was developed with the help of people who are currently taking Otezla. When you’re starting treatment, GOtezla puts the tools you need at your fingertips. \r\n \r\n\r\nAPPROVED USES \r\n\r\nOtezla® (apremilast) is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOtezla is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must not take Otezla if you are allergic to apremilast or to any of the ingredients in Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOtezla can cause severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, especially within the first few weeks of treatment. Use in elderly patients and the use of certain medications with Otezla appears to increase the risk of having diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Tell your doctor if any of these conditions occur. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOtezla is associated with an increase in depression. In clinical studies, some patients reported depression, or suicidal behavior while taking Otezla. Some patients stopped taking Otezla due to depression. Before starting Otezla, tell your doctor if you have had feelings of depression, or suicidal thoughts or behavior. Be sure to tell your doctor if any of these symptoms or other mood changes develop or worsen during treatment with Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome patients taking Otezla lost body weight. Your doctor should monitor your weight regularly. If unexplained or significant weight loss occurs, your doctor will decide if you should continue taking Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome medicines may make Otezla less effective, and should not be taken with Otezla. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSide effects of Otezla include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, runny nose, sneezing, or congestion, abdominal pain, tension headache, and headache. These are not all the possible side effects with Otezla. Ask your doctor about other potential side effects. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or planning to breastfeed. Otezla has not been studied in pregnant women or in women who are breastfeeding. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Several conditions are covered, like rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, microcrystalline arthritis (gout), lupus (SLE), osteoarthritis, etc. The benefits for the patients are numerous: reduce the frequency of visits to the rheumatologist (in agreement with the rheumatologist), detect earlier the failure/inefficacy of an ongoing treatment, and thus earlier adpatation of the therapeutic strategy. This adds up naturally to the fact that the user has an objective idea of his/her status with respect to a rheumatic condition and its evolution over time, which in itself is a benefit. The app thus really allows to follow the \"treat-to-target\" trend. This mobile application can be connected to RheumaKit.com, a web platform for personalized medicine in Rheumatology to be used by the clinicians. Each clinician can store a much larger collection of information of interest regarding each patient. The types of information that can be managed by the clinicians are related to treatment, to diagnosis or to disease activity and can include biological and even genomic testing. Currently, the mobile application allows the follow-up of the user via three self-reported metrics: the simplified Health Assessment Questionaire (HAQ-DI), the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).

        "description": "The Division of Rheumatology at the University of Cape Town is very actively involved in teaching, service delivery and research.\r\n\r\nTeaching is directed at medical students in their 4th 5th and 6th years of training. There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.<br><br>The rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

Ringworm is frequent especially among children.\r\nHowever, it may affect people of all ages\r\n\r\nRelated skin fungus infections may appear at:\r\n\r\n1. The scalp\r\n2. A man's beard\r\n3. The groin (jock itch)\r\n4. The toes\r\n5. Other places on the skin\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of Ringworm ?\r\n\r\nRingworm is produced by a group of fungi called dermatophytes which consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Epidermphyton,\r\n2. Trichophyton and\r\n3. Microsporum.\r\n\r\nThe fungal infection is mildly infectious.\r\nIt can spread by direct contact with the infected skin and scalp of infected persons, lesions on animals especially cats, contaminated floors and furniture.\r\nRingworm can passed easily from one person to another\r\nFungi are germs that can grow on the dead cells of the nails, hair, and outer layers of the skin.\r\nTinea corporis is produced by mold-like fungi called dermatophytes.\r\nTinea corporis is frequent in children, but can happen in people of all ages.\r\nFungi grow in warm, moist areas.\r\n\r\nA tinea infection tends to be present in a patient who:\r\n\r\n1. Has wet skin for a long time (such as from sweating)\r\n2. Has minor skin and nail injuries\r\n3. Do not bathe or wash the hair often\r\n4. Has close contact with other people (such as in sports like wrestling)\r\n\r\nTinea corporis can infect easily.\r\n\r\nA person can catch it if he or she comes into direct contact with an area of ringworm on someone's body.\r\n\r\nA patient can also get it by touching items that have the fungi on them, such as:\r\n\r\n1. Clothing\r\n2. Combs\r\n3. Pool surfaces\r\n4. Shower floors and walls\r\n\r\nMales are affected more than females.\r\n\r\nWhat are the Symptoms of Ringworm?\r\n\r\nSymptoms are:\r\n\r\n1. Flat ring shaped skin rash with well defined edges.\r\n\r\na. Periphery is reddish, vesicular and may be dry or scaly.\r\n\r\nb. The central area is usually clear.\r\n\r\nIf ringworm affects the hair, the patient will have bald patches.\r\nIf ringworm affects the nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.\r\n\r\n2. Itch.\r\n\r\nThe rash begins as a small area of red, raised spots and pimples.\r\nThe rash slowly becomes ring-shaped, with a red, raised rim and a pale center.\r\nThe rim may look scaly.\r\nThe rash may occur on the arms, legs, face, or other exposed body areas.\r\nThe area may be itchy.\r\n\r\nHow is Ringworm diagnosed?\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\n\r\nThe doctor can often diagnose tinea corporis by looking at the skin.\r\n\r\nThe patient may also need the following tests:\r\n\r\nExamination of a skin scraping from the rash under a microscope using a special test\r\n\r\nHow is Ringworm diagnosed?\r\n\r\n1. Physical examination shows the typical appearance of the rash.\r\n2. The fungus may glow when the skin is examined with a blue light also called a Wood's light in the dark.\r\n\r\nTests to confirm the diagnosis are:\r\n\r\n1. KOH test (potassium hydroxide) for microscopic fungal examination, in the clinic or laboratory to identify the presence of a fungal infection.\r\n\r\nThis test is performed using small flakes of skin that are examined under the microscope.\r\n\r\n2. Skin scrapings for skin biopsy and culture\r\nSkin biopsy\r\nCulture and microscopic examination of the skin is done for fungus\r\nWhat are the complications of Ringworm?\r\n\r\nTwo complications of ringworm are:\r\n\r\n1. Skin infection from scratching too much\r\n2. Other skin disorders that require further treatment such as secondary bacterial infections with cellulitis and lymphangitis.\r\n\r\nLymphadenitis may occur especially in diabetic patients\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENT\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nChapter 1: \"I've Got Ringworm?

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas.

Some of the functions don't work at all (adding insurance info), the photo upload feature was an absolute nightmare, and final payment redirects to the jankiest built-in web browser I've ever seen.

            "It would be helpful if multiple joints could be selected at the same time when logging symptoms, sometimes when dexterity is more limited, selecting the individual joints and manually documenting is difficult. A food diary would be great too, too track things like gluten, dairy and nightshades",
            "There's a pop up or a bug that is making editing previous days rather difficult. I like this app otherwise. I'd also like to copy and paste symptoms from previous days or copy symptoms from one side and paste it to the other side. I typically have the same issues in both sides and it would be nice to save me extra taps."

Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together.

Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

        "description": "This app Color Atlas of Skin Diseases - Dermatology Atlas is for medical student, doctors, dermatologist, nurses and other health practitioners to understand Dermatology Atlas with Treatment. The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nDon't forget to share it with other doctors.",

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

Boosters and other extra materials of the game you can get in daily gift or buy in store.\" is BS! Who is testing these games? The time levels especially the ice cream levels takes so many tries to beat. The time shouldn't start until the people order shows. The coins should be used for boosters or gems. Addictive but NOT WORTH IT!",
            "This started off very well. But then it was frustrating as the booster were impossible to get and the upgrades were way to expensive. I just wanted to play a game where you do not have to pay to get stuff. This is just not right.",
            "Levels are hard to pass without boosts or added time too soon...they want you to spend money ... just like most of these free cooking games. I enjoy the game and the graphics but I don't enjoy it enough to spend money on it.... time to find a new game again.",
            "This game is insane. I make the food and it wont let me click it to serve it to the customer. Im on level 250 or something. And this just started. Its very frustrating. Very disappointed because i enjoyed this game. Ige checked for updates and have even deleted and re downloaded the game. Still wont work properly."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match.

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

I will just dislike you more. Oh god cut it out already! And again! Stop! Yet again? You're wasting your advertising budget. And again, you waste your ads. Your advertising system is cheating you, theu show your ads to the same people over and over again. No new people at all.",
            "I really like this game, but at level 25, there is no warning, difficulty does not increase, they just stop giving you goals to proceed, and the game is over. You can harvest all day, but you're not progressing any more. Also, the ad with the big long harvest blade is false advertising, you never see it. It was a fun game, but sadly lacking in the end.",
            "This is disturbingly addicting. I cant stop playing for some reason. I do have a slight issue with the controls, though. Sometimes it feels too sensitive, and sometimes it seems to turn in the opposite direction of where it want it to go. Also, time extension bonuses would be a wonderful addition. I feel bummed out when I'm so close to getting a personal goal, but im cut short by a few seconds.",
            "I love this game but it froze up. This is the second time. I had to delete it and reload the game. I,m not doing it again. No other game has done ever this! You get to level 25 and I guess thats it!! GAME Same old same old from then on. Done it, good bye, hope they expand it was fun.",
            "This game is SOOOO MUCH FUN. Its not got that many ads as others are saying it has. Its a good way to pass time but my only problem is sometimes when time is over it asks me if i want 2x more than i earned and i pressed \" no thanks \" but it still gave me an unskippable add. This has only happened 2 or 3 times so it doesnt ruin the overall game. Still 5 stars🤗"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

It is to small to put the photo of my face inside. I would like it if you make it bigger. And when I cut the persons hair, it is messy. Please make this game better.",

This is a challenge for the 3 year old as the ads messes up her game play. I'm one of those people who will purchase a game to remove ads and sadly, that doesn't appear to be an option.",

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you.

            "Game is very greedy, but fun. Stingy, but fun. Hard to become good. Cost a fortune or a lifetime to get a competitive player. Season pass is very stingy. 6 months of playing and you still will be average in stats. Game is very fun. But I spent $16 and have played for months and I have a long way to go. Game is fun but the creators are the greediest Ive evr seen. Could be one of the best ever, but your kids will learn what being Robbed feels like! Enjoy",
            "The game is entertaining sure.. but the controls are absolutely horrible! Half the time, it doesn't respond well, especially during the goalkeeing.. therefore losing the match.. fix this issue. Edit: Forget about what I said about it being entertaining! It's not!! How can it be when the whole game is rigged at higher levels..",
            "THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! Do NOT get this game unless you want to be scammed out of coins you bought from your own money. I am barely on level 3 and im constantly going against players who are like level 20. Also whenever try to block a kick it keeps somehow going through my hands like im some kind of ghost. And, whenever i do the 400 coin game it charges me 500 COINS instead of 200! I do not reccomend this game.",
            "Addictive game but annoying as hell when you're put up against someone who's player has so much power in their shot it makes it nearly impossible to save. And when you play against someone on shooting race, sometimes your opponent resets for the next kick so much faster than you do (somehow) you cant win because they're 2 shots ahead of you!",
            "Paid $4.99 for VIP to 3rd Season Anniversary Cup yesterday. Game suddenly restarted in the final match. After restart, lost all VIP benefits. Later a Gold Cup was added to my account... Were is my VIP winner's green striped jersey and other winner's prizes? If you charge real money, test your product! The same issue happened before. That's why I didn't purchase anything extra for the game for a long time. Seems like nothing has changed on your side. That's sad."

            "I remeber about 5 or so years ago this game was really differant, but don't take that the wrong way, the skins now are really cool and the map almost seems larger! The only thing I would change is to add back some of the old skins, because I thought they were fun and that way you would get more of a variety, because now there isnt as many skins as there used to be, and you have to play, ALOT to get some of the new skins, but this game is super cool and really addictive!",
            "Well, sadly, it used to be 5 stars and not loads of ads. I changed it to 3 stars after there were way too much ads and not only too much, there started to be gross, bloody, inmature ads that is not good for a kid to watch. I feel like now that I wrote a good 5 star review a few days ago about good ads, the developer thinks that I will be ok with the types of ads now. Its fine most of the time but I had to write a bad review after there was an ad that had bees stinging ladys and showing blood.",
            "This game is really good but I played it a few years ago and it was way better of course it's a good game but the skins a few years ago were better and didn't have to unlock them also I thought of was more free or something, I think that's just me though. This is a good game though and I love it ❣️",
            "I like this game . Its a wonderful game because while starting we will be small and while killing others and we will get longer and longer so I love this game .. so....…. Come on and download this game and start. Play but we cant able to play this game in online . But this is a good game to play. So… I like this game 🤗🤗🤗 and my high score is 14000. This was new. Game i was happy",
            "I love his very addictive fun exciting game, however I would of gave it a 5 if the ads where tuned down a bit, I mean too many ads and it would be better and more fun if there was only like 1 ad for 5 games, I would love it, but gotta say I love the new update.👉👈"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. 🧚🌼👼👼. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too. I was in search of such game these days I keep downloading games and after 1hr or so I delete them I am never satisfied with games but this game is so amazing. 😘🤩🤩"

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

Also, the gameplay is easy and the targets are interesting. Oh, and a voice telling how many points you get from each arrow is nicely unusual.

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It do help a bit while trying to manage your Instagram account but it's quite limited on what you can do. I can't export my whitelist to use it with a script or another app. And the automated unfollow method is dumb. We don't have a way to customize how it is going to work. There's no way you can report problems or contact the developer inside the app, which is a bummer. We can't sync the list of people that unfollow the profile you tracking. There's room to improve this app.",
            "Much better than the original. I switched from this to a professional paid software for a few years. But since the changes insta made I got rid of the automation. I like that it doesn't scrape everything everytime you go on the app. And that you can now do it manually. Tip 1: Use 4g/5g Tip 2: Do it manually(click image and unfollow inside insta app) Tip 3: Dont do too many at once. Maybe 20 max and spread it over the day Tip4: Dont scan too many times. Try to restrict this to 1 or two at most.",
            "Absolutely very helpful app. I was doing these tasks through code but then came across it . Giving one star less because the \"Auto\" functionality stops working after one or two uses and I think that is because Instagram blocks those actions. Will give 5 stars on the day developers are able to disguise Instagram 😉. UI can be improved but I can live with it. Thanks developers.",
            "TURN OFF WIFI AND IT'LL WORK. All you have to do is turn off Wi-Fi and it will work perfectly. No complaints once I figured this out. I was having the same problems as all of you until I forgot to turn my Wi-Fi back on today and all of a sudden I was able to unfollow 50 at a time over and over. You have to wait 8 minutes once you reach 200 unfollowers otherwise Instagram will flag you as a bot but after 8 minutes you could go ahead and do it again.",
            "I give it 5 star because According to me, this is the best app i have seen for our insta id, some times it gets bugs but after some time it is again in work,it gives us features like Followers, Unfollowers of your id, and many mores, you can log in 1 or more id's at same time, but i request to the developers to remove the bugs from the app, because it's irritating and One of the best feature of this app is - No Adds😍"

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",
        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

I should be able to delete my stuff. It is my stuff to delete if I want to. Played both versions and it is not so friendly to f2p. I mean I thought it to be a real RTS but not nearly close.",
            "Too many potty mouth kids INSULTING each other and PLAYERS without any reaction from developers on report. Stopped playing, uninstalled. It's basically like any other PAY game. The more MONEY you spend, the more you can HARASS others. Not the most elaborate strategic war games I've seen but its ok. Gets a little boring with all the waiting around. Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",
            "It's a good game. But still needs some adjustments. Like, it unecessarily cuts my 1500 game golds in the name of HQ transportation, when I tried to transport it to a nearest place of my guild member. After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries. I mean, which type of game is this when I am unable to help my team members, couldn't arrange a rally or be a part of it? Seriously, a lot more work is required to improve this game.",

As far as I can tell, there are very minor differences, such as you can't choose the United Kingdom, Helena isn't available in the beginning, and Pandora is now Chimera (though a lot of the spoken dialogue still references Pandora). Really lazy re-skin, but that music makes all of the difference. Stick with KoW is you've put any significant time in it, otherwise play this for the awesome music. Oh, and zombies!"

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "Limited moves,too much money to keep up w/ game you can't plsy ,2out of 3 only 1set at s time. The makers off this game did a really good job at first.but i beat the game without spending money but when you get to the top you play against a supper bot you can't go around over or away it won't let me and blocks are happens out of the blue you designed a game that was indestructible.but i kicked you ass and so you can win .that is full shi_ and your game needs to cheat so you can't win 0 stars.",
            "Interesting but wayyy too slow paced. Theres not enough players online so it take forever to match up in multiplayer to earn coins and the \"story mode\" has a waiting time for every match which is wayyy to long. Both of these make earning credits too hard in the game which makes it too slow to progress and increase your skill in the game. Developers should add another way to earn credits that doesnt have a limit or waiting time.",
            "Ya very good appl. If u are interested in volleyball. It has one most worst point in which it allows to play only at when time arrived in case of offline and another point is that in case of online playing u player won't come soon it Will take lots of time and sometimes it won't connect also.",
            "It's a really fun game If it had more specific players like a libero, a setter n ace then it would be amazing also make getting coins easier if it's through ads or weekly packs n stuff then it will definitly be a 5 star game i really hope you add these features cuz it'll be truly awsome!",

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "I will not recommend to download this App for anyone. Surely it does not match the most accure sounds with their real animals like, look it, Rhinoceros and Wolf sounds there is big different with their real sounds and ones in this app even Zebra and dog, and others still not accurate sounds. Too fake the sound of Mosquitoes. Totally it's misleading one avoid it. For me I will not recommend this for anyone.!"

            "Superb game I us the best game for time pass but please only little issue that we are not able to go into the building so please upgrade the game and make us to go inside the house, building etc it's a nice game I recommend this game to everyone. And one more advice try to make it into a multi player games to make it more interesting and amazing.",
            "Great game but the map should be more big and should have an airport and a Railway Station.Please add scope.The phone from which we can take selfies should have some more apps like the app from which we can order cars and please add some mini game like in the football field we can play it (penalty shootout) and same in the basketball court. Please add headlights to the cars and bikes so that it looks even better during the night time and please add weather change. The game is awesome.😊😊😊😊",
            "I love this game so much and I will play this game only but there's some problems 1. Add snow island and volcano island 2. If we touch a police car the police officer will come and shoot why he will not arrest me 3. To tri cycle in real life to buy is ₹3000 in this game you have given 21k 4. You should increase the speed of vehicles 5. Why there is no train in this game you should add train you have made an underground metro but not train. This the problem please update I am a kid. Thank you....",
            "Would definitely recommend, although I do have some ideas, 1. Animals should be added, like deer and pets, things to shoot, like the neighbors cat. 2. Useable stores, car dealership, weapons shop, etc. 3. I don't know the extent of what y'all can do but better AI would be sweet, like making friends with the NPCs, and more missions. Also, when I collect payment from a place I own, it won't let me collect from the other places, which is annoying. But thx for the great game!",
            "This game is very interesting . But 1 problem is that we cannot sit in robot cars . And we can go in buildings . And very powerful cars with missiles and powerful bicycle with guns. And new colorful helicopters with more power. And new powerful guns . And new pare shoot with more power . And animals like horses. And we can sit on animals .And new shirts and pants. And colorful aeroplanes with missiles. New knifes with more power. And also we can drink on coffee on coffee shop and eat burger"

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",
            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "This game is focused on making its players worse whenever a player gets knocked out he cant get up he needs to spend gems coins or watch a ad but whenever a bot gets knocked out he gets super fast this, games last no more than 45 seconds and the graphics could better i think if they used there money from their ads and chagnged the game up it could be better but from now on i wont reccomond this game to friends",
            "this game would be getting a lot more 5 stars if it wasn't for those damned ads. i got an ad on loading screen on my 1st game. if only the devs weren't so greedy, then it would be a really good fighting game for mobile phone. but on it's current state though, i wouldn't recommend because of the egregious monetisation.",
            "It's all around a decent game but the dodge button and the training buttons for example for speed the hit boxes are too small If you don't hit them dead center it won't register I have lost and almost lost plenty of matches just because the dodge button didn't register",
            "Was good until for some unknown reason in Tournament mode can only use one arm, and even if I win the match using only one arm instead of advancing in the tournament, I go backwards not forward In regular game play both left and right punches can be thrown, what a load of horse sh*@",
            "It seems it doesn't even know simple addition dropping it down from a 2 to a one. Visually pleasing however the fights are really underwhelming. This could be a good game if you try to make it one however it seems that you just dont want to try."

        "description": "Skin Disease Treatments provides medical treatments info including rosacea. \r\nPeople say that beauty’s only skin deep; it’s what’s on the “inside” that counts. Our insides are certainly important, but skin treatment is your first layer of defense against the outside world. Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin can keep taking good care of you. \r\nSkin protects your body in many ways. The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health.\r\n\r\nSkin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nYour skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There’s a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.\r\n\r\nMany skin researchers are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping your skin healthy can't be overemphasized. It's the body's first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.\r\n\r\nSkin conditions can affect anyone—young and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist—a physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy—may be in order. Don’t use this guide for main diagnose medical books. Skin problems can be difficult to diagnose because many skin conditions share similar symptoms. An evaluation is key to effective treatment.",

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "This is silly.. this is not a battle royal just like shown on the top and not even a survival game wherein you can play with real players.. this is a level up game in which you will kill all bots with a colleague bot as well.. and after every round, a feustrating ad will pop up and you dont have the choice to close until it was finished. Not recomended",
            "This game is one of the worst gun game ever. I hate this game you can't even use a scope and you paly with bots and war again boots. this is foolishness and the maker of this game knows that, that's why they put a good looking display picture art to capture the people. Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!😠",
            "The game's is trick because the is not same at the photo because of that i give one star. At first i wanted to give 5 start , but if 's like this don't expect to get 5 start . I hate this game 's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "Well...They lied about the images of the gameplay and they said its an 3d shooting game and in the pictures it looks 3d and it looks different from the actual gameplay..they make money when someone downloads this app so please read the reviews carefully and only download it when its the game youre looking for",
            "The game is good but one thing in this game you will get nothing what you have see in the picture... Above all the graphics, game pley is good so i love it. (Bangladesh)"

I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

I use four fingers to play my games and this game is forcing me to use two thumbs and the area where the aiming and shooting are bundled with features to add on to are sometimes pressed by mistake when you don't need them.

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

I honestly dont mind the ads, most of the time they're just skip able pictures unlike other apps with 30 second non-skip able clips. Thank you for making this app! 💝",
            "Ok at first but then I couldn't even choose a picture to erase the backround from. Im trying to renstall it. It didn't work. About a month later I reinstall it and after another 15 uses the same thing happened. I have to keep reinstalling it because when I choose the file it closes every one in a while . But it gets another star from last time I used it.",
            "Background Eraser is a great app! if you use the auto setting while erasing you can very easily erase the backround of a photo. but there is a downside, for some reason the adds that pop up are too big and I can't click off them, and the only way is to get off the add, is to close the app and restart. Is there anyway to fix this?",
            "Its really good! I love how its really easy and has the right tools for me,( im sorry if i dont spell right its my broken keybored) but theres one problem, when im done removing the background for a video, it just kicks me out. And also the ads, there are to many, ( sorry if im annoying) but i love ghe app so far! Keep up to work! :3",
            "Its good but there is to many ads,i would give it a 4 but theres way to many ads please fix the ads problem,but if it doesnt i might have to give it a 2 or a 1 if this gets better i will give it a 5 or either a 4 star that is all,but other than that its nice ..just please fix it"
