            "The app is good. It's a good place to make skins and find bases for your own personal use, but it got rid of one of it's features recently and I can't tell if that's a bug on my part or a purposeful update. I can't open it straight from minecraft to import my skins, so I have to download my skins into my gallery first now. It's a little annoying considering how it used to be. If they fix that though, that'll be a solid 5 stars for me.",
            "After the new android phone update a while ago, there's been a lot of glitches, I tried dealing with it thinking an update to fix it will come but it's not, every time I make a skin and press the tick button it says \"saved\" at the bottom of the screen but it doesn't come out of the skin and freezes, you need to leave and close the app to use it again, there's lots of other glitches like that, it's really annoying and inconvenient and it would help if it was fixed",
            "This app is so easy. There is a selection of more than 1,000 skins, and they're so easy to import and export onto your Minecraft game. You can even customize your own skins, and search for other peoples' skins. I give this a four-star review because there are a couple bugs but the only one I really know of is that sometimes I cannot find my skin I imported into to Minecraft. It may just be my issue but some of the skins I really like I cannot find in the skins area for Minecraft.",
            "I like this app but the only thing i would want is a bucket/fill tool. The painter gets a little too small for big canvases like the 128 by 128 skins. But other than that, I like how you can put decriptions on your skins and even talk to your followers. One last piece advice is if in the communites, you can label what genre your skin is. All of these comments are maybe just ideas to go off of when trying to make a cool feature in a new update or something like that. Yes this app is very #good",
            "This app is good and I recommend installing it. A lot of skin maker apps before where hard to use, laggy or Minecraft would say it doesn't work. But this one works very well it can lag at times but there aren't many times it does. I really love how you get to make your own, or edit someone else's."

            "This app is amazing! I had so much fun playing this app. Its the best editor for your skin. if you can't find one online that looks like you or, a character you want. you can make it here! The ads aren't annoying, they just come sometimes. If you want a dream character make it here! It's amazing I've never came to an app that is this incredible! Its fun, easy to edit, and more! I love this app. I'm impressed! And I just can't, its so so.... good! Best minecraft skin editor I've even seen.♡~♡",
            "hands down, best skin editor. My only problems is that there isn't a tool to mirror the pen to the other arm/leg. If you could add a tool that enables that, that would be great. Also, the ads aren't too annoying, but it should just be when you save or make a new skin, not after a certain amount of taps on tools. Overall, it's great, but there could be some improvements made.",
            "I mean, this is really a flawless app. It loads fast, the user interface is easy to use yet detailed enough, and I've yet to come across something at all annoying. The one thing I say this could have is an option to see your skin with the arms out or in a walking pose, but this isn't really that necessary and can be done in the MCPE app anyway.",
            "The app itself is nearly great but....it's missing an important feature and that is the \"noise mode\" where you can add multiple color palettes on a selected body part of a minecraft skin without having to change the color very frequently. Just in case if you don't know developers, it's a feature that is present inside the website of planet minecraft's skin editor. And to wrap it all up, what i'm trying to say is that please, you guys should add that functionality in this application. Thank you.",
            "I gotta say this is one of the best editor for skins so far..but I wish I could edit it. And by that I mean like giving some highlights, or hardcore shading? I always wanted that since I saw some people that have detailed eyes when I saw their minecraft skin. I don't know if this will happen but it's overall a good app to edit your minecraft skin."

Lots of maps too. If u are a minigame",
            "This skin selector app is soooooooooo cool if u download on a skin it says error but go to minecraft then profile and skins go to the top button and click and click the next one until u go to gallery then go to rare albums and go to minecraft skins etc. Then u select the skin u want and walla u have it!!!!!!! So cooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Then download it on gallery and open Minecraft then you have to go to profile then click on edit character and then click on owned then click on import button then click on gallery then go to the picture you saved the n you will come to Minecraft again and click on import again and you will get your skin..😘😘😘😻😻",

            "When I click save on a skin the app pulls up a playable ad for a game except there's no way out of that ad. There's no x to click on and playing the ad doesn't make it go away and instead gives you a button that takes you to some url that's not even for downloading said game. I can't get past this stupid ad so the skin editor app is useless for me if I can't save anything. Would give 0 stars if I could.",

So if that was added into this app (the functionality of putting a layer on their sleeves or legs), it would be a five-star . Nice app to customize your character anyways!",

            "This is a great app, I recommend it. I would've given 5 stars but the only problems are that there are toooo many adds! Like every time I click a skin it shows me an add, when I download it, it shows me an add and when I click off it shows me an add! The other problem is that I have had this app for a few days now and I haven't seen any update in skins... the same old ones that I saw before... Really hope the creators see to this and I wish this review is helpful to all reading this! 🙂",
            "This app is really great all but there are too many ads. This app is works. All the skins are really great it is heard to choose 1 skin. I liked all the skins they give. So i rate 5 stars for this. I appreciate the hardwork for make such great skins. Try this app this really works and this app really deserve 5 star rating.",
            "Thanks a lot, game... for giving me the cutest new avatar ever! All of the outfits work really well and the best part is that, though you may be sceptical now, when you log in then you have an amazing avatar that you can show off to all your new friends. Why do you have new friends, you ask? Because everyone LOVES your new avatar!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩",
            "This app is very VERY good!! How to use- instead of exporting it straight to Minecraft, save it to gallery. Then open minceaft and click in your avatar. Click on edit avatar and when you do that there should be an icon at the top of some characters walking, click on that then press the grey person in your screen. Then at the bottom of your screen it should say upload or something like that. Press that and select the photo that you downloaded from this app. And there you have it 😂✌️",
            "I love all the skins and there is one for anyone. The only thing is, because there are so many I think it would be nice if they could be sorted by color or if they are formal, or any filter so that a user does not need to scroll through all of the thousands of skins to find the one they like."

This is why I only have 4 stars it would have five if what happened last i had the app when it worked still worked.",
            "Okay so this is great I left on star out tho because this has to many ads but other than that it's great but one more thing I don't like how it plays ads everytime I get a skin but other than that it's great keep up the good work in the game and mabey you could make it to were all the skins don't play an ad I will appreciate it but keep up the good work 😊",
            "I think its really good! The skins are so cute! Tho i think there's a bit too much ads, if the ads were to be a bit less, i would be very happy!",
            "I love it! The skins is sooo cute..BUT soo many ads hope to fix it but i still love it so i gave it 4 stars!",
            "I absolutely recommend this app. But the only issue i have is when i get a skin which needs an ad to get, it says: \"No ads yet, try again later.\" This really annoys me because the cute skins needs an ad to watch. Other than that i really like it. Please fix this bug!"

            "OK first of all THIS app deserves zero stares and idk why it even most people get this app like really people??? Anyway with the point IT SAYS baby app when it's a not really good because the baby's r not 3D and the baby's that r 3D r adults or Adult size baby's and that not normal for a baby!!!!! So I recommend u not downloading this app and trust me do not download!!!! Well have a good day people. :L",

Look, if I am enjoying the app, and I like it, do not ask me to rate the app. It just ruins the game, and so do ads, i do realise you need to put some ads to make money for a living, but not this many, ads are going to make us NOT want the app or game advetised.",
            "Just one star for now. 😒 When I'm done downloading my favorite one I opened my Minecraft and then I am going to see all of my skins and when I pressed back button seconds later it said failed to load character 2 and of course I had no choice but to delete it I just don't understand it. But the skins are kinda good",
            "This app is very cool! Even the skins are cool but theres a problem why im clicing on the trial minecraft on my ps4 and when i click the gallery why theres an add thats why giving this app 4 stars",
            "Ads ads it's annoying when I open it a ad co as and then when install the skin it makes ads guys disclamer: for players that app is ruining every single moment that app is useless",
            "For some people that are struggling with ads don't let the developer down, you must be grateful that he/she made this app. Do you even know how to create this kind of application, if you don't then don't let the developer down. And btw GREAT APP!!"

            "Not that bad, the skins were adorable and trendy. But after downloading two skins, I opened Minecraft and they literally weren't there. It wasn't because a tab was already open or anything, I opened a different tab after downloading the skins. But all in all, this is a pretty cool app.",

When I saved my skin to minecraft it only saved half of it. When you use the default skins to start with, you can't get under the arms and it shows when the character walks. It also randomly made me leave the app without saving. One more thing. The back button is way too hard to control. Sometimes it deletes one color, sometimes everything.",

I can't edit the skin I have in my gallery i wanted to edit.. it's a regular minecraft skin i used 3.) I cannot find the info i need to how to use this app This app is not usable for me and for anyone who knows what I'm talking about..please fix?",
            "Boy! Did this shock my friends, this app is helpful for Minecraft. But there are bugs. First, when exporting, it starts deleting my exports, sometimes. Next, when editing, it starts kicking me out from the app. Last, if I used colors. For example, when I used red, it changes to blue, then black. But still super cool to use. That's when I give it 4 ☆'s. Fix this app plz. Thanks!",

Me and my friend use that app, and were using the skin, and that's the only thing connected to it, so this has to be a virus. Uninstall now and pray for your Minecraft worlds. This isn't spam but we don't know which app did this.",
            "So cute! But it need more Skins and this app let me resume watching ads.. But it's BRILLIANT App!!! Ever! I can't stop collecting Skins FROM IT!!!! I like this app a lot!!:))",
            "I don't like this app at all, do you ever fix your game? Because, my problem is that I have strong connection AND it won't load anything. I would give you 4 STARS! But since everybody is enjoying this app but not me, and also not fixing it. THEN ITS DOWN TO 1 STAR REVIEW! I am not going to change it, you can keep this review if you like. But I am totally done with this app, THATS IT! I am un installing this app FOREVER! What a bummer, your game was TRASH anyways.",

But i really do wish that we have a option to make it portrait because i am not used to a landscape skin editor. But all in all its the number one editor to use! 😊 Id love to see the developers and the apps grow!",
            "This app does not work if you're going to use a skin that is HD and u have to mahe the skin on ur own or it is just the fact that I am on a phone but anyway this app is not good I would gave give it half star but idk how to.",
            "So after a developer responded to my previous review witch i wrote some updates ago i decide to reinstall the app and i can say, i was pleasantly surprised. Easier to use than before and what i really liked is that in the premade skins section, you could finally find good skins. It really shows that they do infact read the reviews and improve on what the people want. (Looking back, my last review was kinda disrespectful. My apologies)",
            "It took so long for me to find a app/game to make my own Minecraft skin and now I found it. This app/game is awesome, if you don't have it 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GET IT NOW' ♡♡♡ Yes their are alot of ads ,buuutt if you have the time to wait, get it(You can also put your Wi-Fi or data of then you don't get ads♡) ;)",
            "I've been waiting for this since I first discovered the original. Making HD skins was so hard prior to this. The long wait for the skin to load is worth it. For anyone looking for a good skin editor for HD, this is a really good choice."

            "I really like the user interface, super easy to use. The app also allows you to choose if you want to edit in 2D or 3D, which I find really usefull. Another amazing feature is you can directly go to skin part which you want to edit, like go straight to the left arm or right leg, etc. which can save a lot of time.",
            "This is absolutely absurd! The only thing you can do is just fill up your skin collection. And the thing is, you can't even export your skins to Minecraft without paying. Also, most of the items are locked. Please don't waste your on this absolute trash since there are other skin editors available for download that are free and you don't have to pay just to export your masterpeice to Minecraft.",
            "Skin Editor Tool for Minecraft is really awesome. I can edit with two methods like 2D & 3D. It's very easy to use. I am really satisfied with this app. Working really well. It's graphical view is awesome. I liked it very much.",
            "Great app, I can work with the all so easily & doing that edit so smoothly , though it has some bugs , u should get an update removing those bugs & that will cause more smoothness of this app. In short nice app & want to see some updates that will make the app nicer..",
            "Thanks for sharing the skin editor app. The internal function of this app is so easy and fast to use. It was need for me. Thanks a lot of the developers and also thanks for sharing the app."

            "After I posted a few skins it wouldn't let me post any more skins. I tried to uninstall it but when I reinstalled it I still couldnt post skins and it still had my acount. I think it's a pretty good game though. Just can you please fix that problem? ;)",
            "Good game. But can we even use it as a character in minecraft? And if we can't, is there a way for you to make the app in such a way that we can play as the character we created?",
            "Awesome app for making minecraft skins. my favorite tool s the lightbulbs that let u darken and lighten the foundation color wherever on the skin template. also i love the feature that lets u expand the skin paper thin, instead of 3D."

            "An amazing app! Very simple to use with a lot of features one may need. Unfortunately, there are a few problems I've found. In the texture pack creator it is almost impossible to accurately change any of the long ones (e.g. fire) as they are too small. I would like for a zoom-in feature. Second, when you change textures and save them there's no way to reset to the original texture. Third and final, I would like for an option to mark a texture as complete to know if I've changed it or not.",
            "I really love this app Its a simple way to make your own texture packs. But there's some stuff that are essential but not in the app. For example we need a reset button, because lets say u edit a block and then u don't like it, well u won't be able to undo it after u save it. And two we need a zoom in feature, because some items the pixels are so small we actually can't see a thing. If u can fix this then thank you, I appreciate it.",
            "The app is very fun, entertaining, but also time consuming. I do have three down sides to it. One, from my experience there is no way to reset a texture that you drew on, two, you can't create textures for mobs, and for some reason erasing the bottom of pants and shoes doesn't work when you try to implement it. But over all great app",
            "I love this app because it lets you create a custom world to your liking. There are a few things its missing though. 1.It needs to be able to uptdate because you cant change a few things like the bed or leaves. 2. Add a zoom in option because some of the things are hard to change because of the tiny size. 3. Add a back button so that the block or item can go back to the origonal design even when you save it. Thank you for reading.",
            "great app, Ive used this on my phone to make textures and its great and all, but theres a few problems, its not updsted 1.16 (idk how long it takes or if theyll just update 16 and 17 same time) also there should be a way to download pack to file instead of just minecraft"

            "i downloaded the app hoping to make some skin packs, but whenever i tap on \"my packs\" my app freezes and it says \"Skin Pack Maker for Minecraft has stopped working\". it is impossible for me to make a skin pack. and to top that off, there are WAY too many ads. im fine with a few, but every tap i make an ad pops up.",
            "I would definitely recommend this app :: This is the first app that is useful for making skin packs and is very easy to use. But I hope you can a feature where you can remove the skin you added on the skin pack, so that you can unput some skins you accidentaly put in the pack. But still.. Thank You For Making Such Useful App",
            "It is a good app. I can make a skin packs here. It works slightly. But there is a problem. My skin is 128×128 pixels. But I cannot import it. It says you only support 64×64 pixels. Can you please upgrade it to 128×128 pixels? I still using this app.",
            "It's useful when you have too many skins but multipixel skin(128×128) doesn't work. I mean people this days usual make skin more pixelated so if it supports multipixelated skin then this app will be more useful",
            "I agree to Fantasy Fang and Fernando Yabo. Please read our review!!!!!!! I will rate you 5 if you update this app. 128x128 is my skin and you should also edit mode the skin pack (for example, if you want to change and delete your skin or you want to add more skin (probably you should put 4 or more slots) you should put it all in one not 3 skin only. Please 😠!!!!! Read our review!!!!!!"

            "I would definitely recommend this app :: This is the first app that is useful for making skin packs and is very easy to use. But I hope you can a feature where you can remove the skin you added on the skin pack, so that you can unput some skins you accidentaly put in the pack. But still.. Thank You For Making Such Useful App",
            "It is a good app. I can make a skin packs here. It works slightly. But there is a problem. My skin is 128×128 pixels. But I cannot import it. It says you only support 64×64 pixels. Can you please upgrade it to 128×128 pixels? I still using this app.",
            "It's useful when you have too many skins but multipixel skin(128×128) doesn't work. I mean people this days usual make skin more pixelated so if it supports multipixelated skin then this app will be more useful",
            "I agree to Fantasy Fang and Fernando Yabo. Please read our review!!!!!!! I will rate you 5 if you update this app. 128x128 is my skin and you should also edit mode the skin pack (for example, if you want to change and delete your skin or you want to add more skin (probably you should put 4 or more slots) you should put it all in one not 3 skin only. Please 😠!!!!! Read our review!!!!!!"

Plus, it is possible to make your own minecraft mods like this. If you are even smart enough to develope the cat ears and tail mods. Make sure the mod is compatible with other mods. I usually play Tlauncher minecraft on PC mostly. Btw, it is free to play and you can download mods for free if you sign up and log in. By: Toxicnater22",
            "If you want people get this u need to make it free u only geting one star so make free nobody is paying for 20 dollar like thats high this is the worst if u made this game with out the money it will be better u just made it with u no nobody's going to pay so why did u think that u should u that so if u want people give u five star u need to make it freei had to put a lot of words",
            "It don't works and it is a 3 day trial after that you need to pay 22 dollar a week for it so I dont think this is great I just isn't,t worth it",

        "comments": [
            "Nice app but has room to grow. The skin analysis camera doesn't take the picture in the way it says to align your face. It doesn't identify spots, pores, or wrinkles correctly. This needs fixed. Another option would be the ability to upload pictures you already have for the skin analysis. This would be helpful. I've read some tips that pop up like, don't apply toner on your pimple but it doesn't say why. I do like the app design and layout. I like that I can track my skin and my products.",
            "Used this app for almost a year and it doesn't deliver on promises such as correct identification of spots, pores and implementing the reward system with those points they use that are still useless. Needs more product recommendation, routine recommendation as well.",
            "This is honestly the best. I had no idea what to do with my skin care till I came upon this app!! It allows you to take a picture of your skin then it anylises it and tells you the biggest concern that is happening to your skin. You then also get to set a skin care goal and change as you please, overall this is a really great app! Great Job Troveskin!!",
            "Yes, it's excellent they provided good advice on how to take care of the skin as well as they recommend products based on the issue you are having mainly on the face and they do this by quizzes.",
            "I like the concept of this app! As someone whose skin is a constant change, it will be beneficial for me to track my skin and see what were items that worked and made my skin look better vs what didn't. It's fairly easy to gain points, but at this time no rewards are showing for me to redeem, so I'm curious about that. Overall, it's been a good experience."

There are enough skins that I think it should have a search bar (it doesn't) but still not enough variety. I don't think skins are HD. The app is not very user friendly. I don't know if the skin actually works in Minecraft because I haven't tested that yet, but it should do. Positives include non-intrusive ads (omnipresent, but small) and not much else. TBC...",

I pressed instal and it said to restart minecraft i wasnt in minecraft yet so i went in and the skin i clicked on was on me! It didnt have a custom cape but the skin didnt have a cape so i cant blame them for that, if it doesnt work for you i dont know what to say but that it worked for me!",

            "it's really good, but it has a downside!! So I really like it, but it has a lot of fake Minecraft Five Nights At Freddy's skins! and there is NO LOLBIT!!! I'm really sad about that because she is my favorite character. And you don't have correct Puppet, and you don't have Baby or Funtime Freddy! You can't forget Bonbon too! This is my personal major problem, but ppl may not know the YouTuber Minecraft Five Nights At Freddy's ! Also check them out they are really good! but please fix this!! :3",
            "With only limited skins and some locked, I cant give a high rating. I found some skins I couldn't find with other apps, so that's good. Over all 2 out of 5 stars. Please expand and categorize the skins and it will improve alot.",

            "It is great but after a while it stopped working so Im re-downloading it. Im happy with it but I rated it 2 stars because of the malfunction were it would shut down oppon one click. I payed for it then and it not doesnt work on my divice Update: it seems that the app doesnt work on samsung devices anymore. Ive always had problems but now it doesnt work I have uninstalled the app and will hope to get it on another device in the future.",
            "It's a good app for making custom skins. Definitely worth the money. However, there is a small issue. Whenever I choose the blank Steve template and color the head then back out, no colors are shown on the head of the blank Steve template on My Skins. Please look into this.",
            "The ability to copy your own stored skins to make variations is not provided or obvious how to find in the android version. While the app is an excellent choice for editing the skin itself the lack of this basic function brings it from a five star app to a three star app.",
            "I don't know what happened to the nice gui this app used to have but now it's just a bunch of terrible hamburger-style menus and the skin download function no longer works, so I can't import my old skins to edit, making the app basically useless.",
            "This app is amazing and easy to use! I reccomend it to anyone who wants to make Minecraft skins! I just have one problem, when i look up a skin, it doesn't load anything! It didn't use to do this... Please fix it developers!"

            "it's really good, but it has a downside!! So I really like it, but it has a lot of fake Minecraft Five Nights At Freddy's skins! and there is NO LOLBIT!!! I'm really sad about that because she is my favorite character. And you don't have correct Puppet, and you don't have Baby or Funtime Freddy! You can't forget Bonbon too! This is my personal major problem, but ppl may not know the YouTuber Minecraft Five Nights At Freddy's ! Also check them out they are really good! but please fix this!! :3",
            "With only limited skins and some locked, I cant give a high rating. I found some skins I couldn't find with other apps, so that's good. Over all 2 out of 5 stars. Please expand and categorize the skins and it will improve alot.",
            "It's amazing😍! U all are just picky and mean!!!!!!!!!!😡😬 except cosmic shadow fox she/he cool",
            "Ads for skins ? Not a fan of ads if u love ads then go watch a 30 sec. Ads for a spin .this is an ad machine if your willing to download read this review first before you install this.",

My sister and I have fun trying out new skins. And the derpies are really cute and funny. Five stars= 1- Not much food skins 2- Lots of skins 2- No ads but there is one pop up every skin I download",
            "Love the skins! Although, I would like a duck skin. I figured out that there was exactly 500 Skins!!!!!!!!! And all of them are derp skins! All you have to do is click on the skin, press the download button, then go on Minecraft and clock on owned skins and import and clock on the skin, so easy! I love the app 10/10 you should get it.",
            "This app is amazing! But the only reason 4 stars is because its not an ocean of skins its just 500 skins but its still amazing. Why I got this app is because I enjoy playing Roblox but in derp/troll skins, keep up the good work!",

And in old app we could reject the trade by swiping it right, but in new update we must open the trade, scroll all the way down and click delete, even if that trade doesn't interests us or unprofitable. Additionally, I think you should fix one thing Blocked users supertrades are still visible and can send supertrades to us even if we block them, could you please fix this also. Thanks"

Only a few of the anime characters from the pictures are in the app, the only anime skins are only about 4 or 5 Naruto characters, and the rest are just cartoon characters that 5 year old My Little Pony fans would choose. I don't recommend this app to people looking for quality anime skins, just move on to a different minecraft skin app.",

            "Most of the damn skins are cartoons there was so little anime skins in there there i think you should add more Anime skins like bleach, Black clover and Jojo",
            "yes it was great and good..i rlly found my fav anime which is naruto and boruto..but when there was new skin i thought it was gonna be a new anime skin but its not its still a cartoon which is very boring..pls add more anime skins..so i can rate this 10/10 but i choose 9/10 😊"

Another thing is its not just anime even though it's call ANIME skins it has Steven Universe, Teen Titans Go, Up and a few more I think. I don't recommend just make a custom skin lol they have a few good ones like zero two and sailor Moon. Still dislike it.",

My Wi-Fi is running really well and it still doesn't work. I've done this multiple times on multiple devices. Even my aunt tried on her tablet and it did the same thing. I wouldn't reccomend it, but you can try.",

            "U guys made a great app for skin and sound.I really appreciate it. 1)It'll be more better if you add truck interior sound(engine sound in closed cabin of a truck) because the exterior sound is too intense and kind of unrealistic. 2)Second thing is, you should add realistic truck skin cause trucks generally can't be seen with a lots of stickers and pictures on them.most of the time they are in one colour but the colour is phenomenal (like ETS 2). SO I really waiting for these additions eagerly.",

None of the settings for this skin work for me. 1) Turning on / off vintage screen frame does nothing 2) Changing background textures does nothing 3) Changing accent color does nothing How do I get my money back?",
            "Dials and sliders have a nice, polished, hi-fi look, but I really dislike the cassette style playback buttons, I prefer the round, metallic buttons like in the retro metallic skin. Asked the dev if they would add something, has yet to respond in almost 2 months. I want a refund.",
            "A lot, and I mean a lot of work has clearly gone into this skin. Yes, when Poweramp changes most skins will require work, so don't be angry if you have to wait a bit longer for this skin to be updated accordingly. My only gripe but it's a big one is that if you want to use Poweramp full screen (ie status bar hidden) you have a hideous white bar where the status bar was. Perfect skin though.",
            "thank you for fixing this. really appreciate, without it i could nolonger us poweramp with its ugly new ui, this is simple, looks great though not exactly dark solid black as it used to appear. Could look alittle more darker/solid black as it used to on the older version but still alot better than the standard ui. appreciate!",
            "As a long time user of Poweramp, I am very hard to please when it comes to third party skins. A great audio player demands equally great skins and many just don't cut it. This is a tasteful, high quality skin that looks fantastic! Definitely worth the price of admission and my personal favorite!"
