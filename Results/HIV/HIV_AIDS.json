        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS.

            "My brother got diagnosed with Aids just a couple of months ago, and everything about the virus was new to us, especially the terminologies. As I was researching about the illness, I came across this app. The reviews were terrific, but I had to see if it will work for me. Two months down the line I am impressed!! I can be able to guide my brother though acceptance period and boost his self esteem thanks to this app. This app has all the information I needed concerning the illness, and I was conversant with the terms. The app is not slick regarding the design and technique, but it does a fantastic job as it is required. I strongly encourage anyone who is suffering from Aids to have this app. It had all the information I needed; hence I did not need to google anything. It has proper punctuation, and it is effortless to use. The best part is it is available in two different languages, English and Spanish.",

Their support team actually CARES about you and does their best to solve problems. They are firm, but FAIR. 💗 try this app! Update: still good! I like it! 😁👌",
            "I've been on the site and app for a few years. Lots of inactive profiles, they spark you with people from a whole different side of the country, you have to pay to see who liked you, or made you a favorite of theirs. I've paid for a membership a few times, because I wanted to talk to someone, just to find out their not inactive, or lived 800 miles away. $30 a month also too expensive to talk to 1 person a month. Added a good thing with gold tokens, and took it away for some reason.",
            "The quality of women on your app is the best by far. Whatever algorithm you are using is useful. Keep doing what you are doing. My only complaint but not really that is there should be read receipts. Thanks.",

            "Why do I keep seeing people from across the country? Also, I live in a city, why can't I limit my search to less than 100mi? Just easier to tell new people what my issue is on Facebook Dating than to use this app with horrible filters. Definitely canceling my subscription. Too bad I can't give less than 1 star..."

As soon as I installed this app, 3 seconds later, it prompted me that The app is infected And uninstall is advised. I have tried it out because i have installed lot of vpn apps from google play which i heard that are infected And thought if it is worth upgrading from premium trial to real premium. After this, i Will surely upgrade to premium. Thank you for creating this test file. It's not real vir. Kk."

            "After updating my Galaxy S3 to Jelly Bean, my navigation could no longer lock a signal. I was stuck with \"waiting for location\" and \"searching for gps\" messages. I tried resetting data and clearing caches with no luck. I was ready to do a full factory reset when I tried this app as a last ditch effort and it worked perfectly. Immediately after using it, my nav worked. I can now lock gps signals instantly and consistently. Thanks for creating such a great app and making it free.",
            "After flashing new roms, GPS stopped working.  Tried many different apps to fix the issue but nothing works.  Thought it doesn't hurt to tried one more.  Went out, start the app, pressed a few buttons...GPS LOCKED LOCATION!",
            "I can't believe this worked!  Samsung Galaxy S2. My cells gps would just say 'searching for location'  it was like it could never find me!  Well its working 100% now!!  Thank you so much:-)",
            "After installing a new rom I had the typical issue \"gps not working\". I spent so much time trying to fix my GPS,  countless hours in tech forums, downloaded a ton of apps with no avail...finally wen I was just a tad from giving up, I came across this unique app 1 minute later... IT IS FIXED!  Unlike many paid and non paid apps who promise to fix the issue,  this app really does work..Thank you so much for saving my Galaxy Note!",
            "This product was once good, but now is full of unwanted extras that have nothing to do with enhancing the gps. On the top of that, the free version is now severely restricted in relation to gps enhacing capabilities."

            "Ausome App. ¹ People talk about too many adds #no i ldea what they are talking about, havent had a single add since i got it. Gives me most of the songs i type. The only thing i would tell you is you need to type in variations of the samesong to gat it but besides that live the app totally recommend it. Dont listen to the 1 star ratings, i think they are doing something wrong.",
            "Loved it. It was working so well and i could find and download every song i searched for but about a month ago, the main search engine, #2, just stopped working/loading. Unfortunately, engine #1 has a very limited search pool and engine #3 is totally useless. I don't know if this is the result of a glitch or an update problem, but I'm about ready to unstall this app if this problem is not fixed.",
            "This is by far the best app I've ever used. Just make sure u download, Samsung music, & this app will easily download to Samsung music app. Out of 900 songs I've downloaded, I can't find 3 songs, which is okay. You do have to do some digging for some songs, for example if u cant find Bye Bye by Mariah Carey you have use Mariah Carey bye bye or bye bye Mariah Carey. Usually u can find by artist but if u look by song, some songs are remixs or knockoffs but this is the best app I love it! ❤",
            "When i first download it, everything was fine and i almost rate it a 5 star UNTIL, when i try to download a song it will say the song file is corrupted. not just 1 time but when I want to download any other song it will say the same thing.I already checked my phone storage and I still have 2GB left.Did this app need more storage then that.PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!(and the amount of song i already download is 105)",
            "So far I'm loving this app. I've been able to find all of the songs I've searched for. Sometimes, I find a version of a song, thats a little different than the original, but is even better. I love that. Thank you for making this!!"

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training.

            "It's alright. I switched to Deezer to try it out and although I'm not hating it, I'm not loving it either. The most annoying thing so far that I've came across is the queue list. I do not understand why when I add a song to queue, it adds it to the bottom of an already preloaded list? It's really annoying. If I'm adding songs to queue, I want to listen to those songs after the current one finishes not random 20 songs that Deezer has decided to put in there before my ones. Edit: I do have Premium",
            "The music reccomendation and mixes are absolutely awful. The \"Flow\" mix keeps repeating the same songs instead of letting me explore music. But the worst part is the network issues - there were so many times the songs just wouldn't load (while other apps work just fine so its not my network thats the issue). In my opinion Deezer is just a low-quality Spotify imitation.",
            "Rated 2 because I use the download functionality to be able to have local copies of songs due to poor mobile reception around where I live. However, even though songs are downloaded, deezer won't load the downloaded playlist with poor mobile reception, so the functionality is useless to me. Means everytime I open the app and go to play songs I can't until I get reception again. Spotify, and apple music both work correctly, so switching back. Edit in response to reply: not device related",
            "Good selection, but hard to navigate to music you can \"download\", which you actually can not download to your device at all, even as a premium subscriber. If I pay for premium service, I should be able to download music to my device (I wouldn't have a problem with the download self deleting every so often), so I can play through my own music player. I can not play through my Kenwood Weblink, or my Pioneer Weblink, for display purposes, or to overlay my Navigation System. If so would rate 5 star",
            "This is my 4th review, after this I am not gonna pay for this app. As I am writing this my eyes are about to close and Deezer has still been able to load my playlist (as usual) and when it does most of my songs are skipping like a broken disc, the development team isn't seem to be doing any fixes. I used to love this app but it's getting too annoying now. This app is too unresponsive and I use a s10 and it's also the same thing on my dad's s20."

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"consumption\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. \r\nTuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke.

            "Very poor communication so far. I asked them if they needed any more information from me in order to get my birth control, and they have yet to even respond to me. Giving it a 2 star rating for now, but it could easily drop seeing as I just started using the app. Honestly, it might just be best to schedule an appointment with your doctor. 🤷‍♀️ Edit: yes definitely a 1 star. Just go to a doctor please. It's just a huge scam",
            "I am overly grateful for this app. I've been using them for a little over a year and im happy I dont have to see a Dr in person for birth control. They are a rad bit slower to responding to messages since covid occurred but not by much. I've gotten all of my questions answered since I only started pills last year for the first time. Love it! ♡",
            "Convenient, affordable, accessible. Takes them days-weeks to respond to messages. Another week or so to to put the order through, no option for expedited shipping. But then your card gets declined (bank issues, low income, etc.) they lock the prescription until you change cards/message them to re-up the RX. Birth control is something you have to take regularly and it's ridiculous for them to make it so hard and time consuming EVERY time I try to order. Planned Parenthood is still best.",
            "I used to love this app for bc. I needed an emergency contraceptive and decided to get it through this app. It said $20. I checked out and my total was $35 because of the \"consultation fee\" which is dumb cause it's just plan b but hey I'll pay $35 instead of $50 if I got it directly from the store. I picked it up for it to be the regular $50 plus a stupid $15 consultation fee! Ridiculous! Very misleading.",
            "I used them for a couple of years. I have had to change my password three times over the course of three months. Could not get access to my own account due to an error saying that i did not have permission to access this account (after i already changed my password so i knew that was not the issue). I tried reaching out several times and was told to change my password and nobody has reached out to help me since. I have since changed who i get my birth control from."

Thank you guys!! the new features are also great!!! *I don't know yet how affordable is this app, i fear i won't be able to purchase it after they reintroduce the paying plans. But i am really thankful for this free period, i feel it helps and i really needed a good tool to help me regain balance at this strange, unpredictable time. Thank you! Great and beautiful app! 🙏",
            "I initially installed it because of the aesthetic appeal. Recently I have been using the planne function regularly and it is really great to have the three subsections for work, play and test. It helps me make sure that these needs are balanced. I try to fill the three clouds when I remember, but I'm not yet regular with it. The Thought Diary function was immensely helpful in a difficult situation. Even my therapist was really impressed by this app. Thank you so much!",
            "The app is great. If you pay for the non free parts it would be a better experience. I'm currently using the free section but helps as have to think and find the positive in the day and why do I think its happend. It helps to re read when going through a rough day and realising that you have more good days if you find the good.",
            "I like it so far. Would be usefull to have it on other languages. Really like the rabbit on app icon, It may sound crazy 😄 but every day I remind my self to speak with rabbit, share my thoughts with him and try to stay positive. It is so easy to forget how much I have done before and go down by judging and critisizing myself for being lazy. Day planner helps to realize that this is just negative thinking. Meditations are ok.",
            "It has a cute visual design and is very simple to use, only I do wish there were some more features other than writing down notes. Maybe some guided meditations...idk, something with voicework. EDIT 8/15/2020: A few months in and I'm starting to face a bug. While using the daily planner app, which I often do, copies of my tasks will come out of nowhere and more will eventually be added automatically when I tried to delete them. Also, I did make the subscription purchase but for some reason I rec"

The basic nature of our mind is to dwell in the past or to worry about the future. Our lives have so become busy and stressful preoccupied with distractions that we let go our mind to enjoy the present. This results in helplessness, fear, negativity, depression and unhappiness. And the antidote to our unhappiness isn’t the newest thing, the latest diet fad, or the next achievement. The antidote is Gratitude. \r\n\r\nHere's how you can benefit from Gratitude Journaling. Keeping a Gratitude Journal and practicing Gratitude\r\n1. Increases your happiness\r\n2. Improves your Mental Health\r\n3. Helps you savor Positive Experiences\r\n4. Helps you to cope with major life challenges.\r\n5. Fosters Resilience.\r\n6. Boosts your Self esteem.\r\n7. Fosters Empathy.\r\n8. Gives you a better night's sleep.\r\n9. Strengthens Relationships.\r\n\r\nBeing grateful & thankful for all of the blessings you have makes you feel good about yourself. You realize that there are so many reasons to be grateful, and your self-esteem is elevated. When you feel good about yourself & happy with who you are, you will find that this attitude also raises how you view your own life & the world around you. As such, gratitude creates positive emotions, like joy, love, and contentment, which research shows can undo the grip of negative emotions, like anxiety.\r\n\r\nThere are several incredible books like The Secret, The Magic by Rhonda Byrne, The Power of your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, Gratitude Diaries and Simple Abundance that have explained how Gratitude works wonders in bringing the change in our lives. There are several personal coaches, mindfulness coaches, yoga trainers & mentors that have found Gratitude journaling to be the best start towards self development and self love. It’s not always easy to effectively deal with tough situations like abusive relationships, financial crunch, grief, trauma, depression and attracting the wrong people and circumstances in our life. And at these times especially, it’s tough to bring a self change and change the circumstances. Keeping a Gratitude Journal and Practicing Positive Affirmations could be great start and baby steps towards shifting your negative energies to positive.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the app or getting start with your Gratitude Journaling Journey, please don't hesitate to write to me at sankherpritesh@gmail.com\r\n\r\nYou can find the Privacy Policy for the app here: https://gratefulness.me/privacypolicy.html\r\nPlease find Terms & Conditions here: http://bit.ly/3077uoX",

The basic nature of our mind is to dwell in the past or to worry about the future. Our lives have so become busy and stressful preoccupied with distractions that we let go our mind to enjoy the present. This results in helplessness, fear, negativity, depression and unhappiness. And the antidote to our unhappiness isn’t the newest thing, the latest diet fad, or the next achievement. The antidote is Gratitude. <br><br>Here&#39;s how you can benefit from Gratitude Journaling. Keeping a Gratitude Journal and practicing Gratitude<br>1. Increases your happiness<br>2. Improves your Mental Health<br>3. Helps you savor Positive Experiences<br>4. Helps you to cope with major life challenges.<br>5. Fosters Resilience.<br>6. Boosts your Self esteem.<br>7. Fosters Empathy.<br>8. Gives you a better night&#39;s sleep.<br>9. Strengthens Relationships.<br><br>Being grateful &amp; thankful for all of the blessings you have makes you feel good about yourself. You realize that there are so many reasons to be grateful, and your self-esteem is elevated. When you feel good about yourself &amp; happy with who you are, you will find that this attitude also raises how you view your own life &amp; the world around you. As such, gratitude creates positive emotions, like joy, love, and contentment, which research shows can undo the grip of negative emotions, like anxiety.<br><br>There are several incredible books like The Secret, The Magic by Rhonda Byrne, The Power of your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, Gratitude Diaries and Simple Abundance that have explained how Gratitude works wonders in bringing the change in our lives. There are several personal coaches, mindfulness coaches, yoga trainers &amp; mentors that have found Gratitude journaling to be the best start towards self development and self love. It’s not always easy to effectively deal with tough situations like abusive relationships, financial crunch, grief, trauma, depression and attracting the wrong people and circumstances in our life. And at these times especially, it’s tough to bring a self change and change the circumstances. Keeping a Gratitude Journal and Practicing Positive Affirmations could be great start and baby steps towards shifting your negative energies to positive.<br><br>If you have any questions about the app or getting start with your Gratitude Journaling Journey, please don&#39;t hesitate to write to me at sankherpritesh@gmail.com<br><br>You can find the Privacy Policy for the app here: https://gratefulness.me/privacypolicy.html<br>Please find Terms &amp; Conditions here: http://bit.ly/3077uoX",

Maybe I'm missing something.... this app has taught me how to be happy again. I began with 2 entries a day and now when I'm bored I get on just to journal. it's great therapy!",
            "This is a really slick and effective app. Simple, like all the best things, and good at stimulating the habit of daily gratitude. I especially like the daily zen quotes - I come back for these and it helps me remember to write something positive too. Great job!!",

            "Glad I purchased the Premium. Couple of feedbacks and preferences I've noticed since using this for a few weeks now. I wish there was a better way to construct different and multiple playlists. I have multiple playlists for very diff topics. Sometimes I wish I could play all of them while I sleep. Sometimes I wish I can play some. But it's designed to only play 1 playlist, and you can't modify it without changing the name of the affirmation altogether.",
            "I love the concept for the app, however, there are a handful of small usability issues that become really annoying the more you use the app. 1) No filter or search on affirmation record screen 2) No way to select multiple hashtag playlist for playback 3) No integrated way to stream own music while listening to affirmations. Dropping music vol in thinkup and opening other app causes affirmations to not be loud enough. Still like it a lot, though.",
            "*Edit: THIS APP DOESN'T WORK ON MORE THAN ONE DEVICE. There is no \"restore purchase\" option on my second phone when I download the app, because it DOES recognize that I've already got the premium plan. However, none of my recordings are there. I would have to re-record everything to use this on my other phone.This is a fatal flaw. Can you please fix this so the app can be used on multiple devices?",
            "I like that I can record my affirmations in my own voice. There are a lot of affirmations to choose from and I can edit them to make them personal to me. It would help if there were suggestions given on what background music to use to reach your desired goal. You can also change the level of your voice to the background on the paid version but no guidance is given. Also, the Android version is much cheaper than the one for my iPhone which I thought was weird.",
            "Unfortunately, the Android version isn't fully updated with all the features that the Apple version has. I hope you will update it asap. I bought the Premium version on Android and was dissapointed to see features missing: there is no option to control the speed of the loop of affirmations and there is no Stats tab with statistics about your progress. Such a shame!"

I had a sort of mental break down, and became extremely depressed. This was a little tool that helped me pull myself out of the pessimistic and bleak thinking processes, but honestly, I believe prayers were the MOST helpful to me!",

After it bounces to the top, I would pull it back down and by the time I would find my place I didn't have time to finish a sentence before it would bounce again. Very disappointing.",

Nor has facility to print out what the best way possible to achieve the goal of the english language is important part in understanding the value of the word and how much you can do better than words learn to live with equanimity or the person who teaches the truth lies with the family of the people of this kind of work out something about it. Thanks to the best of everyone support United.",

I just spent 20 min trying to read chapter 2 I gave up half way because I had time to read a sentence or two before I had to find my place all over again.. helpful material!! I just wish I could actually read it😭😭"

            "Honestly, I haven't even gone through reading all the texts in the information section, and I can say that I already like the app! 😊 The explanations and the amount of information that is given are excellent and I think that this app could be really beneficial for anyone struggling with these problems. In the least, it could help with putting one's thoughts into perspective, which is a great aid in itself.",
            "Good resource, but it needs to also include positive moods and their effects so people don't fixate on the negative or develop the sense that things are always bad. I was peaceful sitting outside in the sunshine but had no way to log this and remind myself how to achieve peace or conjure positive memories.",
            "this app is very useful in controlling and helping negative thoughts by guiding you into logical reasoning. soon, you'll learn how to stop your own spiraling thoughts. probably saved my life a half a dozen times. :)"

There's so much more you guys can do. I hope you read this review. I'd be willing to pay a few dollars if this app included more.

It is challenging to think about what you are grateful for in negative situations but honestly doing that has really helped open my eyes to how maybe things arnt as bleak as I initially thought!",
            "Research has proven that practicing gratitude changes your mind set for good. 365 Gratitude gives you a jumpstart by suggesting things to think about in your practice toward grateful mindfulness. It's a great app, especially for the gratitude newbie! - Michelle",
            "Awesome app! I never seen any like it because it is positive and everyone knows how to inspire and has courage to say things that's just pure gratitude, never seen anywhere before like I said! It is great!"

It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.\r\n\r\nUnder the Global Vaccine Action Plan, measles and rubella are targeted for elimination in five WHO Regions by 2020. WHO is the lead technical agency responsible for coordination of immunization and surveillance activities supporting all countries to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nMeasles is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10–12 days after infection, include high fever, a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.\r\n\r\nSevere measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.\r\n\r\nRoutine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with low routine coverage, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths.",

            "I had to change to 1 star. I paid for the app. Redownload on my samsung A20. Changed a thousand notifications settings and its still won't send me my positive quotes. :( Before: This app changed my life.... I've been on a journey of self discovery and self love and the messages at different intervals are so perfect to remind me of my goals. I often find myself sharing these with friends. I switched phones and I had to redownload. Love this app ❤",
            "I love the app, definitely worth the money I paid for it. One thing I would love to see in the future is the ability to add a few of my own affirmations in the mix along with the ones that you have chosen. Like, give me a blank (no text, just the pics/etc) template for each category and let me type in the words I would like to see in that category. That would be an amazing addition!",
            "Love this app, recommended it. Just true texts, better than some affirmations because I totally agree with these truths. But please help me fixing it. Since I bought it, it doesn't work properly. Reinstalled it, restarted and resetted it too. Still doesn't work.",
            "I absolutly love this app! It has helped me in more ways then I ever thought an app could! I highly recommend this app to anyone that needs encouragement or motivational words in there life. The fact that you can personalize it to have you name in the message you recieve makes this app even better bc its actually like your own personal message from your life encouraging you every step of the way. Thank you so much for help me im my journey of my recovery and bettering my life!. Nikki Morris💜💛",
            "Love the app, and the reminders throughout the day. A couple things I'd change are giving us a gender neutral option for the language in the romantic sections. And there are some typos scattered throughout. Other than that I love it."

            "The UI is beautiful, however most of the affirmations are unusable. They are just written the wrong way, in the negative form, with words like \"struggle\", \"worry\", \"difficulties\". Words carry energy, and the right way to write positive affirmations is in the positive form with positive words, not in negating the negative. Example. Instead of \"I won't worry\" effective positive affirmations should use \"I will relax\". I down voted so many of the negative affirmations but they're just too many.",
            "It's a good app. I just wish the other themes worked. I try to view the free add for a new theme, but it never works. Other than that, it's chill app.",
            "The themes are a scam. Why only 1 default? Then you have to watch an ad every single time you want to switch? Ridiculous",
            "I really can't describe it. When I came to the app store looking for a daily affirmation app, I was skeptical, I was in such a dark place, but I got this app anyway feeling desperate to find something to help me. I had to force myself to repeat each affirmation through out the day at first because I was so depressed and self hating. Now, the notification pops up, I read it and I already believe, I am loving myself more and more daily and I honestly can't believe I got that out of a simple app💜",
            "This app is cute & helpful but riddled with ads and that defeats the whole purpose of the app. Who needs all those interruptions when you're trying to enter a zen-like mode? You might as well pay for the dag-on app if you truly want what you came here for. I'll see how I feel about it in a few days. I feel disappointed & played."

The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "Although the daily messages are beautiful, the app lacks depth and quality in the other meditations. Apart from BK Shiwani and few others, all the meditations are very poor and distracting. Especially meditations guided by make members. I paid for the full year subscription (that is actually very cheap, which is good part), but I really wish the quality of other guided meditation would have been better. For better meditation, I will now shift to other applications",
            "Best apps for tracking your daily meditation and emotional being. No hesitation to recommend its paid version too. Excellent in all forms. For the developers: Please provide a reminder option for daily meditation activities so that we don't miss it.",
            "If I am a paid customer and I logout of my account then can it be accessible again ..I guess no cause after I gave feedback in my paid account my apk got exited and it's not even working now ......what can I do now I'm frustrated I used it only 7 days I'm frustrated pls do solve my issue",
            "The content and the way the app is designed is excellent. But I am facing problem in the app. It keeps on hanging and pausing and I cannot access any of the meditation videos. My internet speed is quite decent to open and play videos from other apps. Kindly request your help and support to resolve this issue",
            "Very nice and motivation experience during all the meditations. I will give infinite stars to apps. Please not, in some guided meditations audio, music listening more loud than the voice, please try to keep balance between music and voice. It will be nice to hear soothing music with meditation audio. By the way, I am continuing to give infinite stars."

            "This app really let's down the experience of otherwise excellent hearing aids. As mentioned by others, with the Bluetooth connection to your phone activated, any interaction with the phone(taking a call,'liking a post on Facebook,plugging in the charger etc etc), causes a default to Autosense option,which kills the settings on your aids,or the custom settings you may have defined for yourself.(This is even after switching off ALL notifications from phone) This is a major fault,and needs fixing.",
            "Slowish to connect but a useful app once it has. Easy to use. Like others Ive found the app quite frequently disconnects which does limit it use. The disconnections are more frequent and are limiting the use of the app. I've installed the updated app and it makes no difference to the disconnections.",
            "Volume doesn't stays consistent when when using the app. Have the hearing aids turned down when a message comes in the volume changes to a painful level. Tried using some of the preset programs, can't edit or save. My Resound app worked much better.",
            "At least once a week, I have to uninstall/reinstall the app because one or the other of the HAs won't connect. It's an irritant because the app controls the sound and pitch. Since I have rechargeable HAs, the app is the ONLY way to control that aspect. I give the HAs a 5star but would rate the app a 3. When it works it's very, very good. But when it doesn't it's horrid.",
            "Close to useless. It keeps disconnecting the Bluetooth and resetting back to Automatic. More trouble than it is worth sadly. Moto Android 1"

            "It's a very good up to learn skills for parenting situations. I enjoy the short chapters, interactive summaries at the end, the videos are lovely quality and they talk to you in a way you still learn but not to getting overwhelmed with too much scientific jargons. It is also enjoyable as a wind down after a hard day with your toddler ☺️ or to find answers for a situation you had on the day, how could I do better. Thanks for them to give this tool to us for free, it is deeply appreciated!",
            "I am so impressed with this app. I have learned such a tremendous amount in my lessons and look at things totally different. I am excited to do more and plan on sending this to all my friends and family so we can all evolve together. Also, I'm hard of hearing, not only does the caption actually work (a lot don't) on the videos, you can read the transcripts of the videos,I love that!",
            "This app is so well designed and the information in it is presented in very thoughtful and easy to digest segments with a small recap quiz after each short video to solidify your learning. I am so grateful that I am able to access this for free! The quality of the apps design; the expertly curated information; and the production value of the videos make the experience feel like I am enrolled in a really expensive course. Thank you so much!!!",
            "I dont usually bother to review apps but this is amazing & after only the first set of videos how I see my kids & their needs had changed. The videos are bitesized & packed with information from professionals & have a short recap questionnaire after each one to make sure you haven't missed anything. I was honestly waiting to be asked for payment for further access. It doesn't happen, it's completely free. 👍from me 100% totally worth checking, you have nothing to lose & everything to gain.",
            "I recently started using this app because I wanted to do some sort of parent training. It has been one of the most educational apps I've seen for parenting, they use lots of nuero scientific information to help you understand your child, how their brain functions, how you can create deeper bonds with your children. I think every parent could benefit from the quick short lessons they have and you only need a few minutes a day to make your relationship with your kids more strong. Highly recommend"

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

The ability to change the order of the affirmations and visualizations. Thanks!",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

A second reason for giving a 3 rating is that some quotes are repeated 2 or more times on a list. Currently, I'm still viewing quotes, however I may stop because a lot of the Millionaire Sayings do not meet my values.",

I am very thankful to developer and teams of this app who made this beautiful app. Whenever I used to loose my hope and develop negative things on my mind. I just used to open this app and feel energetic. I don't have word to say thanks. But also very very very thankyou from the bottom of my heart.👏👏👏",
            "The app is great there are lots of great quotes. It would be nice to read more than five at a time before being trapped in a window demanding I rate it!!! So here's your friggin rating, sorry I couldn't give you a half star. Perhaps now I can be left alone to enjoy the app!!!",
            "Takes a really long time to load the quotes when you open the app, The graphics that come with the quote are quite distracting. It also doesn't give you the option to not like a quote. I might keep the app if it weren't for the terribly show load time.",
            "The quotes are varied and they certainly open one's eyes to the knowledge that you are not the dirst to feel what you feel, you won't be the last, and you will persevere. Inspiration and lessons that has stood the test of time. Love this app!"

        "description": "COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",

Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

I believe this is a serious design flaw, since the app is advertised as being in English, and actually isn't once you are out of English speaking countries. Don't the developers think that non-native speakers already have difficulties finding first aid info without being locked out of English translation? Disappointed.",

            "Decent information, but not nearly enough, which is fine considering that is a secondary function. This app is perfect in theory, though a significant amount of the population would have to download it, and keep bluetooth on, to see benefits. People need to embrace this for any real benefits. Also, to everybody giving bad reviews because of bluetooth, go read why bluetooth is the method used before trying to ruin an app. If they chose the alternative, you would probably be up in arms.",
            "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
            "Not sure how good it is yet. But I know it sucks the life out if my better. As the Bluetooth searches for a device and is unable too, my Samsung S9+ last week before installing the app would get close to 20 hours on a charge, now after installing this app, I get about 8 hours on a charge and the phone is down to 18%.",
            "Very happy with this app. My friend told me he doesn't have the newest version of his iOS & can't download it. Seems like we will miss a lot of people this way. Also, would be helpful to have a link to the new cluster map integrated. Everything else is wonderful. Easy to use, visually elegant, multiple languages available. I like the health log as well. ETA: After reading other reviews, I have to say it's affecting my battery life at all, & alerts are anonymous and delayed. Explains in the app!",
            "It's quite a relief having this app. It lets you go about with a little more confidence that no one is near you with Covid. Even for my husband's sake, who's a cab driver upstate and takes full precautions, I don't have to spray Lysol all over him when he walks in the house. There is no invasion of privacy; if someone is near you with Covid you get an alert with a code number. No names at all. Thank you Gov. Cuomo."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

Too many clicks, not enough pictures or examples, to the point of not being practical. The Canadian Red Cross First aid app is SO MUCH better.",

            "I often hear the sound skip, like it suddenly stops and starts, repeatedly every night at random intervals. I've also woken up in the night to realize it stopped working altogether. I've tried restarting the app, closing all apps and reopening it, and restarting my phone, but it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and I don't think I can justify the purchase until it's fixed.",
            "To put it bluntly: this app rocks! Honestly! I've tried multiple apps such as this, but none of them had a feature where you could add music to ambient noises, not music of the type this app has. Due to personal reasons, I suffer from relentless insomnia, but this was literally my \"Ultimate Sleep solution\"! Every megabyte sacrificed for this app was worth it!",
            "I love this app. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have recently started having problems wit the app. It stops about 2 hours after I start it. I have purchased the premium package when I first got it, and it played all night. Now it doesn't. I love hearing music all night, it helps me sleep, so when it stops I wake up.",
            "Love this app and it's been a huge aid to sleep. I used to toss and turn for an hour or more, but now I almost always fall asleep well before the 45min timer turns off my favoured sound. There's a great variety of sounds too, lots more than other apps I've tried and much more realistic. I only use a few, and the one that works best for me is Gentle Rain so I tend to stick with that one. I paid for the full selection and was happy to (its just a small one-off fee) to get the variable timer.",
            "ABSOLUTLY 5+ STARS This is by far the best app I have ever used. The sounds are very authentic. You can download many sounds at the same time and save to your favorites. I enjoy so much, that I purchased the premium.Good deal.You won't regret it. I'm sleeping the best I ever have. Thanks to the Ultimate Sleep App. I have tried many others and none of them even come close.💯❤"

One thing I do think should be changed: \"tylenol/acetaminophen\" is listed separately from \"pain relievers,\" and since it comes later alphabetically, a human checking the list of toxic substances could stop at \"pain relievers\" and never see the information they need.",

It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!"

            "Love my local store and pharmacy but your app needs a lot of work. I've tried several times to add my pharmacy in the app but each time I get a time out error message after entering my information. Another major headache: when I select an item in an email, the app opens, initially shows the item, then jumps back to the app home page. Worse, the item I selected is not on the home page. These two things happen every time, without exception, even after the recent update. Please fix this.",
            "Tried to sign up for an account, and it doesn't recognize my email addresses as valid. Since they receive email, maybe you should actually follow the RFCs about valid domain names, instead of some custom BS. My primary email domain name has a dash in it, which is valid. The alternative has 3 parts to the domain name. Both were rejected as not valid. Since they are both valid for everyone else, the problem is with your app or services.",
            "This app has been glitching out like crazy. I open the link from a text notification and it freezes so bad that I can't even close the app. Now it's saying my email access is denied due to an error and that my password changed, when it didn't. Aside from being completely unable to use the app since the glitching out, it's been a nice feature to use.",
            "No longer loads. I finally get in and in tells me I need to login again but logging out produces a HTTP error. I uninstall and reinstall and the error on login is \"HTTP 403 Forbidden\" from within the app's login screen. It is hopeless. Almost an hour later and I was able to actually log in, but even with 2 refills displayed I couldn't reorder the prescription so was forced to call the pharmacy directly - which went smoothly.",
            "Works great, when it works. The communication between the app and my local pharmacy is iffy at best, and often give conflicting information. I usually have to call the pharmacy anyway to accurate information of refill requests or medication that has to be ordered, or shortages"

            "I love this app, but there is so many ads!!! I am using the app less now because of it and I'm now using another app instead, which I admit isn't as good, when i try to read picture quotes a 5 second ad will pop up after every one, haven't experienced any bugs or crashes or app shut down, just an overload of ads, annoying!! I will give it some time, if ads are still an issue, I will probably delete, I wouldn't mind paying for premium, with no ads, but currently not an option.",
            "I love this app. I dont usualky rate apos, but have found this one worthy of a rate. The ads are not to annoying, but the quotes are really amazing, inspiring and very relevant at times 😂 I love how you can listen to various types of hypnosis' and meditations, whether guided or musical, that cover a varitety if topics. Would definately recommend this app!!",
            "I really enjoy these. The updates have helped with the crashing. I wish those with music would keep repeating like they did briefly but an update stopped that. They have been very helpful to overcome abusive brain washing and help me to better use the law of attraction to change my life. I love it. Thank you!",
            "I use this app pretty much every day. It has a variety of wonderful tools to help me heal and grow. There are options to suit everyone & new content added regularly. All you need to get the most from this app is an open mind and a willingness to change for the better. I am grateful to the developers. I would love to have the option to upgrade to an add free version. The adds really detract from all the wonderful aspects of the app.",
            "Since the update, it crashes during the hypnosis, which makes you have to start over. The ADS omg!! Now I cant even choose the hypnosis I want to listen to because of your ads in the way of very important hypnosis. Very disappointed"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

Can't fix the streak counter if it somehow misses a day, which is one of the glitches. Also, the narrator doesn't know what landscape means, he keeps saying landscape when he means portrait. App is decidedly meh and doesn't offer anything unique or special. Wouldn't purchase, only free trial.

Its simplicity allows anyone using them to get answers to daily issues on life.  \r\n\r\nBecause the definitions for each card are uncomplicated and easy to read, these oracle cards make it accessible for the user to tap into the wisdom of their own intuition.  The Five Vibrational Dimensions of the Soul  is a very special spread where you can do your own reading, taking you through the five levels of your soul assisting you to get answers to Universal Truths that you need to acknowledge. \r\n\r\nThese cards reflect the pervasive changes in our lives helping users with guidance to get past blocks. The messages give them insights on what might be holding them back.  The definitions are ‘grounded’ so will help guide the user towards the direction they need to go at that moment.

Brightest Blessings & Blessed Be Dear Ones 🙏🌛🌝🌜💜",
            "It's good. Although I wish the back of card full readings fit on the screen without the need to scroll... and that there was a resource that gives overall instructions for an Oracle card beginner like me.",
            "Totally Legit. I'm a professional Claircognizant psychic. I've used this app before for personal use and have tested it over and over. It's accurate AF. You can't try to trick the deck or if it tells you something you don't want to hear, that's not the deck's fault. Don't blame the cards for your own energy. The cards are a mirror. They show you where u are & what can happen if you keep going the same route. You are in control of your destiny! Great app! Unlocked! Would definitely recommend!",

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

The only restoration is to wipe my phone, use Pixel backup, still lose a week's of conversations, and then manually backup my SMS content each day.

You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

So it is not any good to watch TV as all you will hear is echos and delayed voices which means when watching their mouths and scenes does no match what you see. Be ok to leave your device next to others to hear better but delayed Shame, would be a good app if they get rid of the DELAY .I won't be using it but if that gets fixed be good.",

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

Moreover, the app should continuously prompt, when bluetooth is switched off. This way, people around will be safe. Also, the app should start giving a siren alert or vibrate, if you come near someone with \"unsafe\" stat on the app.",
            "Totally useless app. If it has real time data on positive patients and their location, with my Bluetooth always on I expect that it warns me when I am in the vicinity. It does not. Moreover, now that I have 2 next door, it has no clue, it does not show them. It caused undue stress on me telling me I am at risk, two days after I may have crossed someone in a busy intersection. It is simply, ineffective, useless. I am not removing it only because some places want to check it.",
            "It doesn't work properly, even after testing Covid 19 negative, app is still showing Red and says I am still infected. All the people around me our troubled because of that. Inspite of writing emails with attached reports and screen shots, no action was taken. My status has not changed. I am left with no option but to delete the application until it is corrected. It is disappointing when you visit places where Aarogya Setu application is mandatory. Needs lot of improvement.",

The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure. Most types of porphyria are inherited from a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.",

There is SO much info - any test you can think of - with the background, indications, ranges, descriptions, and even collection instructions (tubes, etc)! Underlying pathologies, clinical S/S of abnormal results, and other info is included. I'm super impressed :)",

On the down side, the app doesn't tell you the industry standard normal ranges. Also a drawback are the colors used in making this app. It is very difficult to read. It should be black, white, grays, etc. ... like a book.",

            "Amazing app. Full of features to help with negative thoughts, track your mood and set goals. Plus loads of info to help you learn more about CBT and yourself. I'd rate much higher than 5 stars if I could. When mental health services let me down I would credit this app with literally saving my life.",
            "Sensible and practical CBT, helps you feel better about your efforts, and gives insight.",
            "I recently came across this and I find it enjoyable and helpful. I'm not sure how I feel about the points yet, but it seems like a cool idea. I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "I love this app and the science and research behind it. It is simple to follow; the voices are pleasant to listen to; the app/experience is setup very well; and it flows beautifully from the lesson to the practice. This app will be useful/helpful to you. This is my go-to app when I need to center myself and deal with stuff at work or at home. I've recommended this app to my family. Thank you Richie, Cort, and the rest of the team behind this AWESOME app!!!!",
            "the app itself is great, but it crashes constantly. I can't even make it through the first exercise. I don't want to delete it because it's the only app like this that I found, but it doesn't work period can you help me with this so I don't have to delete it? if it ends up working, I will give it a higher rating, the only reason why I've given it a low rating is because it doesn't work.",
            "This app did have some bugs and glitches before, but it seems to be working well now. I stuck with it even with the glitches because I really like the meditations. Here are some of the best features that make this one of my favorite meditation apps: - ALL content is free, with no ads! - Research-based, includes interviews with experts in academia - Choice of sitting or active mode. Active mode is great for when you are driving or doing chores - See your progress over time with their quiz",
            "Hi, I really enjoy using HM and the guided practices are very useful. For the last few days I've been facing an issue with logging in. I tried to figure if this is at my end or is it the app. Please help resolve",
            "I love this app, it guides you through various meditation practices and teaches you slowly but surely the positive effects meditation has on the brain. The app actually has courses designed by the Dr. Richardson and his amazing team from Madison Wisconsin. Its free but would encourage people to give if they can."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

Sign up for our free loyalty program to get an extra $5 off your next refill.\r\n\r\nPrescription drug prices are rising. Lifesaving medications could cost thousands of dollars. If you can’t afford your meds (or simply don’t want to pay that much money for a prescription), use the SingleCare app to find coupons for prescription drugs and save up to 80%. Whether it’s insulin for diabetes or an asthma inhaler, you can find a free coupon for it here.\r\n\r\nWhat is SingleCare?\r\nYou use coupons on groceries, clothes, and home goods—why not prescriptions? Couponing applies at the pharmacy counter too, and SingleCare makes it easy. Our accurate drug pricing tool helps you find low prices on thousands of FDA approved medications.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nWhen a doctor prescribes a medication, search for your prescription on our website or app. Then, compare prescription drug discounts at pharmacies near you. After you find the local pharmacy with the best price, show the Rx discount card to the pharmacist before you pay for your prescription. You’ll receive an instant discount on the cash price of the drug.\r\n\r\nWho can use it?\r\nAll customers at participating pharmacies in the U.S. can use our prescription drug coupons. It doesn’t matter if you’re a doctor, nurse, patient, pharmacist—if you take medication, we have coupons for you.\r\n\r\nHow much does it cost?\r\nSingleCare is 100% free. Whether you’re insured, underinsured, or uninsured, you qualify for a reduced rate on prescriptions with SingleCare. Unlike manufacturer rebates and patient assistance programs, there aren’t any strict eligibility requirements or limited-time offers.\r\n\r\nHow can I save on my medicine?\r\nTo get the best deal on every refill, ask your pharmacist to compare your cost with insurance or Medicare (called a copay) to your discount with SingleCare. Did you know that prescriptions are cheaper without insurance 25% of the time? Stop overpaying for your prescriptions by using our free Rx coupons at a local drugstore.\r\n\r\nWhere to use our pharmacy discount cards:\r\nWe partner directly with thousands of major pharmacies nationwide, including:\r\n- CVS\r\n- CVS Pharmacy at Target\r\n- Walmart\r\n- Walgreens\r\n- Kroger\r\n- Albertsons\r\n- Rite Aid\r\n- Longs Drugs\r\n- Sav-On Pharmacy\r\n- Fry’s\r\n- Harris Teeter\r\n- Wegmans\r\n- Meijer\r\n- H-E-B\r\n- Hy-Vee\r\n\r\nEnter your zip code on the app to find a participating pharmacy near you.\r\n\r\nMore ways to save:\r\n1. Ask for a prescription. To use our coupons, a medical care professional must prescribe the medication. You can still save money on vitamins, natural health supplements, and over-the-counter medicine as long as you have a script for it!\r\n2. Go generic. Generic meds are cheaper than brand names. Ask your healthcare provider if a generic version of your prescription is available.\r\n3. Buy in bulk. Fewer refills = fewer copays. Fill a 90-day supply instead of a 30-day supply to save more in the long run.\r\n4. Shop around. Enter the drug name and dosage on our app, and enter your zip code to compare costs at local pharmacies. If you don’t see your exact med on the app, you can still take our prescription drug discount card to the pharmacy and they can look up if there is a SingleCare offer available.\r\n5. Use SingleCare Rx coupons. You can text, email, or save your prescription coupon or simply show the app to your pharmacist at checkout to save up to 80%.\r\n6. Reuse coupons on every refill. Use the Drug Basket feature to save your prescription coupons for quick savings on future refills.

            "Hello I enjoy the app and feel it is one of the best out here. However, I would love to see the simple features of being able to: 1. Set the back ground image to an image of my own choosing like you can on Android phone's home screen or lock screen.  2. Allow you to like someone's text in a group chat.  3.  Allow you to add an remove ppl from group chats without having to create a new group.  Thanks",
            "Years after my last review, I still use this app daily. This really is the best messaging app out there. Still doesn't support sending videos, for some weird reason, but it's a solid app, backs up messages directly to the Android message store, allows you to customize the background, foreground, text bubbles, even the app icon. If you're one of those people whose default messenger doesn't let you send you send full-sized images, Textra is the only one I've found that lets me do this.",
            "Textra is the ONLY messenging app I will ever use! It's easy to use. You can customize EVERYTHING. Like the colors you use for every contact. You can set up Textra exactly how YOU want it to be. You can change the ring tones for every contact. There are 3 types of emojis you can use. I use IOS even though I have an Android phone. If you have an idea that you think might make Textra better, send them your idea and they may use it. If you need support-it's there. I love, love, love it!",
            "I have been using textra for years, always loved it, but here within the past day or so, chat heads are now popping up for new message notifications while I'm currently in the middle of messaging someone else. When you click to open the chat head it doesn't allow you to do anything, so you have to drag it to bottom to close it. Please how do I disable this feature, it's unpleasant and unwelcomed.",
            "When switching phones I ended up having trouble sending mms messages. When Textra support was contacted they were prompt in answering and emailed back and forth with me to try and fix the problem. Ultimately it was the cell providers/SIM card that was causing the issue. I have used the app for many years and on several different phones. I will continue to use this app and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for the help and a great app. Special thanx to Mandy and Max👍👍"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "It keeps saying an app is needed to use this device. Its installed but that same message appears even after uninstalling, and reinstalling. So I have hearing aids that have massive static, and what sounds like loud wind overpowering everything and anything people are say. My hearing loss is severe, 20% hearing in my right and 36% in my left. This helped a bit for a little while. Then I saw they were disconnected. Now it say app needed to use device but I have the app. What a mess, and stress",
            "Android support for hearing aids is poor, I have Galaxy s20 ultra and an iPhone XS plus. On the iPhone the Evoke app works perfectly as well as Com-Dex if I use the streamer. On the Galaxy Evoke pairing is a pain, drops connection, Com-Dex never connects. Widex needs to fix yes, but Android is a poor platform for those with Accessibility needs, if you really want to enjoy them get an iPhone. Calls stream perfectly and you'll enjoy your aids.",
            "I didn't see a big value in the app until I lost one of my hearing aids. Twenty four hours later, after buying a metal detector and using it all over the house and yard where I'd been working I thought about the app and wondered if it could help me find the aid. Sure enough! Great feature.",
            "This APP was already very poor and now after Sep. Android update is garbage as it no longer works at all !! I really regret having chosen widex for my hearing aid.",
            "The hearing is good but I was not informed that they only play music if you have an Apple I Phone 8 or newer! I have an android Samsung S9+ I had just purchased. I feel like I was mislead and wish I had known more about hearing aids before my accident!!!! These should be able to play music with the phone I have because it has a 2g extra setting to cover those problems. But WIDEX in their infinite wisdom hasn't bothered to fix this discriminatory practice. Overall if I had to do it again, I'd go to a more honest dealer. Just be careful, because the app became unuseable immediately after I posted this!"

            "The app used to be useful. I used the map to see which tower I was connected to. I was pointing antennas and found that made the job easier. Now, the map shows me where I am (believe it or not, I already knew where I was) but it just says 'Disabled (beta, early preview.)' I can't find anything in settings that says how to turn it back on, but the app is no longer of any use to me at all. If you know where you are and signal strength (your phone tells you that), having the app is pointless.",
            "Nice premise. Very interesting. I've discovered more about what it does over time. It's a little hard to be sure I understand what I'm seeing and can do. Biggest annoyance? Using the log viewer. I can't understand how the list is sorted and I don't know how to resort it. When I reached 1000 records months ago, no newer data shows up. No clear way reset it. No way to know what data is really being collected and uploaded. No way I'm going to purchase top option just to see how it works",
            "It's better now than before the update. The thing that still Aggravates me is I have the paid version and if I want to access my logs on the cloud that cost extra after the first 20 days. It doesn't say how much extra or how long you will have access until you must \"donate\" again. That's the only thing I see it is asking for extra money after you buy the premium. Maybe I misunderstood when I bought the app or maybe I just didn't see where you must donate to keep all the access you start out with",
            "This app used to work beautifully. Now, I'm getting no number such as 24, 25, etc. & Instead...It reads EARFCN UNKNOWN persistently. Very distressing, as it looks like all phones are connected to a ROGUE BASE STATION or a Mask that suppresses G Mail function...and tell us more does not function either. I'm out! Sorry...",
            "No longer functions as it once did. No more band identification which is the main reason I got it. Other apps reliably identify the band. What is most distressing is that I pay for the subscription to the upgraded surface but my 2 emails to them have gone unanswered. Cancelling my subscription."

Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably pale. Problems with growth and development may occur in children.

Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding.

            "It's a pretty basic app, with some good recipe's, I would really like to see more of a description of what some of the detoxifying drinks do, example \"detoxifys your liver* not just like \"here drink this detoxifying drink*",

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

So sadly, after many years of use, I'm going to have to uninstall and find an alternative.",

It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

            "# 1): I have only used this application one time, just a moment ago, and I already like it! The only reason that I'm only giving this app three stars, for now, is for the simple reason that I don't know how well this application helps in long-term care. I believe it's got the potential to be very useful, but until I'm certain, I'm not rating four stars or more. If I find that this app is more useful than I expected, then I'll automatically rate it 4 stars, and possibly 5 stars, later on!",
            "It tends to forget what day it is, so when I put in my sleep it is for the day before, but im trying to do today. And when I change the date it erases the previous day. Its very frustrating. I would like to have another mood meter saying something like mad and cool something like that. My warning signs are being angry, not so much being happy and sad. I had a good day and I put I was happy, and it said it was a warning sign but it wasn't and I put down a sad, and it didn't mark a warning sign.",
            "It's a nice app the only bad thing about it is that you have to pay to look back on your previous months if you want to see if you are improving plus there is no option to send this data to your doctor via email I wish I could effort the pay version but I'm on disability and i have barely enough to survive on",
            "I've only been using this for a week but it's really helping me keep track of moods and taking my medicine. However I do think theres room for improvement I think they should add more moods and allow you to note warning signs even if the server doesn't ask you to, I added an elevated mood and it didn't prompt me to enter warning signs and I can't find a way to manually mark them. Sometimes you have to adjust your sleep times. Otherwise great app!",
            "App will try to force you to use location tracking, which seems absolutely unnecessary to me. Also, when I enter +2 anxiety, -2 energy and -1 self-confidence, it'll still say 'I feel okay', which is obviously not the case. I wish you could enter that yourself as well as the UI doesn't do a proper job with that."

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

Now I have OKIQCIB but snap assist spelt PHOBIC with these letters. Kindly fix this",

            "My experience with the app was life- changing. I'm so grateful I came across the app, not a coincidence at all especially because as a qualified Transformation/Life Coach I'm so much into self empowerment/ development. I found a whole lot of information resonating with my beliefs, vision, goals and values. Thank you so much for the inspiration! However, I have a concern about grammar errors in different chapters. Please look into that for future purposes.",
            "I like the app I like it shows knowledge but one thing it always takes me to the menu every time I try to read it .it needs to be fixed so we can read it and understand",
            "it was getting helpful to an eye opener. i even liked it so much that i added the other books/apps in the Smart Goal Trainings series to my wishlist to remind myself to check them out when I get the chance. i plan to download and read each one,one at a time until i finish at least all of the ones that peak my intrest and I add to my wish list.",
            "Hopefully the developer of this app will use our reviews to improve this app and hopefully it will happen soon. I will just echo the way that it is written, and I would hope before someone puts an app out there they would proofread and make sure that the app makes sense. I certainly appreciate having the ability to have all these free apps but regardless of whether it's free or you pay for it it needs to be written and it needs to make sense professionally. But it's an awesome app.",
            "I give this app three stars for the reminder to think positively and the reasons why, however in turn, the first eight chapters basically say the same thing just reworded. Also because the grammar is so bad that I found myself rereading sentences to correctly understand them. Not to mention the split words like (p eople) shows this was just thrown together for ad revenue more than anything else. Thank you for the refresher course though."

            "I understand needing location for the alerts but why would it need bluetooth? Modern day dependence on wireless devices destroys battery life as it is. I keep my Bluetooth, location and few other settings off unless I need to use them. Again, I understand location, but why bluetooth. *Anyone that doesn't know keep bluetooth wifi and nfc off unless you need it to keep yourself safe from hackers.",
            "During setup I realized that it requires both GPS and Bluetooth to be engaged. If I do this with my phone, it would die in 4 hours. I'm an emergency service personnel, I can't go with a dead phone all day. Sorry. Good idea but won't work for me.",
            "Cannot even finish setup poor development. Simple alert app should not be inconvenient to use if it is most people won't go through the headache of setting it up. This fix should be top priority. Poor development something like this should be more easily usable.",
            "Graphs of the data are basically useless without the ability to filter on the last 30 days. The data from March-April dominates the plotted ranges which makes it difficult to determine the actual covid cases and deaths that are occurring now.",
            "I had no problems installing on Galaxy Note 20. I think the app is a great idea. I just wish the general public would embrace it instead of fearing it. Some view it as a threat to privacy and simply don't understand how it actually works. A bigger PR campaign is needed I think."

            "Hello, my phone has been spammed. I thought this app is supposed to protect against that. Now I don't know how to stop the spamming. I keep getting messages that my phone will be locked if I don't install and pay for Spam protection.",
            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",

            "I got this app before all the upgrades. I believed in it, bought the lifetime subscription, and I am satisfied. there's so much content, great readings, and I love the explanations that come with the transits. I will say, if you're getting into astrology, this app might be a but overwhelming but they lay out things very clearly. so with your own research/ questions you can understand. overall, I would say they did a good job with updates and I can't wait to see this app even more.",
            "Never paid much attention to these apps until I used this. So much information, and for the last couple of months I'm blown away by daily, it's like someone is following me and advising, sometimes warning on situation that I find myself in out of the blue. The more I have paid attention, the better I feel with everything in this world. I'm not the type of bloke that does this..but I am and it's working wonders",
            "Intuitive interface, great info, good charts, but capitalism (no way to avoid it and not the fault is app) has made the free version is sparatic in letting one access the results is readings or the definition of patterns. Also, I hope any updates include astroids: their meanings in the chart, their influences; The Grand Trine: definition and quines: definition, affects and any other info.",
            "Latest Update killed it! I have literally used this app for at least FOUR years if not more and always loved it. Even reccommended it however it updated 10/16/20 and has since crashed anytime I try to use it. Its logged me out and forgotten my login information. I created a new account only to have the app continue to crash. I enjoyed using this app until the update. Forced update forced me to uninstall after using for over 4 years :(",
            "A very interesting app that is allowing me to learn as I go. My only complaint is that I cannot find West Chester, Ohio as a town when I search in location, and I had to substitute the nearest town, which has completely altered the chart. If there is any way to add this location I would greatly appreciate it."

            "As an original Kickstart backer in 2017, I have always been pleased with my purchase, until this last update. I can't begin to tell you how upsetting it is to go to your digital fence option to pull up history that's always been there until now. All the sudden, without warning, my history is limited and I'm supposed to pay a premium to access my data that was already there? Shameful..don't let greed get to your head. You'll lose customers. Sure hope this gets enough attention from the community.",
            "They introduced a premium subscription plan. This was not part of the deal. Deal was buy the fing box and you get all the software and features that come with it. Now they are finding ways to nickel and dime us and to keep us as paying customers. Every company does this. Offer an idea, back them up, you pay for the device and then the company now has millions of people with their device in their house. Then comes the hidden repeat business plan. Hate companies like this.",
            "This app used to be clean and simple, but now it gets more and more cluttered with each update. I used to use it exclusively, but now its so cluttered with \"features\" that it is almost impossible to find the features you need. It's so sad when a good app gets ruined like this, more features does not make an app better!!! It can if it's carefully designed but fing has totally failed in that regard. I have decided to move on and I am now using a different app that's more like Fing used to be.",
            "I've been using the fing app for a long time now and I really love it. I liked it so much that I bought a fingbox when they were still looking for funding on indiegogo. After updating the app today, I am disgusted to see that the developers have the audacity to offer \"premium\" features for a subscription. This action leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as this is how the developers treat the very people who enabled them to bring the fingbox to the market.",
            "Since Google doesn't provide enough characters for a thorough review of Fing, I'll just WARN anyone considering this app to look elsewhere. If history is any indication of what can be expected, then you need to know that paying a monthly subscription fee won't be any assurance that you'll get what you're paying for very long. And if competent Tech Support is important to you, then you definitely need to look elsewhere, because if you have a legitimate issue they can't fix, you will be ignored!"

            "I like this app. A lot of good tracks and albums can be downloaded into the app and listened to offline. That's if you are subscribed to Amazon prime which is only $7 a month. I like that in the app there is an eq for different genres + a custom setting where I can adjust the bands on the EQ for best enjoyment of the music . Easy to navigate and user friendly app. For a lot of tracks, the lyrics are shown if you want.",
            "Try to stream a song, says it can't find on SD card?! Why would it be on the SD card if streaming online (5g connection mind you)? Ok, so I'll download it, wait, nope, won't make any progress. Just updated a few days ago, fixed nothing yet had the nerve to ask me to sign up for the monthly service?! Seriously, let me play the music I own properly and I might consider that in the future. In the mean time, get this sorted out please.",
            "What music? I can hardly play anything that I have in my music anymore, out of several thousand songs. The only thing that doesn't get auto-skipped are songs that I've got offline or the occasional song that HASN'T been made unavailable for some unknown reason. This has been an issue for months now, with no solution. As with other users, I have also had issues with the app crashing, upon attempted login or while listening to songs. Might as well use YouTube Music at this point.",
            "So unimpressed with this app, constant glitches, crashing. Try and use it to listen to a podcast while I walk the dog and it can't even manage a few sentences before it has crashed and I have to get my phone back out to touch it to start playing again. I have a very new modern phone if it doesn't work on this how would be it on an old phone with less power.",
            "Update: got update and still no \"play next\" option so i took away a star. The U.I. is garbage. A \"play next\" option after shuffling is a must. I hate having to go back and searching artists to find a song just to have that option. Also, being able to arrange songs more than a few spots at a time is a must. I've had songs cut out for several seconds at a time. Very annoying."

The data is validated from sources (JAMA Rational Clinical Exam Series, etc).<br><br>When examining a patient with a presumptive diagnosis, such as stroke, physicians can now see in real-time how specific findings on the history, physical exam and laboratory evaluation of patients alters the likelihood of disease. <br><br><br>&quot;Diagnose is a fantastic app that encourages the application of evidence-based medicine in clinical practice.&quot;<br>- Daniel Schwartz, MD<br><br><br>The following evidence-based summaries are included in this app:<br>Acute Cholecystitis<br>Acute Otitis Media, Child<br>Alcohol Problems<br>Ascites<br>Bacteremia<br>Cancer, Family History<br>Cardiac Arrhythmia, Any<br>Cardiac Arrhythmia, Significant<br>Central Venous Pressure<br>CHF<br>Cirrhosis<br>Compliance and Medication Adherence<br>COPD<br>COPD (Multivariate)<br>Death after Cardiac Arrest<br>Deep Vein Thrombosis<br>Delirium<br>Dyspepsia<br>Ectopic Pregnancy<br>Headache, Need for Neuroimaging<br>Hemorrhagic Stroke<br>Hypovolemia, Adult<br>Hypovolemia, Child<br>Influenza, &gt;60 years old<br>Influenza, any age<br>Irritable Bowel Syndrome<br>Knee Injury, ACL<br>Knee Injury, Meninscal Tear<br>Meningitis, Adult<br>Myocardial Infarction<br>Osteomyelitis, Diabetic<br>Paracentesis<br>Peripheral Arterial Disease<br>Pleural Effusion<br>Pneuomnia, Adult, Community-Acquired<br>Pneumonia, Infant and Child<br>Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated<br>Renal Artery Stenosis<br>Septic Arthritis<br>Sinusitis<br>Splenomegaly<br>Streptococcal Pharyngitis<br>Temporal Arteritis<br>Thoracic Aortic Dissection<br>Upper GI Bleed, Locating<br>Upper GI Bleed, Severity<br>Urinary Incontinence, Women<br>Urinary Tract Infection, Women",

Thank you so much for making this possible. Please do keep updating the database, even if a pay functionality is warranted.",
            "This app organizes raw sign and symptom data to develop a differential diagnosis list. In reverse, it shows the weighting values. It is limited by a small diagnosis list and common diagnoses for which most physicians would not need assistance. It is well written but will see its true proof of concept as more diagnoses are added, bringing decision weight confabulation (in the programming sense) to the algorithm. Well done first effort! Peer reviewed crowd-sourcing might accelerate development."

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

I have been using this app for quite some years and found it reliable in its daily prediction, also, the design is not bad. Thank you the developer(s).",
            "This app is spot on and offered much that leads closer to inner peace and true love. I did. I always have . I always will. What it means to always be with you, distance is temporary, true love lives forever!!!",
            "Once again, here we are again. Glitches y'all have them something terrible. I am no longer able to even open the app. It states that I need to check my internet connection and then try again. Well, all other apps and internet based interactions are working on my phone. I've tried with just wifi and just with mobile data, I still get the same response. I have power cycled my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It's still not working. 🤔🤔🤔",
            "This is usually very good,but today it keeps telling me to check my internet connection,when I try to open this app. All other apps open, except this one....... so after this review I see\"minor alterations& updated January 8th 2020...but the app has the same forecast day after day....this is my favorite horoscope apps 💔....so here it is Feb 20,2020 & the app is stuck again,keeps saying\"check internet connection\" My internet connection is fine, the app is NOT...😳 please fix soon🤞",
            "Best horoscope app ever. Never have I had one be so on the dot and accurate EVERY single day. It's is almost scary it's so on point. Good job, I always recommend to my friends and family... Just one question, how come my friend who has an iPhone 10, is not be able to down load the app. It says, \"it is not avaliable in his country\" ? But he use to have it and he lives in the same country as me."

To all those who shall pray my Rosary devoutly, I promise my special protection and great graces.\r\n2. Those who shall persevere in the recitation of my Rosary will receive signal graces.\r\n3. The Rosary will be a very powerful armor against Hell; it will destroy vice, deliver from sin, and dispel heresy.\r\n4. The Rosary will make virtue and good works flourish, and will obtain for souls the most abundant divine mercies. It will draw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.\r\n5. Those who trust themselves to me through the Rosary will not perish.\r\n6. Whoever recites my Rosary devoutly, reflecting on the mysteries, shall never be overwhelmed by misfortune. He will not experience the anger of God nor will he perish by an unprovided death. The sinner will be converted; the just will persevere in grace and merit eternal life.\r\n7. Those truly devoted to my Rosary shall not die without the sacraments of the Church.\r\n8. Those who are faithful to recite my Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces and will share in the merits of the blessed.\r\n9. I will deliver promptly from Purgatory souls devoted to my Rosary.\r\n10. True children of my Rosary will enjoy great glory in Heaven.\r\n11. What you shall ask through my Rosary you shall obtain.\r\n12. To those who propagate my Rosary I promise aid in all their necessities.\r\n13. I have obtained from my Son that all the members of the Rosary Confraternity shall have as their intercessors, in life and in death, the entire celestial court.\r\n14. Those who recite my Rosary faithfully are my beloved children, the brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ.\r\n15. Devotion to my Rosary is a special sign of predestination.",

            "Pretty decent app especially compared to similar ones out there. Expected delivery to take forever but was impressed it only took roughly a week (at least in the UK). Every single item is packed neatly and individually, quality so far was amazing, clothing so soft and the size right on point! Love all the discounts! There is room for improvement, such as the filters which don't always work (when choosing to see only a certain size, age etc), but overall I'm impressed and will keep on buying!",
            "The filters don't always work well which can be frustrating. The sizing of the clothes are not consistent. You also don't always get what is pictured. For e.g. I thought I was getting a set but it was only a top. I bought several items and satisfied with about half of what I received. Still on the fence about ordering again even with a voucher they sent me.",
            "I love shopping with PatPat! I'm Australian, so I was surprised how quick shipping is. The quality of clothing is great and the range of bright coloured clothing for boys is brilliant! It's so great to see an affordable clothing company doing bright clothing for boys rather than the boring blues, greys and browns you usually have to choose from at most shops. They have awesome sales too. I've been receiving lots of comments from strangers about my son's cool clothing.",
            "I like the clothes but the quality of some dresses is good and some not that good. And patpat made some levels if you reach that level you will receive some gift voucher every month but unfortunately they are not doing it, they have provided 1 month after that we need to chase them for the rewards. Instead of understanding customer querry they just want to debate with customers, I feel it's unprofessional and they need to improve customer service."

I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

We update the game every week so don&#39;t forget to download the latest version to get all the sweet new features and levels!<br><br>New to the game? Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",
        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

        "description": "The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  \r\n\r\nThe use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age. Users will be asked to confirm that they are 18 years or older the first time the App is opened.\r\n\r\nHow the COVID Alert PA App works\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train, at a check-out line in a grocery store, or at a restaurant or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.\r\n\r\nIf an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded, a public health representative will ask the individual if they are willing to accept a 6-digit validation code. If they agree, a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. \r\n\r\nUsers who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.\r\n\r\nIn the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.",

            "Easy to install and use. Also includes a symptom tracker and gives weekly notifications reminding you that exposure notifications are active or when you turn off Bluetooth. I would like to see a feature where you can see how many \"contacts\" you've had. How many random IDs has the device collected? This would tell me how many people around me are using the app & how likely it is that the app would sense a \"contact\" with an infected person.",
            "Bug: Cannot update/add symptoms after selecting \"no symptoms\" for the day. I like to check in in the mornings, but one day I checked in with \"no symptoms\" and later in the day felt unwell; I wanted to report my symptoms but apparently could not since I had already checked in with no symptoms. Seems like a glaring oversight. Otherwise, it's a good looking app with a solid premise.",
            "Despite the description saying that this app uses Bluetooth to determine if you have been near someone with Covid/Covid symptoms, it is telling me I must have location services (GPS) turned on to work (to get Exposure Notifications). Between privacy and battery life concerns, this is a no-go for me. Publisher - please explain why location services (GPS) is required.",
            "The app says that exposure alerts are disabled and that I need to check my devices settings. When going to check the device's settings it tells me that the correct settings are enabled. It also gives me a random notification every once in awhile that just basically tells me that the app is installed. Seems pretty useless. I may be missing something, but I'm fairly sure I'm not.",
            "Also IT technician: pixel 3a phone: this app does absolutely everything correctly. 1% battery after 2 hours so far. No popups, no slowing down my phone. It doesn't use GPS or my contacts list. It doesn't even ask for my name. The app doesn't need any of those to work. It just needs Bluetooth. Please encourage everyone to get this. We are in this together. Let's get out together."

Otherwise a normal person will not buy from your app bcoz its wasting of money on buying suxh expensive cloths.. And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

Even though i typed it in for my debit card. 2 time it has also been over 2 months and now again they can't find my address but yet never reach out I write them all the time. Worst company ever. Shien is waaaaaay better and deliver in 2 weeks. Ver poor customer service"

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "App worked great to connect the D-link range extender. I located the range extender in my garage. Before installing the extender the wifi signal in a room above my garage was 0 to 1 bar causing a camera to disconnect but with the extender the signal is now 2 to 3 bars. I think the wifi camera outside the upstairs room and a myq hub should now stay connected. I'll probably add another extender for my back yard to connect a camera for my dogs.",
            "This app no longer supports any of the wifi extenders sold in the stores. They phased out all the current ones and force you to buy new online. My dap-1530 is no longer supported and its brand new. You need to update this app to support last year's model. Ridiculous!",
            "This apps and router is awful. It super slow and takes many tries to configure it out. I just bought it few weeks ago anf i hated it. Im switching back to old router.",
            "Not as powerful as logging directly to the router via ethernet. And you can't change or set the frequency of the router from the app (setting it temporarily to 2.4ghz for an install)",
            "Absolutely frustrating. I followed the setup instructions 16 times before it finally connected on it's own as I was trying to figure out how to get some help from the website. The app would say the device was booting, the device would start blinking and then shut off, and then the app would not be able to find the device. Over and over again. And the FAQs were incredibly unhelpful. I even tried it using the wps button instead of the app and STILL no connection multiple times."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad.

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

            "Very relaxing and enjoyable. Like the affirmations a lot. Peace and joy always ends before it's finished. . . Updated 7/1/20 Like the affirmations a lot. However, this is my 4th notice that peace and joy always ends before it's finished. . . In fact, all of the affirmations end before they are done!!!!",
            "Great content but it is really inconvenient that you have to keep your screen on and the app on screen while listening. I like to listen to affirmations in the car but I usually have a navigation app going. I can't respond to texts or anything without playback coming to a screeching halt. Why is it in landscape? I prefer portrait. If I could have this playing in the background while I'm doing other things on my phone, I would give it 5 stars and I'd buy all the content bc Louise Hay is amazing",
            "I did email the developer so I'll wait and see if they will fix the issue or refund my money. Looks like this app has had the problem for a few years now where it closes right after you type in the affirmation. I paid to have access to the whole app but the only one that works right is the free one. Is there going to be a fix for this issue? I would like my money back if not.",
            "Didn't work correctly after first use. Only 1 affirmation came up on the screen when she was repeating 3, and no pop up window to type your affirmation in appeared. Shame because it was nice and relaxing listening to Louise.",
            "I purchased the entire set for $20. It crashes every time I finish typing the affirmation and tells me I'm moving on to complete it."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

We hung out at dinner for about an hour the day before she tested and put the positive result in the app and it's been 8 days since then and I have not received a notification of the positive result. My Bluetooth was on and I have had the app properly functioning as well. This is a big problem and the fault is not on me or my friend.",
            "As odd as this may sound but this app is causing my mobile Hotspot app from broadcasting but occasionally it will broadcast but by the time I try and connect it has \"disappeared.\" On my phone (Note 10 plus) it doesn't have any errors and looks normal but none of my electronics sees my wifi. I could not figure it out until I disabled this app and immediately I could see my wifi again. I can repeat this issue every time I enabled this app (Bluetooth). I don't use the Bluetooth wifi Hotspot so idk",
            "Downloaded 4 days ago. My roommate downloaded app at the same time, but from the apple app store. Their app posts regular updates on how often it has checked for exposure, whilst mine still says \"never checked for exposure,\" despite having given app all permissions and keeping BT and location turned on. One of us reported a positive test, and the other was never notified of exposure, despite sharing a car and house. My sister was exposed from being on a family trip with us, yet no notification",
            "Notification of exposure gave 0 information. Also, it notified me 6 DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE???? I had strongly supported this app in the beginning but now I'm concerned why it seemed to \"lag\" on my notification time and also lack information such as distance from the person, time spent near them, etc. LIKE IT SHOWED IN PRESENTATIONS? What a disappointment",
            "Notification gives no information! I was notified of a possible exposure, but the app only told me the day. It did not tell me how long or at what distance as it's website says it will. Given I wore a mask everywhere, I don't feel I really need to quarantine for 14 days based on an app that so few people have even downloaded! Please give more information if you expect me to take your recommendation to quarantine seriously!"

He was one of the first people to write about the Law of Attraction.\r\n\r\nLong before Rhonda Byrne discovered the secret that one's positive thoughts are powerful magnets that attract wealth, health, and happiness, Atkinson already knew it.\r\n\r\nIn this New Thought classic, Atkinson looks at the law of attraction in the thought world. He points out the similarities between the law of gravitation and the mental law of attraction. He explains that thought vibrations are as real as those manifesting as light, heat, magnetism and electricity. The difference is in the vibratory rate which also explains the fact that thought vibrations cannot usually be perceived by our 5 senses.\r\n\r\nHe argues that there are huge gaps in the spectrum of light and sound vibrations, wide enough to include other worlds. It is logical that these activities would be perceived by sense organs attuned to them. Increasingly sophisticated scientific instruments are able to register more and more of these hidden frequencies.\r\n\r\nThere is constant interaction between negative and positive thought vibrations - it is the task of the individual to raise the keynote of their mind to a positive pitch by an act of will. Atkinson discusses the purpose of affirmations as twofold: firstly, to establish new mental attitudes, secondly to raise the mental keynote. He also mentions that there must be a balance between giving out expressions and taking in impressions in a receptive state.\r\n\r\nThe many faculties of the mind are identified and discussed, and the author asserts that the current of will-power flows strongly along spiritual wires but the individual must train in order to optimally tap into this energy source. The \"I\" is the master of the mind and the \"will\" is the instrument of the \"I.\" Affirmations for internalising this insight are provided here.\r\n\r\nAtkinson also shows how to overcome negative emotions like fear, worry, envy, anger and hate. He firmly believes in the operation of universal law in all circumstances and advises the reader to tune in to the harmony of the law.

It's very important for all women and sometimes men to know more about vaginal infections and their solutions. This app contained the list of infections and how to over comes the problems. It contained names of the infections, treatments and home remedies.\r\n\r\nVaginal yeast infection, also known as candidal vulvovaginitis and vaginal thrush, is excessive growth of yeast in the vagina that results in irritation. The most common symptom is vaginal itching, which may be severe. Other symptoms include burning with urination, a thick, white vaginal discharge that typically does not smell bad, pain during sex, and redness around the vagina. Symptoms often worsen just before a woman's period. \r\nVaginal yeast infections are due to excessive growth of Candida. These yeast are normally present in the vagina in small numbers. It is not classified as a sexually transmitted infection; however, it may occur more often in those who are frequently sexually active. Risk factors include taking antibiotics, pregnancy, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. Eating a diet high in simple sugar may also play a role. Tight clothing, type of underwear, and personal hygiene do not appear to be factors. Diagnosis is by testing a sample of vaginal discharge. As symptoms are similar to that of the sexually transmitted infections, chlamydia and gonorrhea, testing may be recommended. \r\nDespite the lack of evidence, wearing cotton underwear and loose fitting clothing is often recommended as a preventive measure. Avoiding douching and scented hygiene products is also recommended. Treatment is with an antifungal medication. This may be either as a cream such as clotrimazole or with oral medications such as fluconazole. Probiotics have not been found to be useful for active infections. \r\nAround 75% of women have at least one vaginal yeast infection at some point in their lives, while nearly half have at least two.
