For example, the Pro feature Meal Planner is only one day's meals, unless you agree to buy another upgrade to the meal planner that costs about three times as much as you paid to unlock the Pro features. Paid to stop ads -app does not show menu to enter code - wasted that money too. More a store front than an app.",

            "In general this app is helpful. I have one objection - too much focus on disease! A passage that could say, \"to keep your kidneys healthy avoid theses foods\" starts out with this ramble - \"If you have bad kidneys\" \"There are many risk factors for kidney disease\" and just goes on and on planting disease, disease, disease. Do you think you could make the focus and suggestions move in the direction of healthy kidneys...?",
            "I am very disappointed with this so called app.This book really doesn't cover anything except kidney stones and that is anecdotal at best! Forget trying to find out about anything else. In an immature manner benefiting no one but a complete moron, the language of this app is degrading. The sections described only briefly the diseases. Barely covered (if at all) are various ailments of the kidneys. Even if a disease or condition is mentioned, what is said about it is minimal. This app even suggests that kidney disease can be cured which is not the case. Kidney damage is permanent and if severe enough will lead to dialysis or total kidney failure. I think I am giving this app two stars out of the kindness of my heart. I would not recommend this app to anyone except an elementary school student of middle grade.",
            "Too many and too frequent add updates, which makes the page one is reading jump all over the page. Since there is no option to pay for an add-free version, I simply uninstalled this annoying piece of junk.",
            "I have to use this app and practice the natural way to keep my and my familys kidneys healthy. My better half had a kidney transplant, it was eye opening to see how many people are suffering from kidney disease. if you can keep your kidneys healthy now, you are saving yourself/loved one from 30 hours a week in a dialysis clinic. It's unimaginable how many people are in some state of kidney failure. We need to prevent this disease becoming our future. Start here naturally ♡",
            "The author of this app really works hard to update frequently & cover all topics in re kidneys. Sometimes the writer is too simplistic & does not use the best grammar"

        "description": "Kidneys\r\n\r\nConcomitant to their name, kidneys are positioned at the back of the abdominal cavity. Kidneys execute some very vital functions in the human body. These entail formation of urine, balancing chemicals and fluids in the body and extracting waste from the bloodstream. Moreover, they assist various other organs in carrying out routine functions in the body.\r\n\r\nThe pre-eminent functions of the kidneys are as follows\r\n\r\n1. Blood Pressure Regulation\r\nKidneys require a consistent flow of blood to filter it. In case the blood pressure drops, kidneys immediately begin increasing it. This is attained by the production of a vessel-constricting protein known as angiotensin. The kidneys produce this protein to regulate blood pressure and signal the body to retain water and sodium.\r\n\r\n2. Waste Excretion\r\nThe human body accumulates harmful elements such as toxins, urea and excess salts over time. Kidneys facilitate the excretion of these harmful elements by filtering the bloodstream.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain Water Levels\r\nKidneys adjust their function to the level of water intake. If in case the water intake drops, kidneys help retain water in the body instead of flushing it through urine.\r\n\r\n4. Acid Regulation\r\nThe body’s environment can get acidic if the kidneys do not perform their balancing function. Kidneys filter out toxins and metals that can lead to increased acidity.\r\n\r\n5. Red Blood Cell Stimulation\r\nLike every organ kidneys require proper oxygenation to keep up their activity. In case of oxygen, deficiency kidneys release erythropoietin which stimulates the bone marrow and increases the production of red blood cells.\r\n\r\nKidney health is extremely crucial for the human body. Healthy nutrient-dense foods are necessary to maintain proper kidney function.\r\n\r\nDiet has a close relation to kidney health. Deficiency of vital nutrients can be the cause of kidney diseases and kidney failure. People in the advanced stages of kidney disease need to adopt a kidney-friendly diet to prevent kidney failure. Diet requirements vary depending on the stage of kidney disease, however, eating foods low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus can altogether prevent any abnormality in the kidney function.\r\n \r\nIf You like The App Pls Rate it 5 stars!!!",

These two seemly unimportant organs are responsible for a number of processes in the body. Firstly they detoxify the blood, eliminate the waste material through urine and filter out the excess water retained in the body. Moreover, they are responsible for regulating the calcium and phosphate levels as well as for secreting essential hormones which are later responsible for regulating the blood pressure and the creation of red blood cells. They are also vital for transporting oxygen and important nutrients  throughout the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor optimal health, you need to have an excellently functioning pair of kidneys because if their function is disrupted it can lead to kidney malfunction and cause a number of health problems. The most obvious signs that indicate kidney malfunction are; change in color and amount of urine, dizziness, vomiting, anemia, respiratory difficulties, feeling cold most of the time, tiredness or fatigue, itchy skin, bad breath and sudden pain in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Kidney Function is an app that provides the following information on kidney function such as ;\r\n\r\n1.

Bacteria called E. coli are most often the cause. Other bacteria or viruses can also cause kidney infections.\r\n\r\nIt’s rare, but an infection can also get in through your skin, make its way into your blood, and travel to your kidney.

I agree that if I could even scan in a bar code to find the food it would take this app to the next level.",

One upgrade that would set it apart from others would be the ability to scan the upc barcode to log your intakes. By keeping a log it could help a patient customize a solid list of items for a smart shopping and cooking experience.",

Basándose en el Documento de consenso sobre la Enfermedad Renal Crónica (27 Noviembre 2012) y otras fuentes bibliográficas, en la misma consulta con el paciente y en menos de 30 segundos, incorporando únicamente 4 parámetros (edad, sexo, creatinina plasmática y albuminuria), el programa va a ser capaz de indicar el Filtrado Glomerular estimado por las fórmulas CKD-EPI y MDRD-IDMS, el grado de enfermedad renal crónica según la clasificación pronóstica de las guías KDIGO 2012, con el riesgo relativo correspondiente ajustado para cinco eventos (mortalidad global, mortalidad cardiovascular, fracaso renal tratado con diálisis o trasplante, fracaso renal agudo y progresión de la enfermedad renal). Así mismo, el programa indicará si según el documento de consenso antes mencionado el paciente tiene indicación de ser remitido al Especialista en Nefrología, o si debe ser seguido por su médico de AP, aportando además información clínicamente relevante para realizar las decisiones médicas adecuadas “a pie de consulta”. Hace además una serie de recomendaciones acerca del seguimiento que se debe realizar del paciente teniendo en cuenta su estadio de enfermedad renal, y en el apartado de “Otras recomendaciones” se especifica todo aquello que el médico de AP ha de tener en cuenta a la hora de valorar a un paciente con ERC, donde se incluyen recomendaciones acerca de hábitos dietéticos, control de la presión arterial, tratamiento de la diabetes mellitus, control y tratamiento de la dislipemia, hiperuricemia y anemia, recomendaciones acerca de la medicación y también de la frecuencia y seguimiento de estos pacientes. Finalmente, el documento de consenso en el cual se basa la aplicación, está disponible desde la app en formato pdf o ibook, entre otros, para que el usuario lo pueda consultar en cualquier momento que lo desee. \r\n\r\nEsta aplicación ha sido desarrollada por médicos especialistas en Nefrología, que trabajan en el área de la Nefrología clínica y de Soporte a Atención Primaria y va dirigida exclusivamente a médicos, aunque se ha planteado como una aplicación móvil gratuita, sin restricción de usuarios y que no requiere registro por parte del usuario. En ningún momento se requieren datos de carácter personal de pacientes ni del usuario, por lo que no vulnera la Ley de Protección de Datos.

As it is not strictly a single disease, its presentation depends on the specific disease entity: it may present with isolated hematuria and/or proteinuria (blood or protein in the urine); or as a nephrotic syndrome, a nephritic syndrome, acute kidney injury, or chronic kidney disease.

Diagnosing the pattern of GN is important because the outcome and treatment differs in different types. Primary causes are intrinsic to the kidney.

        "description": "Natural Treatment for Kidney Infection | If you’re like most folks, kidneys aren’t much of a concern – until something goes wrong. But these hard-working little organs deserve better! The kidneys are responsible for so many important functions, including filtering toxins from your blood.\r\n\r\nA kidney infection, known as pyelonephritis, is normally affected by a bacterial infection. This type of bacterial infection originates from the urinary tract, and it spreads to the bladder through the urethra and kidneys. Therefore, it can cause negative consequences to one or both kidneys.\r\n\r\nHere’s a remarkable fact: Every 30 minutes, all the blood in your body travels through the kidneys. Every single day – thanks to your kidneys – more than two quarts of waste are cleared from your bloodstream and removed from the body as urine. Without this vital kidney function, waste would accumulate and serious damage to the organs throughout your body would occur.\r\n\r\nInfections and kidney stones are two of the most common kidney problems. Generally, infections are due to the bacteria E. coli gaining access to the urinary tract where they can connect with the kidneys. Technically, kidney infection is a form of urinary tract infection (UTI) and is treated with antibiotics.\r\n\r\nKidney stones, on the other hand, are solid, chemical deposits that form inside the kidney. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of kidney stones. A kidney stone can be nearly invisible to the naked eye, as large as a marble, or even bigger.\r\n\r\nOnly adopt these treatments when you are unable to see your doctor and need to reduce the pain and speed up the progress of recovering. Otherwise, it is highly recommended that you see your doctor as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nDownload this app for several home remedies that you may want to try",

            "Not easy to use. You can't copy items from one meal to another. You can't create your own recipes to make it easier to track meals. It has been crashing when I try to add in my weight so I can't track progress in the program. Overall very disappointed.",
            "Only lets you record macros, need $$pro$$ version to record micros, what a shame. liked the layout and all but charging extra to record micros is greedy. Coding in the extra micros is not difficult nor time consuming, shame on the app developers.",
            "The app itself is great but the database of food is extremely limited. I have to create my custom food all the time especially when 99% the scanner can't find the food even those are common in the local supermarket",
            "This app has wide range of food entrees, which makes it easy to track. I also like the tracking of water, nutrients and log exercise and steps."

Almost 90% of adults with type-2 diabetes and CKD are not currently diagnosed, and as many as 50% of patients with advanced CKD (Stage G4) remain undiagnosed in primary care populations. Several national surveys have shown only 10 to 20% of Americans who have laboratory evidence of CKD are aware that they have the condition. While current clinical practice guidelines for CKD assessment recommend that adults with diabetes and/or hypertension be tested annually for albuminuria, there is underutilization of yearly urinary albumin-creatinine ratio testing in people at risk for CKD. Less than 10% of those with hypertension and less than 40% of those with diabetes are appropriately assessed.",

Also I want to be able to enter my vitals prior to the appointment & not have to say them over the screen during the visit. This is a very basic app needs improving",

Depending on your situation, you may need nothing more than to take pain medication and drink lots of water to pass a kidney stone. In other instances — for example, if stones become lodged in the urinary tract, are associated with a urinary infection or cause complications — surgery may be needed.\r\n\r\nYour doctor may recommend preventive treatment to reduce your risk of recurrent kidney stones if you're at increased risk of developing them again.\r\n\r\nthere are also various ways to cure diseases:\r\n• How To Cure Wheezing\r\n• How To Cure Anxiety\r\n• How To Cure Acne\r\n• How To Cure Asthma\r\n• How To Cure Autism\r\n• How To Cure Allergies\r\n• How To Cure Backpain\r\n• How To Cure Bleeding\r\n• How To Cure Bloating\r\n• How To Cure Cancer\r\n• How To Cure Cough\r\n• How To Cure Constipation\r\n• How To Cure Cold\r\n• How To Cure Chapped Lips\r\n• How To Cure Cramps\r\n• How To Cure Chicken Pox\r\n• How To Cure Depression\r\n• How To Cure Diarrhea\r\n• How To Cure Diabetes\r\n• How To Cure Dizziness\r\n• and others\r\n\r\nThis application is free.

        "description": "This APP provides you with all the food you need to take to take care of your heart and to prevent heart diseases.\r\n\r\nt's the perfect opportunity to be more proactive about taking care of your heart. After all, it works hard - without breaks - to keep you alive, so you should do your part and return the favor.\r\n\r\nWhy else is it important to maintain a healthy heart as you age?\r\n\r\nTaking great care of your heart to avoid cardiovascular disease is critical, but that shouldn't be your only motivator. There are many other reasons to proactively maintain a healthy heart:\r\n\r\n1. To maintain cholesterol and blood pressure\r\nHigh cholesterol levels increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but that's not all. Unhealthy cholesterol in the blood can also lead to heart attack and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure levels are even more threatening to your overall health. Besides a heightened risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure, you're also more likely to develop peripheral artery disease, angina, vision loss and kidney disease or failure.\r\n\r\n2. To reduce feelings of depression\r\nDid you know that cardiovascular disease can increase your chance of feeling depressed? Research shows that 33 percent of heart attack victims end up showing depressive symptoms, according to Barry Jacobs, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and director of Behavioral Sciences at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program.\r\n\r\n\"The big message is that people need to be aware of this connection,\" he told the American Heart Association, where he volunteers. \"The second message is that many treatments are available. No one needs to suffer.\"\r\nResearch shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.Research shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.\r\n\r\n3. To lower your risk of developing dementia\r\nThere's a connection between heart health and mental well-being, but it goes beyond feelings of depression. Research shows that poor heart health is also associated with dementia. When you don't properly take care of your heart - with smart lifestyle decisions - you're narrowing your blood vessels, which then limits the amount of blood that can get to the brain. Without proper blood flow, your brain can't work the way it's supposed to and you may have trouble making decisions, reasoning with others and remembering familiar faces and places.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate memory loss with Alzheimer's disease, and they think it can't be prevented or treated,\" said Ralph Sacco, M.D., chief of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and former president of the American Heart Association. \"But controlling your risk factors for heart disease can make a difference in slowing its progression.\"\r\n\r\nHow can I take better care of my heart?\r\nBy making smarter lifestyle choices, you can protect your heart and reduce your risk for developing life-threatening conditions. Making these small decisions can have a large impact on the health of your heart and your overall well-being:\r\n\r\n    Follow a heart-healthy diet\r\n    By eating more nutritious foods and removing unhealthy fats from your diet, you can fuel a thriving heart, reduce your blood and cholesterol levels and maintain your weight, according to the Heart Foundation. Eat more fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, and limit your salt and alcohol intake.\r\n   \r\nDownload the application and learn about foods that prevent heart diseases and maintain a healthy heart.\r\n\r\nGood luck to all and hope the remedies in this application will help you keep a healthy heart \r\n\r\nConsider sharing  this application to family and friends, it would be a huge support to rate this App five star so that people can easily find it in the store.\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out this App!!",

        "description": "Gout Diet Diet Plan - Low Uric Acid Diet Plan \r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, gout was known as the disease of the wealthy. Nowadays, it is one of the most common metabolism illnesses among adults that is associated with nutrition. Gout results from excessively high uric acid levels in the blood. There are two types of gout, primary gout, which is congenital and secondary gout, which is an acquired disease. Primary gout is the result of a metabolism problem associated with insufficient removal of waste by the kidneys. In the case of the second form, the gout is caused by illnesses such as tumours, anaemia and diabetes with kidney function problems. Nutrition-related causes include total fasting and the increased consumption of meat and alcohol.\r\n\r\nBut what causes excessive uric acid in the blood? \r\nOrganic compounds called Purines are changed into uric acid by the metabolic activity of the body. Uric acid is then eliminated from the body through the kidneys. If this function is disrupted, as in the case of primary gout, the uric acid will remain in the body. This means that the uric acid level in the blood will increase. We also absorb uric acid from our food, particularly from animal products.\r\n\r\nHow does uric acid cause gout?\r\nIncreased uric acid levels usually remain unnoticed for many years due to the lack of symptoms. Ultimately however, permanently increased uric acid levels will result in gout. These increased levels cause the formation of uric acid crystals. These crystals tend to gather in the large toe, in bursae, tendon sheaths, and ear cartilage or in the kidneys as stones. Acute gout attacks typically involve the sudden onset of severe pain, accompanied by extreme redness and swelling in these areas. There is no reason to get to this stage if countermeasures can be taken at the right time, and symptoms can be avoided with a balanced diet.\r\n\r\nHow to diagnose gout? \r\nUric acid levels can be determined through a blood test. Men are much more frequently affected by raised values and gout than women. However, the risk for women also increases at the beginning of the menopause period, as the protective effect of oestrogen will no longer be provided. During a longer fasting period or in the case of extreme diets, the increased breakdown of body cells can increase uric acid levels.

Enter information about your kidney stone (also known as a calculus of kidney or a ureteric stone)\r\n- Enter your stone's size and location, as given by your healthcare provider\r\n- Take a quick assessment to measure your kidney stone pain\r\n\r\n2. Get information to make a more informed decision\r\n\r\n- See what percentage of people tried to pass their stone\r\n- See how many of those were successful in kidney stone passing\r\n- See how your pain compares to others with similar stones\r\n- See how your stone's size compares to all people with a stone\r\n\r\nHopefully, you only have a kidney stone once in your life. But this means that you are forced to make decisions about your care without personal experience. The three most important factors in stone decision making are the size and location of the stone and pain severity. You can’t change the stone’s size or location, but you can understand how kidney stone pain affects decision making.\r\nStone Pass will show how your stone compares to others, what kidney stone treatment decisions they made, and how their stone resolved. Whether your kidney stone passes on its own or requires treatment such as lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy, our goal is that you use this information to communicate more effectively with your care provider and make the best decision for your specific situation. \r\n\r\n**About **\r\n\r\nStone Pass was developed for community education by Dr. Andrew Portis.\r\n\r\nDr. Portis is a board certified urologist specializing in stone disease since 2000. He founded the HealthEast Kidney Stone Institute in St Paul, MN, USA. They created the nation’s first Joint Commission Disease Specific Care Certification in kidney stone disease in 2013.\r\n\r\nWith Stone Pass, Dr Portis shares his experience in caring for over 15,000 patients like you, trying to make decisions about their kidney stones.\r\n\r\n**Source Data **\r\n\r\nOutcomes of over 1,600 patients reported on a monthly basis to the Joint Commission as an element of Disease Specific Certification in Kidney Stone Disease have been stripped of any patient specific identification and is presented in an accessible fashion for this app.\r\n\r\nPatient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Pain Intensity scale 3a v1.0 is integrated within app with permission from HealthMeasures.",

        "description": "Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a disorder of pregnancy characterized by the onset of high blood pressure and often a significant amount of protein in the urine. The condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In severe disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, impaired liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances. Pre-eclampsia increases the risk of poor outcomes for both the mother and the baby. If left untreated, it may result in seizures at which point it is known as eclampsia.\r\nRisk factors for pre-eclampsia include obesity, prior hypertension, older age, and diabetes mellitus. It is also more frequent in a woman's first pregnancy and if she is carrying twins. The underlying mechanism involves abnormal formation of blood vessels in the placenta amongst other factors. Most cases are diagnosed before delivery. Rarely, pre-eclampsia may begin in the period after delivery. While historically both high blood pressure and protein in the urine were required to make the diagnosis, some definitions also include those with hypertension and any associated organ dysfunction. Blood pressure is defined as high when it is greater than 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic at two separate times, more than four hours apart in a woman after twenty weeks of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is routinely screened for during prenatal care.",

An option to back up directly to Dropbox or somewhere would be nice, but simply not losing the data is very welcome. Other than those previous update problems, D-Track is a very good and useful app. I appreciate the developer's attention to dealing with this major issue.",
            "This app is a great concept, but some critical blind spots had me uninstall it and delete it from my app library. I don't have space for a full review, but I'll make a couple of recommendations. 1) Separate the treatment timer from the entering of weight and BP values. There are significant time lapses between taking pre-weight and inserting needles, and also from the end of treatment to taking the post-weight. This is unavoidable. 2) Add fields for blood pump speed, litres processed, Kt/V etc",
            "I've just had this app for an hour and I really like it. It has all the items that I need to fill out each day. Options for: cycler and twin bag exchanges; standing and sitting bp; drop down menu for solution strength for each of the bags; weight; temperature. The only reason I haven't given it a 5* is I've only just got the app. Nov. 7, 2019 The new update erased previous information. I had clicked to reload previously saved amd nothing happened.",

        "description": "The easiest, least expensive way to reduce your risk for cancer is just by eating a healthy diet. When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. \"If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.\r\n\r\nPeople who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it's never going to last. You're looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that's great.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.\r\n\r\nTranslation:\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.\r\n- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.\r\n- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.\r\n- Different vegetables work for different cancers.\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.\r\nSo the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!\r\n\r\nRadishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nYou may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.\r\n\r\nTake this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients.

Highly recommend it for its functionality and value for money in the detail they put into the app. Useful tips and news feeds as well provide helpful information at a glance. First time user and lifetime customer now (or when I can beat this disease). I found using the app helps me be more accountable about my diabetes management. Real data beats anecdotal evidence and the figures don't lie. With the inclusion of a free text field in the Blood Glucose section in the next version update, I'll now be able to input my food intake as well which will bring together everything I need to collect the data that will help me monitor my progress and diet. Keep up the good work Dr Nizar and thank you for providing this app.",
            "Very easy to use App, like how the dashboard is organised. Tiles change colour according to my latest results so it's easy to know what to focus. Meal time targets are easy to understand. Helpful tile on tracking weight. Finally like how it's so easy to share data with PDF.",
            "Amazing app. Can save all diabetes tests in one place, dashboard is amazing with tiles that change color to depending on the latest result! Like the meal specific targets. HbA1c is converted to an average blood glucose so it's easy to relate to it.",

Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.\r\n\r\nPrevention and treatment involve maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical exercise, a normal body weight, and avoiding use of tobacco. Control of blood pressure and maintaining proper foot care are important for people with the disease. Type 1 DM must be managed with insulin injections. Type 2 DM may be treated with medications with or without insulin. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar. Weight loss surgery in those with obesity is sometimes an effective measure in those with type 2 DM. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the birth of the baby.",

You should clearly understand about this.\r\n\r\nThis application will guide you.\r\n\r\nPatients with many different types of cardiovascular disease will be told they need to eat a low-salt/low-sodium diet to improve their health. \r\n\r\nDid you know that on average the higher a person’s sodium intake, the higher the person’s blood pressure? By limiting sodium, everyone can help lower their risk for developing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD). People with normal health need only a small amount of sodium to maintain fluid balance and transmit nerve impulses in our body. But how can you keep track of your sodium when you have kidney disease and high blood pressure? This is a guide to common low-sodium food finds to help you when you’re on the kidney diet.\r\n\r\nMost fruits have either no sodium or very little sodium. It’s recommended to stick to whole fruits that are kidney-friendly, such as apples, berries, peaches and pears. Fresh or frozen vegetables without added salt are good choices for a kidney diet. If you use canned vegetables, look for low- or no-salt versions. Another way to remove extra sodium from canned vegetables is by emptying the contents into a colander, rinsing them under fresh water and then cooking the vegetables in more fresh water.\r\n\r\nMost sodium intake comes from salt added during food processing; this is why convenience foods such as fast food, frozen dinners, packaged side dishes and breakfast and deli meats contribute to high sodium intake. Salt is added to foods for many uses, including curing meat, so that it retains moisture and enhances flavor. Choose fresh meats and fish when you want to cook a low-sodium kidney diet recipe. Check labels on fresh meat and poultry and avoid enhanced products that are injected with a sodium solution.\r\n\r\nDownload this Low Sodium Diet app now for get more info.\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of article",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

        "description": "Osteoporosis is a disease where increased bone weakness increases the risk of a broken bone. It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone. Osteoporosis may be due to lower than normal bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the hip.",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis. Diphtheria is usually spread between people by direct contact or through the air. It may also be spread by contaminated objects. Some people carry the bacteria without having symptoms, but can still spread the disease to others. The three main types of C. diphtheriae cause different severities of disease. The symptoms are due to a toxin produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis can often be made based on the appearance of the throat with confirmation by microbiological culture. Previous infection may not prevent against future infection.",

These include heart health, stroke, kidney health, Meniere's disease, edema, diabetes, weight loss and for good health in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nlow sodium diet\r\nquick low sodium meals\r\nlow sodium foods\r\nheart healthy meals low sodium\r\nlow salt diet\r\nless sodium salt\r\nlow sodium meals\r\nwhere to buy low sodium foods\r\nlow sodium meals\r\nbest low sodium snacks\r\nlow sodium\r\nno sodium foods\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app :\r\n\r\n_ Update once a week\r\n_ Useful tips that we will provide\r\n_ Very simple display in the app\r\n\r\n\r\na little explanation of Low Sodium Diet :\r\n\r\nA low-sodium diet is normally recommended for people with high blood pressure and heart failure. A low-sodium diet essentially means a drastic reduction in a person's salt intake from the daily diet, as salt is mainly composed of sodium. Sodium is an essential mineral that keeps the body fluids balanced in the human body. The normal accepted level of sodium for an individual is 1,500 to 2000 mg per day, and anything in excess of these values could be dangerous and lead to complications of the heart and kidneys.\r\n\r\nFast foods like hamburgers, French fries and processed foods (potato chips and frozen food) are high in sodium. A person adhering to a low sodium diet must avoid these foods. Dietitians also warn against the consumption of cured meats like sausage, ham, and bacon, as high quantities of salt are used for their preservation. One of the unhealthiest medium of high sodium for both children and adults is soft drinks. Soft drinks are not only high in sodium, but have absolutely no nutritional value and cause more damage than any good.\r\n\r\nFoods low in Sodium\r\n\r\nUnprocessed food like fish, vegetables, lean meats, and grains are low in sodium. There are a lot of soup-based foods that are low in sodium content which are available both in stores and online. Some of the other food products that are low in sodium are unsalted butter; herbs like cinnamon, cloves, and oregano; skimmed milk, sugar, honey, and barley prepared in unsalted water. Tea, coffee and club soda also contain low levels of sodium.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that it is not just salt in the natural form that is high in sodium. For example, sodium benzoate is a variety of salt that is produced artificially and used as a preservative to kill fungi, bacteria, and yeast. Sodium benzoate too should be avoided as it contains high levels of sodium. It is very important for people to develop the habit of reading food labels in stores to make the best choices for a balanced diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor people with high blood pressure, it would be wise to consult a dietitian for a sample low-sodium menu on a daily basis. This can help a great deal because a dietitian can create an effective personalized low-sodium meal plan based on the person's requirements. In most cases, people adhering to a reduced sodium diet are able to effectively lower their sodium levels, and maintain healthy blood pressure levels. Let us now get an idea of what constitutes a low sodium meal. A typical breakfast would include fresh fruit, a cup of skimmed milk or coffee, and low-sodium cereals or wheat bread. Lunch could include low-sodium wheat crackers, skimmed milk, a small cup of unsalted peanuts, and spinach salad. Dinner consisting of boiled potatoes, fresh steamed vegetables, fresh melon or fresh melon juice, and grilled chicken could make an ideal low sodium meal.",

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",
