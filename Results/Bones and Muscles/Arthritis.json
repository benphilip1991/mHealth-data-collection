Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines that are part of many foods we eat.\r\ncrystallization of uric acid compounds in joints can cause painful attack of arthritis, kidney stones, and if not treated carefully may also cause blockage of the kidney filtering tubules with uric acid crystals, leading to kidney failure.\r\nThe small joint at the base of the big toe is the most common site for an attack.\r\nOther joints that can be affected include the ankles, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows. In some patients the acute pain is so intense that even a bed sheet touching the toe causes severe pain.

Certain drugs and diseases can also cause increased levels of uric acid. Also,hypothyroidism patients are at increased risk of developing gout.\r\nEating healthy diet and living a healthy lifestyle may help cope with the situation.\r\nPatients with the high blood uric acid levels are restricted of eating a high protein diet because the purine content in foods like pulses, red meats, full cream dairy products are high. They should strictly avoid organ meats.\r\nMaintaining adequate fluid intake or drinking plenty of water and healthy fluids help prevent gout attacks and decreases the risk of kidney stone formation in people with gout.\r\nFoods rich in vitamin C like lemon, tangerines, oranges also helps in lowering the uric acid levels.\r\nSo eat a healthy and balanced diet, do regular exercising, give proper rest to the site of gout attack.",

They should strictly avoid organ meats.<br>Maintaining adequate fluid intake or drinking plenty of water and healthy fluids help prevent gout attacks and decreases the risk of kidney stone formation in people with gout.<br>Foods rich in vitamin C like lemon, tangerines, oranges also helps in lowering the uric acid levels.<br>So eat a healthy and balanced diet, do regular exercising, give proper rest to the site of gout attack.",

        "description": "Stream or download qigong video lessons to heal your Arthritis symptoms permanently. \r\n‚Ä¢ Get immediate pain relief for your arthritis.\r\n‚Ä¢ New smaller app size!\r\n‚Ä¢ Learn to use qigong to promote healing.\r\nIn this hour-long video app, Master Yang presents gentle qigong exercises to help ease your Arthritis pain and speed your body‚Äôs natural healing. The exercises are simple to learn and enjoyable to practice, and you can easily follow along with Dr. Yang's demonstration. The movements can be practiced sitting or standing. \r\nIn the second half of the program, Dr. Yang offers pain-relieving massage techniques for yourself and with a partner, and shows important pressure points, or acupuncture cavities. A complete self-massage section is included which you may follow along to.  Massage is sometimes necessary to help improve your circulation to speed the healing process.\r\nWhether you want to prevent Arthritis or are suffering from joint pain already, qigong can help you with pain relief and stimulate your healing. For centuries, the Chinese have healed and strengthened their bodies with Qigong (chee-kung), the art of using the mind to direct the energy within your body to improve health and vitality. This program also gives an introduction to the general concepts of qigong and how it pertains to arthritis.\r\n\"Qigong for Arthritis Relief\" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is also available as a DVD, book or ebook. \r\n\r\nLearn details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong to improve your health. \r\nThe flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians. We all have a \"life force\", Qi (energy) within all our trillions of cells, allowing them to function. Qi also regulates physical, emotional, mental and spiritual stability. Qi (ki in Japanese) maintains a homeostatic balance in your body.\r\nThank you for downloading our app!

            "**UPDATE** after receiving response from customer support (which was expedient and right on the money for what I needed). I absolutely LOVE this app!!! (upgrade from 4 stars to 5!!) Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",
            "I started using this app because I know I will need a lengthy history to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I like how easy this app is to use and record my daily symptoms and over all how Im feeling. This app is super helpful.",
            "Love this. Most apps that track your activities etc are very limited without subscribing but this one has a lot of free features and is a great way of keeping track of patterns"

        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints ‚Äî especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths ‚Äî especially in the morning ‚Äî help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n‚úÖ arthritis ‚úÖ\r\n‚úÖ rheumatoid arthritis ‚úÖ\r\n‚úÖ arthritis in hands ‚úÖ\r\n‚úÖ arthritis pain relief ‚úÖ",
        "descriptionHTML": "<b>Arthritis pain:</b> Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.<br><br>Doctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.<br><br><b>1.

I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

Get 10 super easy and effective arthritis pain relief tips from arthritis experts and make your life with arthritis a little easier now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect your joints. Don‚Äôt keep your joints in the same position for a prolonged period of time. Balance your rest and work throughout the day. Use the strongest joints available for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStretch it. Stretching should be part of every arthritis patient‚Äôs daily routine. A good stretch helps prevent injuries by warming up muscles and tendons which are more limber and less likely to tear. Spend at least 10 minutes each day stretching, and work each major muscle group.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCool it down. Stop physical activity. Rest in a cool/shaded environment. Spray with a mist of cool water or wrap an ice pack or cold compress in a towel and apply it to reduce arthritis pain and swelling.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet moving. Exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness and increases flexibility and muscle strength. It can also help with weight control, stress management, and make you feel better overall. The Arthritis Foundation also offers water exercise and other classes.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a massage. Massage therapy can relieve your pain, soothe stiff sore muscles, reduce inflammation and swelling. Make sure you use oil or cream on your fingers to make it mroe gentle. Work the area for five to ten minutes a day if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your weight in balance. Being overweight, even just moderately, impacts weightbearing joints and can increase the pain of arthritis. Studies have indicated that losing extra weight lowers the risk for developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Losing weight can help slow the progression of arthritis too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, swelling for more than 1 weeks, you should consider seeing your doctor and getting a diagnosis. Remember that there are more than 100 types of arthritis. It is important to get the specific diagnosis for the type of arthritis you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake your medication the right way. Don‚Äôt stop taking your medication just because you feel it is not working. Check with your doctor first. You need to understand that it may take several days to several months for a medication to become effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook out for new options. Recently FDA has approved some new drugs for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis diseases. If feel that the current medication doesn‚Äôt work well, check with your doctor about possible new options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep educating yourself. It is important to learn something new about arthritis. Find some good websites online and subscribe to their newsletter if they have it. Join one of two active online arthritis communities like forums or bulletin board. Never hesitate to see your doctors and ask questions.",

        "description": "I am assuming that most of the readers of this article are aware of the basics of arthritis and I am not going into finer details of the disease per se here. This article is dedicated to discussing about the natural remedies for joint pain and hence I will stick to the point.\r\n\r\nConventionally arthritis has been managed with analgesics called as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatories (NSAIDs). NSAIDs cause dangerous side effects like gastric ulceration and they also increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Thus both patients and their doctors are not averse to looking at Mother Nature to help ease the joint pain in arthritis. While natural and herbal remedies are generally free from side effects and are reasonably effective they might interfere with other prescription medications. It is therefore prudent on the part of the patient to check with their doctors first before starting these medications.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole range of natural remedies for joint pain and it would be practically impossible to go through all of them but I will list the ones that are most effective with reasonable scientific backing to their use.\r\n\r\nGlucosamine and Chondroitin: Perhaps no other natural remedy have been as extensively studied as these two. Both Glucosamine and Chondroitin are found naturally occurring in the joints and with wear and tear of the joints these reduce dramatically in an arthritic joint. It is thus appropriate that there should be some relief from joint pains when one substitutes these ingredients in the joint.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids have a wide range of beneficial effects in the human body. Derived from fish oils they reduce inflammation and pain of many chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nBromelain: Derived from the Papaya fruit, Bromelain has shown good anti-inflammatory effect and is an analgesic too.\r\n\r\nMethylSulfonylMethane: MSM occurs naturally in plants and animals and preliminary studies have shown promise as a good analgesic in arthritis.\r\nDevil's claw and Cat's claw: Both these herbs have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and have been used for centuries for their effectiveness not only in arthritis but also in other ailments.\r\n\r\nBoswellia (Indian Frankincense): Regular use of Boswellia improves blood flow to the joints thus resulting in a well-nourished and viable joint tissue. Boswellia has been used in traditional Ayurveda since times immemorial.",

            "Had to uninstall. I could never get it to tell me less than 5 days per week. I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",
            "I was so excited about this app. I finally could do exercises for my specific issues. However the plan never works. My screen goes black right after the welcome video. I'm so disappointed.",
            "The screen is black and the session doesn't move forward properly. It's very frustrating."

        "description": "The Division of Rheumatology at the University of Cape Town is very actively involved in teaching, service delivery and research.\r\n\r\nTeaching is directed at medical students in their 4th 5th and 6th years of training. There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu‚Äôs Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC‚Äôs; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nMany different conditions can lead to painful joints, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, gout, strains, sprains, and other injuries. Joint pain is extremely common. In one national survey, about one-third of adults reported having joint pain within the past 30 days.

As you get older, painful joints become increasingly more common.\r\n\r\nJoint pain can range from mildly irritating to debilitating. It may go away after a few weeks (acute), or last for several weeks or months (chronic). Even short-term pain and swelling in the joints can affect your quality of life.

With age, arthritis can cause the joints in our knees, hands, wrists, and feet to become stiff and sore.\r\n\r\nArthritis also affects the vertebrae in our neck, which get worn down from years of supporting our head. After age 60, more than 85 percent of people have arthritis in their neck, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).\r\n\r\nIf your neck is sore, see a doctor to find out exactly what‚Äôs causing your pain. You can visit your family doctor or see a specialist like an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or osteopathic doctor. Your doctor can also advise you on therapies to help relieve the pain such as postural changes, physical therapy, yoga, or Pilates. And your doctor may recommend pain relieving medication or steroid injections.\r\n\r\nYou can also try basic exercises at home. Though you might be tempted to keep your neck still when it hurts, staying immobile will only increase the stiffness. It will also cause you to lose even more movement. Stretching and strengthening exercises will help keep your neck limber and reduce your arthritis pain.\r\n\r\nHere are a few exercises you can try for relieving neck arthritis. Remember to move gently and smoothly through each exercise. Never make any sudden movements or jerk your neck. Twisting and turning your neck is done in the neck rotation exercise. Also, stop if any exercise increases your neck pain.",

Update 4.5 adds some edits to the General Help screen that refreshed and expanded the instructions for all of the app&#39;s features. To learn more, tap the info button in the top-left corner of the home screen and choose General Help.",

            "I bought this app thinking it would help me track my chronic pain but having to restart my drawings all the time because they don't save makes me waste a lot of time. App would have potential. I like that you can draw on the front and back of the body. But having to spend so much time on the app redoing what I had already done just doesn't do it for me.",
            "Good features for drawing pain on diagram. Deducted star: Would like to see the title of a pain type next to the icons, rather than having to remember what each square represents. Would like to see a summary mode with both front/back entry side by side (with legend) and notes included at bottom. Right now to summarize properly requires 3 screenshots--front, back, and notes. Edit: excellent update. Added the above feature. Very good. Bit buried, so may be something you want to make more obvious.",
            "Where is the female body choice? That is not \"androgynous\", it's male without the dangly bits. Add a female (or actual androgynous body like other pain apps) option for a higher rating. Also, can I setup a notification to remind me to enter data every day?",
            "This app is a must have tool for anyone who lives with chronic pain. It is very intuitive and user friendly. Using this tool regularly gives you the voice and language, through pictures and words, for what you've been trying to express. It speaks in a way that both medical professionals and families/friends understand. If you are a chronic pain warrior - you will never be without this amazing and powerful app!!",
            "Fantastic app! My doctors find it very, very helpful and it's very easy to add entries on the fly. My only suggestion is to make the playback feature switch automatically between front and back views. It's confusing to the doctor when an entry appears blank because it's on the other side. Kudos to the developers though. They did a fantastic job with this one."

        "description": "Have you had an ACL injury or surgery, a Knee Replacement or a Hip Replacement? This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\r\n \r\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work.\r\n \r\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\r\n \r\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app.\r\n \r\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\r\n \r\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\r\n \r\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don‚Äôt have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\r\n \r\nTotal Hip Replacement - the main purpose of the surgery is to eliminate the pain that people feel from osteoarthritis of the hip joint. The hip surgery was the first and very important step to restoring hip joint movement, reducing hip pain and allowing you to return to your physically active self. However, there is a great deal of rehabilitation and recovery that has to happen after your hip replacement.  If you have had this surgery, Curovate can help you recover. There are daily exercises, important things that you have to do to get better, instructions from your surgeon of what positions to avoid and all of this  information can be very overwhelming and confusing. Curovate simplifies the process of rehabilitation and provides you with daily guidance directly on your phone.",

Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",

        "description": "What Are the Causes of Low Back Pain?\r\nStrains\r\n\r\nThe muscles and ligaments in the back can stretch or tear due to excess activity. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the lower back, as well as muscle spasms. Rest and physical therapy are remedies for these symptoms.\r\nDisc Injury\r\n\r\nThe discs in the back are prone to injury, and this risk increases with age. The outside of the disc can tear or herniate. A herniated disc (also known as a slipped or ruptured disc) occurs when the cartilage surrounding the disc pushes against the spinal cord or nerve roots. The cushion that sits between the spinal vertebrae extends outside its normal position. This can result in compression of the nerve root as it exits from the spinal cord and through the vertebral bones. Disc injury usually occurs suddenly after lifting something or twisting the back. Unlike a back strain, pain from a disc injury usually lasts for more than 72 hours.\r\nSciatica\r\n\r\nSciatica can occur with a herniated disc if the disc presses on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spine to the legs. As a result, sciatica can cause pain in the legs and feet. This pain usually feels like burning or pins and needles.\r\nSpinal Stenosis\r\n\r\nSpinal stenosis is when the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Spinal stenosis is most commonly due to degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae. The result is compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or soft tissues, such as discs. Pressure on the spinal nerves causes symptoms such as numbness, cramping, and weakness. You might feel these symptoms anywhere in the body. Many people with spinal stenosis notice their symptoms worsen when standing or walking.\r\nAbnormal Spine Curvatures\r\n\r\nScoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis are all conditions that cause abnormal curvatures in the spine. These are congenital conditions and are usually first diagnosed when patients are children and teenagers. The abnormal curvature places pressure on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and vertebrae, causing pain and poor posture.\r\nOther Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other conditions that cause lower back pain. These conditions include arthritis, fibromyalgia (long-term pain and tenderness in the joints, muscles, and tendons), spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spinal bones), and spondylosis (a degenerative disorder that may cause loss of normal spinal structure and function). Although aging is the primary cause of spondylosis, the location and rate of degeneration is individual.\r\n\r\nKidney and bladder problems, pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and cancer can also cause low back pain.\r\n\r\nread more just download our app now \r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain app :\r\n\r\n- symptoms\r\n- signs\r\n- Risk and Prevention\r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- symptom \r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‚ú∞‚ú∞‚ú∞ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ ‚ú∞‚ú∞‚ú∞\r\n‚ú∞‚ú∞‚ú∞ Please contact us first if you have any question! ‚ú∞‚ú∞‚ú∞",

        "description": "Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body. This reaction leads to swelling and a quicker turnover of skin cells.

They pile up, forming itchy, red patches.\r\n\r\nIt can develop at any age, but usually occurs in people between 15 and 35 years old. The main symptoms include itchy, red patches of thick skin with silvery scales on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms, and feet.\r\n\r\nPsoriasis can be irritating and stressful. Creams, ointments, medications, and light therapy may help. However, some research suggests diet might also alleviate symptoms.\r\n\r\nSo far, research on diet and psoriasis is limited. Still, some small studies have provided clues into how food may affect the disease.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1969, scientists looked into a potential connection.

Several conditions are covered, like rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, microcrystalline arthritis (gout), lupus (SLE), osteoarthritis, etc. The benefits for the patients are numerous: reduce the frequency of visits to the rheumatologist (in agreement with the rheumatologist), detect earlier the failure/inefficacy of an ongoing treatment, and thus earlier adpatation of the therapeutic strategy. This adds up naturally to the fact that the user has an objective idea of his/her status with respect to a rheumatic condition and its evolution over time, which in itself is a benefit. The app thus really allows to follow the \"treat-to-target\" trend. This mobile application can be connected to RheumaKit.com, a web platform for personalized medicine in Rheumatology to be used by the clinicians. Each clinician can store a much larger collection of information of interest regarding each patient. The types of information that can be managed by the clinicians are related to treatment, to diagnosis or to disease activity and can include biological and even genomic testing. Currently, the mobile application allows the follow-up of the user via three self-reported metrics: the simplified Health Assessment Questionaire (HAQ-DI), the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). These three indices allow for the monitoring of the disease activity.",

        "description": "Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the connective tissue which supports the arch of the foot. It results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot that is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin. The pain typically comes on gradually, and it affects both feet in about one third of cases. \r\nThe causes of plantar fasciitis are not entirely clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot, a tight Achilles tendon, and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear if they have a role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. Since inflammation plays either a lesser or no role, a review proposed it be renamed plantar fasciosis The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms; ultrasound is sometimes useful. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Heel Pain symptoms, Heel Pain Management & Heel Pain causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Heel Pain Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "description": "With the passing of time, we do not realize the amount of stress our bodies goes through. We tend to ignore the wear our body withstands. The knee, especially, on which the body weight stands, and which aids us in movements for our day-to-day actions, is one of the essential areas of your body that is impacted. Due to its nature this body joint tends to go through some form of suffering if not taken care of. There are several home remedies that can help you end the pain and discomfort of chronic knee pain.\r\n\r\nElderly people face a lot of problems like arthritis, among other things, that result in suffering. If the knee joint problem is not taken care of over a time period, it can cause huge and intense suffering. However, immediate attention and regular knee pain remedies can reduce this issue.\r\n\r\nToday, there are many herbal solutions prescribed by medical experts but one should refer to a doctor to know which one suits them best. One of the best known home remedy solutions is known as PRICE. PRICE stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Pressure and Level. This is one of the widely accepted home solutions that is followed to end suffering.\r\n\r\nUsing products that contain relaxing essential oils can lessen the suffering due to injury or inflammation. Avoid using excess cream that may cause discomfort due to high temperatures that may burn the skin. Do exercises for your painful joints that target muscle mass around the knee and help in building up the muscle mass. While doing stretches be sure to go slow and do not over stretch as it may split a muscle. Proper and consistent use of the muscle mass that maintains the knee with exercise routines is the most vital thing to do to look after your legs from harm or injury. Weak and worn out muscle masses can't sustain the knee joint or act as a shock-absorber for the knee.\r\n\r\nWhen you experience a cramp, stretch the impacted muscle with one palm while you massage the center of the knee using your alternate palm. Then you should walk it out. Once an acute cramp is realized, steer clear of doing heavy routines right away. As an alternative, take a stroll for a few minutes to maintain the blood circulation back to the legs. You can also make a substance using castor, turmeric extract mixed in resolved butter or wheat. This paste can then be applied to the joint.\r\n\r\nBeing overweight is also one of the major reasons for knee joint pain and hence losing those excess pounds can help you to get rid of the chronic suffering. Try running, walking, or swimming, or whatever you are comfortable with and stay fit to steer clear of pain.

        "descriptionHTML": "With the passing of time, we do not realize the amount of stress our bodies goes through. We tend to ignore the wear our body withstands. The knee, especially, on which the body weight stands, and which aids us in movements for our day-to-day actions, is one of the essential areas of your body that is impacted. Due to its nature this body joint tends to go through some form of suffering if not taken care of. There are several home remedies that can help you end the pain and discomfort of chronic knee pain.<br><br>Elderly people face a lot of problems like arthritis, among other things, that result in suffering. If the knee joint problem is not taken care of over a time period, it can cause huge and intense suffering. However, immediate attention and regular knee pain remedies can reduce this issue.<br><br>Today, there are many herbal solutions prescribed by medical experts but one should refer to a doctor to know which one suits them best. One of the best known home remedy solutions is known as PRICE. PRICE stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Pressure and Level. This is one of the widely accepted home solutions that is followed to end suffering.<br><br>Using products that contain relaxing essential oils can lessen the suffering due to injury or inflammation. Avoid using excess cream that may cause discomfort due to high temperatures that may burn the skin. Do exercises for your painful joints that target muscle mass around the knee and help in building up the muscle mass. While doing stretches be sure to go slow and do not over stretch as it may split a muscle. Proper and consistent use of the muscle mass that maintains the knee with exercise routines is the most vital thing to do to look after your legs from harm or injury. Weak and worn out muscle masses can&#39;t sustain the knee joint or act as a shock-absorber for the knee.<br><br>When you experience a cramp, stretch the impacted muscle with one palm while you massage the center of the knee using your alternate palm. Then you should walk it out. Once an acute cramp is realized, steer clear of doing heavy routines right away. As an alternative, take a stroll for a few minutes to maintain the blood circulation back to the legs. You can also make a substance using castor, turmeric extract mixed in resolved butter or wheat. This paste can then be applied to the joint.<br><br>Being overweight is also one of the major reasons for knee joint pain and hence losing those excess pounds can help you to get rid of the chronic suffering. Try running, walking, or swimming, or whatever you are comfortable with and stay fit to steer clear of pain. During the winter, keep your knee heated and warm by using a wintergreen treatment as it produces a high temperature and reduces pain. If it&#39;s not adequate, then wrap your legs with heated clothes after applying the treatment.<br><br>Always consult experts before opting for any home remedies for knee pain as your knees are a significant part of your body and helps with body movements and other essential actions.",

Some of the bad reviews are from people who \"need more protein, or swoleness, or Chad talk\"... Because this app has 4 exercises repeated everyday starting easy and getting more difficult. 2. ItS tOo HaRd! Are most of the other reviews. Because for some reason, people think that \"using their muscles\" IsN't ThEiR lIfE sTyLe.. Great app! 10/10",

        "description": "How to Relieve Back Pain\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you bent the wrong way while lifting something heavy. Or you're dealing with a degenerative condition like arthritis. Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it‚Äôs clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.\r\n\r\nChill it. Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.\r\n\r\nKeep moving. Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.\r\n\r\nStay strong. Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.\r\n\r\nWays to Manage Low Back Pain at Home\r\n\r\nSleep Better: When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. \r\n\r\nGood Posture: Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. \r\n\r\nPhysical Therapy\r\nPhysical therapists can teach you how to sit, stand, and move in a way that keeps your spine in proper alignment and alleviates strain on your back.\r\n\r\n‚úÖ back pain relief\r\n‚úÖ lower back pain relief\r\n‚úÖ sciatica relief\r\n‚úÖ sciatic nerve relief",

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

        "recentChanges": "You can enjoy the new Smart Coach now, with 7 categories and over 400 sessions waiting for serving your personal preference.<br>1. SCHEDULE supports the retake of missed sessions in history now. Try and get more circles.<br>2. Another upgrade! Tap the screen to check the pose list while exercising. It&#39;s much easier to browse and switch poses now.<br>3. New Courses in November: Winter Energy Flow-Intermediate Element Yoga, Easy Morning Yoga.<br>Monthly Golden Day, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday are coming!",
        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "This app uses a pretty basic interface and lacks the flashy polish of other to-do list apps. However this is the only spoon energy management app available and does what it says on the tin. Users create activities or choose from presets, and assign spoon values to them. As users complete their to-do lists, the app subtracts the spoon values of each activity from the days' spoons as set by the user. The app also includes a mood tracker. The developer Rob is friendly and responsive.",
            "This app helps me plan and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I often need to manage my work life balance, and this app helps accommodate my goals. The design is concise and easy to use. I recommend using this app, especially if you want to maintain a balance and healthy lifestyle.",
            "I really like this app as a tool for spoonies to keep track of our energy spending. It helps plan my day ahead based on how I feel. I wish it would track mood and match spoons accordingly. Also a widget would be nice. But I highly recommend it.",
            "Well done on the most recent update: app much smoother & less glitchy :) Love the option to create activities that add spoons (such as self care). PLEASE look to develop a homescreen widget so the app needn't be launched to log spoon usage and so spoon counter is always available at a glance! Would love that.",
            "I loved this app when I first got it, but I have no access to settings, so all I can do is add and subtract activities. I just uninstalled and downloaded it again from the app store, and it looks exactly the same. Please tell me what happened!"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Gout is due to elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due to a combination of diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus.

Our app helps you start safely - and keep getting stronger for life. \r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs important that men and women workout as we get older - 40+, 50+ and beyond - to avoid or manage chronic conditions. Typical fitness apps can only help men & women workout if they have no serious health challenges. They often have disclaimers excluding those who need exercise most. Like people with diabetes, heart disease, arthritis or high blood pressure. Their idea of a ‚Äúbeginner workout‚Äù can be too challenging for real beginners. They don‚Äôt include senior exercise, or seated workouts or a workout for obese people to make fitness truly accessible.  \r\n\r\nIn version 1 of our app, we started with Parkinson‚Äôs exercises.

Men and women workout with our app to gain functional fitness & just do life better.

Not just cardio or strength training. Our app includes stretching & flexibility exercises, as well as moves that improve balance & coordination - extremely important for senior fitness. Seated workout for obese people who need to work up to standing moves. \r\n\r\nWellthon offers men and women workouts to build healthy habits and support a more active lifestyle. Get back to the activities you love with more energy. Sleep better & reduce pain and inflammation with knee pain relief & back pain relief exercises. Manage chronic health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, joint pain, and high blood pressure.

Wellthon was designed with the help of a certified exercise physiologist and OhioHealth experts in a range of conditions.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

        "description": "Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomas. The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Any organ, however, can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often there are no, or only mild, symptoms. When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Some may have L√∂fgren syndrome in which there is fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk.  Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the blood. The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.",

If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.üòÄüòÄ"

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

        "description": "Kyphosis (from Greek Œ∫œÖœÜœåœÇ kyphos, a hump) is an abnormally excessive convex kyphotic curvature of the spine as it occurs in the cervical, thoracic and sacral regions. (Abnormal inward concave lordotic curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis.) Kyphosis can be called roundback or Kelso's hunchback. It can result from degenerative diseases such as arthritis; developmental problems, most commonly Scheuermann's disease; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; multiple myeloma or trauma. A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st to the 12th vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20¬∞ to 45¬∞. When the \"roundness\" of the upper spine increases past 45¬∞ it is called kyphosis or \"hyperkyphosis\". Scheuermann's kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females. In the sense of a deformity, it is the pathological curving of the spine, where parts of the spinal column lose some or all of their lordotic profile. This causes a bowing of the back, seen as a slouching posture.",

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world‚Äî if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

Of these two, hypothyroidism is the most common. Doctors are aware of six basic symptoms of hypothyroidism; weight gain, dry skin and hair, hoarse voice, fatigue, cold intolerance and puffy facial feature, but these symptoms are minor compared to the effects thyroid deficiency can have on the body since every cell in the body needs thyroid hormone.  Many people whose blood results are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù have debilitating symptoms of hypothyroidism and no hope of any help from the medical profession. Yet, if left untreated, you put yourself at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, emphysema, arthritis, depression, migraine, and carpal tunnel syndrome. There are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many ‚Äì but not all ‚Äì people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to improve thyroid function is increasingly common; Traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their thyroid disease with alternative techniques. There are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments.  This app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over you thyroid problems and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself. However one may need Medical or Expert advice for certain protocols.

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. üëç"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10üåü....",

But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",

Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",

Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",

            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

Use in elderly patients and the use of certain medications with Otezla appears to increase the risk of having diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Tell your doctor if any of these conditions occur. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOtezla is associated with an increase in depression. In clinical studies, some patients reported depression, or suicidal behavior while taking Otezla. Some patients stopped taking Otezla due to depression. Before starting Otezla, tell your doctor if you have had feelings of depression, or suicidal thoughts or behavior. Be sure to tell your doctor if any of these symptoms or other mood changes develop or worsen during treatment with Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome patients taking Otezla lost body weight. Your doctor should monitor your weight regularly. If unexplained or significant weight loss occurs, your doctor will decide if you should continue taking Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome medicines may make Otezla less effective, and should not be taken with Otezla. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSide effects of Otezla include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, runny nose, sneezing, or congestion, abdominal pain, tension headache, and headache. These are not all the possible side effects with Otezla. Ask your doctor about other potential side effects. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or planning to breastfeed. Otezla has not been studied in pregnant women or in women who are breastfeeding. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-332-1088. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease see Full Prescribing Information at www.otezla.com/otezla-prescribing-information.pdf. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a reminder, only you and your doctor can determine what treatment is right for you.

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for ¬£2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for.

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

        "description": "Causes and risk factors of osteoarthritis\r\n\r\nIn osteoarthritis, the destruction of the cartilage corresponds to a cracking of the surface towards the depth of the cartilaginous tissue. This cracking is related to mechanical phenomena, but it is also favored by biochemical alterations of the cartilage structure.\r\n\r\nSchematically, we can consider that osteoarthritis is the result:\r\n\r\n    Abnormal physical stresses on normal cartilage;\r\n    Normal physical stresses on abnormal cartilage;\r\n    From the conjunction of the two previous situations.\r\n\r\nThe main suspected risk factors are:\r\n\r\n    General: age, weight, menopause, other rheumatism (chondrocalcinosis, Forestier hyperostosis ...);\r\n    Genetics: the concept of familial osteoarthritis is well proven for arthrosis of the knee, hip and hand;\r\n     Local :\r\n        Significant or weak trauma to repetition (hard work, violent sports, meniscus lesions ...);\r\n        Abnormal position of the joint (scoliosis, malformation of the hip, ...);\r\n        Other localized bone or joint diseases (sequelae of arthritis, sequelae of fractures, Paget's disease ...).\r\n\r\nAt the origin of osteoarthritis are many factors that are often still poorly understood. However, the genetic character of the condition appears to be predominant. There are families of osteoarthritis and the disease affects women more often than men. For example, if some occupations (forced labor) are more exposed to osteoarthritis than others, not all members of this occupation will develop osteoarthritis (in part based on their genetic predisposition).\r\n\r\nScreening for congenital joint abnormalities, followed by correction in childhood, is of paramount importance to prevent the onset of painful osteoarthritis in adulthood.\r\n\r\nObesity (or simple overweight) is undoubtedly a factor favoring the appearance of osteoarthritis in the hips and especially the knees.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, read our article on risk factors for osteoarthritis.\r\nThe symptoms of osteoarthritis\r\n\r\nThe signs of osteoarthritis vary according to the joint concerned. However, in all cases, the main reason for consultation is pain associated with functional impairment.\r\n\r\nThe pain is, in principle, called \"mechanical\" because it has the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n    It is triggered and aggravated by movement;\r\n    It ceases or diminishes more or less completely when the joint is at rest;\r\n    It is less important in the morning, then increases during the day and is highest in the evening;\r\n    It usually hinders falling asleep, but can also lead to nocturnal awakenings (about 50% of osteoarthritis patients are woken at night by their pain);\r\n    It reappears each time the affected joint is subjected to an effort: walking for osteoarthritis hip, climb a stair for the knee, lift the arm for the shoulder ...\r\n\r\nFunctional discomfort is a limitation of mobility of the joint affected by osteoarthritis. It is variable according to the activity of the patient. Thus, a golf player will be much more embarrassed by osteoarthritis of the knee than a subject not practicing any sport. Just as a pianist will be very handicapped by even slight osteoarthritis of the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe osteoarthritic joints are, in principle, neither red nor hot. They can be swollen when a fluid effusion (effusion of synovium) is established, which is particularly common in the knees.

This cracking is related to mechanical phenomena, but it is also favored by biochemical alterations of the cartilage structure.<br><br>Schematically, we can consider that osteoarthritis is the result:<br><br>    Abnormal physical stresses on normal cartilage;<br>    Normal physical stresses on abnormal cartilage;<br>    From the conjunction of the two previous situations.<br><br>The main suspected risk factors are:<br><br>    General: age, weight, menopause, other rheumatism (chondrocalcinosis, Forestier hyperostosis ...);<br>    Genetics: the concept of familial osteoarthritis is well proven for arthrosis of the knee, hip and hand;<br>     Local :<br>        Significant or weak trauma to repetition (hard work, violent sports, meniscus lesions ...);<br>        Abnormal position of the joint (scoliosis, malformation of the hip, ...);<br>        Other localized bone or joint diseases (sequelae of arthritis, sequelae of fractures, Paget&#39;s disease ...).<br><br>At the origin of osteoarthritis are many factors that are often still poorly understood. However, the genetic character of the condition appears to be predominant. There are families of osteoarthritis and the disease affects women more often than men. For example, if some occupations (forced labor) are more exposed to osteoarthritis than others, not all members of this occupation will develop osteoarthritis (in part based on their genetic predisposition).<br><br>Screening for congenital joint abnormalities, followed by correction in childhood, is of paramount importance to prevent the onset of painful osteoarthritis in adulthood.<br><br>Obesity (or simple overweight) is undoubtedly a factor favoring the appearance of osteoarthritis in the hips and especially the knees.<br><br>To learn more, read our article on risk factors for osteoarthritis.<br>The symptoms of osteoarthritis<br><br>The signs of osteoarthritis vary according to the joint concerned. However, in all cases, the main reason for consultation is pain associated with functional impairment.<br><br>The pain is, in principle, called &quot;mechanical&quot; because it has the following characteristics:<br><br>    It is triggered and aggravated by movement;<br>    It ceases or diminishes more or less completely when the joint is at rest;<br>    It is less important in the morning, then increases during the day and is highest in the evening;<br>    It usually hinders falling asleep, but can also lead to nocturnal awakenings (about 50% of osteoarthritis patients are woken at night by their pain);<br>    It reappears each time the affected joint is subjected to an effort: walking for osteoarthritis hip, climb a stair for the knee, lift the arm for the shoulder ...<br><br>Functional discomfort is a limitation of mobility of the joint affected by osteoarthritis. It is variable according to the activity of the patient. Thus, a golf player will be much more embarrassed by osteoarthritis of the knee than a subject not practicing any sport. Just as a pianist will be very handicapped by even slight osteoarthritis of the fingers.<br><br>The osteoarthritic joints are, in principle, neither red nor hot. They can be swollen when a fluid effusion (effusion of synovium) is established, which is particularly common in the knees. However, periods of inflammatory growth exist and there would be an inflammatory component in this disease, different and less important than that of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>Learn more Free download.",

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time.

That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",

Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"
