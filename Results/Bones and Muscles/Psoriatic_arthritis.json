Don’t ignore this symptom!\r\n\r\nIn fact, I stress that last symptom because it is the most insidious one when it comes to psoriatic arthritis!

        "description": "Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues in the body. This reaction leads to swelling and a quicker turnover of skin cells.

They pile up, forming itchy, red patches.\r\n\r\nIt can develop at any age, but usually occurs in people between 15 and 35 years old. The main symptoms include itchy, red patches of thick skin with silvery scales on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms, and feet.\r\n\r\nPsoriasis can be irritating and stressful. Creams, ointments, medications, and light therapy may help. However, some research suggests diet might also alleviate symptoms.\r\n\r\nSo far, research on diet and psoriasis is limited. Still, some small studies have provided clues into how food may affect the disease.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1969, scientists looked into a potential connection.

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",

There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

            "It would be helpful if multiple joints could be selected at the same time when logging symptoms, sometimes when dexterity is more limited, selecting the individual joints and manually documenting is difficult. A food diary would be great too, too track things like gluten, dairy and nightshades",
            "There's a pop up or a bug that is making editing previous days rather difficult. I like this app otherwise. I'd also like to copy and paste symptoms from previous days or copy symptoms from one side and paste it to the other side. I typically have the same issues in both sides and it would be nice to save me extra taps."

        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints — especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths — especially in the morning — help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n✅ arthritis ✅\r\n✅ rheumatoid arthritis ✅\r\n✅ arthritis in hands ✅\r\n✅ arthritis pain relief ✅",

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to prevent and combat RA and its symptoms. If you rather tackle health issues through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you! Last data update: Nov. 2019.\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with RA:\r\n \r\n- Anemia (iron deficiency)\r\n- Depression\r\n- Excess body weight or obesity\r\n- Heart disease\r\n- High blood pressure\r\n- High cholesterol\r\n- Joints well-being\r\n- Osteoporosis \r\n- Stress\r\n- Vitamin D deficiency\r\n\r\nAlso included are comprehensive guidelines on autoimmunity including detoxification, anti-inflammation, leaky gut and Microbiome health diets.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Recipes. Most popular recipes on leading web sites.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nSuggestions presented in this app are based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market, based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“As an orthopedic surgeon, I love that my patients stay engaged in their health and actively see what foods they should consume and avoid, using their smart device.”\r\nBruce Gomberg, MD\r\nOrthopedic Surgeon",

            "To me, the app was not user-friendly. I found myself entering the same information repeatedly and sometimes the data just would not save (specifically in the Goals section). Second, the format provides low visibility. I was looking for something thst displays data like a calendar with icons and notes to show my doctors an overall picture of my health for each day. This is more like a database that has to be searched by individual criteria. I can't use this app in its current format.",

        "description": "I am assuming that most of the readers of this article are aware of the basics of arthritis and I am not going into finer details of the disease per se here. This article is dedicated to discussing about the natural remedies for joint pain and hence I will stick to the point.\r\n\r\nConventionally arthritis has been managed with analgesics called as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatories (NSAIDs). NSAIDs cause dangerous side effects like gastric ulceration and they also increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Thus both patients and their doctors are not averse to looking at Mother Nature to help ease the joint pain in arthritis. While natural and herbal remedies are generally free from side effects and are reasonably effective they might interfere with other prescription medications. It is therefore prudent on the part of the patient to check with their doctors first before starting these medications.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole range of natural remedies for joint pain and it would be practically impossible to go through all of them but I will list the ones that are most effective with reasonable scientific backing to their use.\r\n\r\nGlucosamine and Chondroitin: Perhaps no other natural remedy have been as extensively studied as these two. Both Glucosamine and Chondroitin are found naturally occurring in the joints and with wear and tear of the joints these reduce dramatically in an arthritic joint. It is thus appropriate that there should be some relief from joint pains when one substitutes these ingredients in the joint.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids have a wide range of beneficial effects in the human body. Derived from fish oils they reduce inflammation and pain of many chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nBromelain: Derived from the Papaya fruit, Bromelain has shown good anti-inflammatory effect and is an analgesic too.\r\n\r\nMethylSulfonylMethane: MSM occurs naturally in plants and animals and preliminary studies have shown promise as a good analgesic in arthritis.\r\nDevil's claw and Cat's claw: Both these herbs have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and have been used for centuries for their effectiveness not only in arthritis but also in other ailments.\r\n\r\nBoswellia (Indian Frankincense): Regular use of Boswellia improves blood flow to the joints thus resulting in a well-nourished and viable joint tissue.

        "description": "Think you can’t stop that arthritis pain? Great news! You can act now. Get 10 super easy and effective arthritis pain relief tips from arthritis experts and make your life with arthritis a little easier now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect your joints. Don’t keep your joints in the same position for a prolonged period of time. Balance your rest and work throughout the day. Use the strongest joints available for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStretch it. Stretching should be part of every arthritis patient’s daily routine. A good stretch helps prevent injuries by warming up muscles and tendons which are more limber and less likely to tear. Spend at least 10 minutes each day stretching, and work each major muscle group. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCool it down. Stop physical activity. Rest in a cool/shaded environment. Spray with a mist of cool water or wrap an ice pack or cold compress in a towel and apply it to reduce arthritis pain and swelling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet moving. Exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness and increases flexibility and muscle strength. It can also help with weight control, stress management, and make you feel better overall.

Use in elderly patients and the use of certain medications with Otezla appears to increase the risk of having diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Tell your doctor if any of these conditions occur. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOtezla is associated with an increase in depression. In clinical studies, some patients reported depression, or suicidal behavior while taking Otezla. Some patients stopped taking Otezla due to depression.

Be sure to tell your doctor if any of these symptoms or other mood changes develop or worsen during treatment with Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome patients taking Otezla lost body weight. Your doctor should monitor your weight regularly. If unexplained or significant weight loss occurs, your doctor will decide if you should continue taking Otezla. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome medicines may make Otezla less effective, and should not be taken with Otezla. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSide effects of Otezla include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, runny nose, sneezing, or congestion, abdominal pain, tension headache, and headache. These are not all the possible side effects with Otezla. Ask your doctor about other potential side effects. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or planning to breastfeed.

And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together. And you can even have your family see if you’ve missed a med despite the pill reminder, so they can help you stay on track.\r\nMyTherapy is for you, no matter if you are taking antibiotic medicines or deal with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression that are often complicated.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "I love this game, it is a good one, but lately I have found a lot of server connection errors specially in this last update so try to fix this problem as soon as you can. I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard. (Not all) > Don't forget to enjoy!!! #ComeToOurClanWeDoHelpEachOther. III % (Clan Name)"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "comments": [
            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "It was a great app. I had a few different tunings purchased. But now I am unable to restore my purchases. Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",
            "It actually tuned my guitar!!! also has loads of fun interactive games that help you learn/master chords",
            "Honestly this app is amazing no ads and pretty on point with tuning your guitar. Also have had no problems so far, and you don't even need to pay for the tuning part. Really recommend this for someone who is just starting out on playing guitar and wants to learn how to tune your guitar. Definitely 5 star! :)"

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

            "Grow castle is an amazing game. They are constantly fixing bugs and adding new enemies and hero's to the game. They have clans so you can play multiplayer and chat with other people about the game and you can continue having fun for a long time as they have dragon/boss fights that continue up to months past you're download of the game. It can be played competitively and casually and overall it's a game that I think everyone should download at least once. I think they should add more music.",
            "I like this because there is not adds. The only time there are adds is if you need coins. If you are also tired of playing these other games that are the same then play GrowCastle . Its fun and active you can join groups and try to be the best group. I play Growcastle when I am bored. I like this game a lot so i think you shuold play it. This is why I am giving it a 5 star rating",
            "Ive played this game for years, and still enjoy playing it. Im on wave somewhere in the thousands now and i still enjoy it. Even at big levels its not really grindy and there isnt many ads at all and you almost have to pay for nothing other than a few things. Though i would really like some new game macanics like just more heros or maybe more things to fight. But more than that there should maybe be more town stuff. I would like more stuff that gets unlocked and changes the game more often.",
            "This game is the best RPG game-type ever! This game has no add pop-ups at ramdom time which is like Tap Titans 2. You must watch an add if needed 3× game speed or free coins. I play this game Grow Castle if I'm bored playing other games. This game makes me addicted like literally can't stop playing this game all day! I love the graphics, controls and even the gameplay! I'd rate this a 5 star for this game! 🤩",
            "I'd say its fun, really simple when you start and once you understand the game it gets more complicated which is great because you don't get overwhelmed. its well paced and a good game to get if you're just looking to try something new. especially because it's not littered with ads you can't avoid. all ads are optional."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "This game is amazing. I love the fact that you can play offline. And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

            "This game is good! It's like csgo but in mobile. The game is perfect. But I would suggests adding voice chat, molotov and make more maps. But don't rush it, just take your time to do it. I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",

I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different. Plunge into a whole series of adventures, going down into the city subway, traveling to the mountains and national parks on the edge of the city, and venturing through the wasteland, all while shooting your way through hordes of the walking dead.\r\n\r\nRPG AND SURVIVAL\r\nPrey Day is one of the most dangerous zombie survival games full of players who may have different goals and methods of survival - run, shoot, defend, team up, target, and fight real players fighting for survival just like you. Shooting games challenge your skill, speed, and reaction time, and when you're fighting for survival, you'll do everything you can not to die. With both co op and PVP elements, you can communicate and unite with friends, or oppose and kill competitors - the best traditions of MMO and online multiplayer games!",

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

        "comments": [
            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "It was one of the the best app among the others few years back. Used it for my pregnancy 3 years ago. Now for my second pregnancy downloaded it and all could see is unwanted upgrading ads ,every article i open requires a premium upgrade. Looks like all it cares about is how to make money.its super super annoying. Uninstalling it.",
            "Kinda hard to navigate and constantly pulling up the premium ads. Deleted it ultimately because every time i tried to read about my week; i was confounded by stories of miscarriage that triggered my anxiety over previous loss and got me scared and worried. I started not using it and then deleted over that.",
            "I love this app, and truly feel that the premium option is worth it. Many people are quick to dismiss paid for apps, but they forget the team behind the platform, which lead me through when I didn't want to conceive, to now - half way through my pregnancy. I get excited to check my daily update on my pregnancy journey: supported by great articles relating to every single day of pregnancy, and a community to chat with, along with smart analysis. Thanks Glow, keep up the great work!",
            "This is a pretty good app for being free besides all the ads to upgrade. I can log things I do like water intake, if I take my prenatal, how much sleep I get, etc. It also gives updates about my baby and what stage he/she is in and each week compares its size to food 😄 I like that there are articles I can read and there are other people in the same stage at me on this so it's like we're all in this together ❤"

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

This app does a great job at extracting files that have been compressed, and supports all the common compression algorithms. In my opinion it is the best on android, even better than some paid options. I appreciate how it all I am not constantly reminded to give it a rating or upgrade to a paid option. I would highly recommend this app.",
            "VERY nice and good app user freindly interface. The best file manager in the universe. Mind blowing and very very outstanding app. HAs a lot of features like dark mode light mode and i recommend everybody to download it. The reason for giving 4 stars is it is missing one thing. Literally this file manager is missing one thing that many people. Literally it does not have Root explorer. After a few months of my old review they have even added root explorer now. Now you deserve 5 stars man. LOVE",

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

        "comments": [
            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "When I run AV, it says \"risk found\". Doesn't tell me what the risk is, where it is, what to do about it. So your AV just finds the problems but doesn't do anything about them? According to the developer, it's supposed to tell you which file is affected but it has told me nothing but that a \"Risk Found\"... that's it, nothing else. Not helpful and it doesn't get rid of the problem, so the app remains useless. Still one star.",
            "AVG gives really comprehensive virus protection for free. OK there's ads which I'm prepared to put up with and actually some are interesting. AVG also offers extra protection (which isn't free) like secure VPN but the costs of the extras don't seem to be that much. There's also an AVG deep clean app which is free and that's also very good. All in all I'm very happy.",
            "All services I have ever used with AVG have run smoothly and performed as advertised and promised. I am using the free service now b/c of pandemic budget issues. I eagerly await the time that I can enjoy and feel even more secure and protected with the bundled pay services. Customer service over the years I have used AVG services has ALWAYS been warm, professional, , and acutely knowlegable about their products. Impecable service apprecited beyond compare = THANK YOU!!!",
            "One of my apps sends a PopUp with a message that my service provider UICC is not valid every 3 minutes!!! Very annoying! But otherwise, my phone works perfectly well, and nothing is wrong with the UICC. I purchased AVG antivirus pro, and AVG Cleanup, and NONE of them identified the issue nor fixed it! I am angry and i want my money back!",
            "i only got the app maybe 10 minutes ago but wow! i had some sort of malware on my phone that kept sending me to my settings and telling me to turn install on, if i did turn it on i got pop ups telling me to enter my bank details and if i tried to turn it off again i got sent to my camera, which made it almost impossible to close. anyway i got the app, did a scan and within 1 minute it found the issue and got rid of it. couldnt be happier!!!!"

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

But I really like the game... Can you make the map bigger? And make the red zone move slow",
            "Needs large improvement. The environment is good but the server can't handle more players. Sometimes it just picks me up from a match and drops me into another. Don't know why? Only the movement control works well, when the auto trigger is off you can't really play the game well. Additional voice conversation with other players will make the game more fun in Duo or Squad.",
            "Pleaze read, developer! I haven't played it but, it looks good and well made. But, some of the reviews said the graphics isn't really what it is in the pictures. So, I think developer, you should really fix that. And gameplay seems really good and fun, controls is fantastic, graphics uhhhh. Not sure about graphics so, imma edit this review later. You can get 4 Stars for effort! Oh, and! The reviews also said that the game lags like, LAG. So, fix that. Thank You for reading, developer.",
            "It's a good game I like it you want to fix offline play with bots It's a duplicate pubg.you want to fix voice conversation.it will be more fun i like very much this game. I didn't play Pugh or free fire. I saw the video of these games in youtube. I can't play these games. So I played this its my favourite battle Royale game thankyou",
            "Worst game I have ever played 1. It is extremely slow 2. Seriously the graphics is so bad 3. You cannot even match and enter immediately before you can play 1 game you need to match 5 times to play 4. The guns are totally useless seriously please fix these things else your game will be on the list of games that people do not even want to play and your effort will be wasted."

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Okay, I'm like level 22 now, it's a good game so props on that, only complaints I have are some of the islands aren't open yet, so idk how to fix the plane, I'm guessing that'll come with future updates, and for some reason there isn't a way to open the hangar on that science lab island, other than that, it's decent for a mobile game, plays pretty smoothly on my note 10+. good job guys",
            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting again😂🤣. It couldn't stop me from laughing.🤣😂🤣",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

Its not difficult and doesn't pester you with ads! It also doesn't ask you to rate it as much as other apps do! I recommend this app its simple to use! I would surely be using this for a while!",
            "SO GOOD!!! I never had any problems with removing a background. Anyone saying it's hard either doesn't know how to use or lying. Of course it's not like easy easy. There are times where u need to consentrate and need to be precise but it's not that hard. Good for youtubers or people that makes artworks. No more where am I even drawing? Or I'm not a professional person who has been training precision for years. Anyone can do it if u take time and watch tutorials",
            "Soooooo This app is really good! It works perfectly but... It's pretty hard to get rid of you extras left when you use the auto fill. I know there is a option to make it get rid of that but it's not the best. 5 is really bad becuase it can get rid of some of the picture. This app still is good and I still love it for editing. It is great with IBIS paint. Is great! :D",
            "SO GOOD!, its doesn't show as many ads as other apps!!! I suggest using this. and it doesn't SAY TO RATE IT ALL THE TIME ISNT THAT GREAT?. it's so easy to use to! it's so helpful with Youtubers or Instagram fanpages like me! I make themes and this helps so much I suggest using the magic eraser cause it gets all the spots you dont want!!! keep up the hood work byee!!!",
            "Ok, after I use this app for several times, I have found that this app is very helpful in my digital work. To create good photo for my product no matter how bad the background is. Thanks. But sometimes I found it hard to do clear the background to make it as good as it seen ."

            "Your game is so sluggish!!! I have a good internet speed but ms keeps on going up to 400. Come on! Do you have any plans to have it fixed? Your developer had made so much effort to make the CGI best but your server I think is the one the sucks. No wonder Mobile Legends has higher star rating than you folks. Try to have it fixed and y'all see the difference",
            "I really liked this game! It has many features and good heroes and skins. I loved this game. It needs some improvements here and there like in equipments for example you can remove the very base equipments like mana gem etc. And make a specific equipment for everything like only one for massive CD reduction ,So that it could be simpler for new players. I really loved this game they have tried very hard to make this game. Really deserves 5 stars for their hardship. Thank you and stay safe. ♥🌸",
            "Hey... I have a problem whit the game, every time I open the app (when I m the menu ) the game stop. I press the buttons , nothing happens. It happened before when the big update started , but now is worst. Is frustrating because it's happening every time when is a new update, but now nothing looks to work. The support system is been changed and is not very helpful for the gamer's ( the old one was better ). Thanks.",
            "The biggest problem with this game is the overwhelming number of clickbaits in the main menu. There is just too many things calling for attention, and all of them seems hungry for money to me. Moba gameplay is fine, not so different from AOV and MLBB if you don't consider passive level up as a strange thing. This game is reeking of China, it's not a bad thing but for a global audience this type of clickbait interface is just bad. Please improve your UI, it's just horrible."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "Its awesome, I found how many forms are there in yoga, even for beginners. Its nice to calculate that we are not that fit as we feel. We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

        "version": "Varies with device",
        "recentChanges": "We update the app regularly so that we can make it better for you. Get the latest version for all of the available Messenger features. This version includes several bug fixes and performance improvements. Thanks for using Messenger!",
        "comments": [
            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Crossy Road has became one of the games I use to pass time. Just because its a good game to pass time with. I played this for at least 1-2hours straight which is actually impressive! This game has some good graphics just because the characters, maps, and coins are easy to get. Some people don't think the presents are big enough because you have to wait a long time, but I don't think its to much or to big. Thats just me though. Its easy to get characters and maps you just have to put in effort!",
            "I lovwle this fun ,classic, and time killing game. This game is awesome, I would really recommend it! Defintly downlod it! (Sorry my spelling is a little off.) This game is the best time killer ever! I love all the characters you can collect, too! Please install this awesome game because the people who made sure knew, what they were doing! This is a 5 star review, because of those reasons! 😁",
            "Pretty fun but abysmal replay value, the only variation is difficulty, and themes from unlockable characters, and the only way to get characters is to get coins. Coins are very hard to get without ads (offered after every round) for 10 coins, so unless you are immortal and have infinite skill, you are going to spend more time watching voluntary ads if you want characters. (Plus the characters are randomly picked after you buy them with coins, and after a while repeats are common. 3/5.",
            "This game is really fun and addictive, you don't have to watch to much ads, it's challenging and can entertain you for hours! The only thing I found wrong with this game is that it can get boring after a lot of play, I wish they would make it possible to compete with players around the world, I mean you can compete with players but not on the same screen, like in the current game you can't play on the same screen as each other per say....",
            "It is a good game, it's very fun, but I have this problem that I almost ALWAYS get a duplicate when I win a prize. A few days after I first got this game I got a duplicate, and this has been going on ever since. Also, whenever I get a quest, I cannot what it is unless I turn the screen. Please move it to the bottom. Other than these things, it's a great game! I am addicted to it and play it all the time!"

            "I really like this game it's been 4 years that I'm still playing it, well the game changed so much and everything get even more better, more fantastic and nice, im still playing it and I really like it cus of the gameplay and everything, well it takes much to explain why I like it, but I suggest people for downloading it and u will love it.",
            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",
            "I really like this game,but sometimes i really always logging idk why im not full storage,i have 16GB and idk why this is happening in my cellphone but tnx qlot IGG games i still loving and playing this game but i dont like in this game i always loggong and quiting automatically,But i will always love this game but i will rate thia only 4 sorry IGG but i st8ll love your games..",
            "I love this game, but what the actual F. Lost connection? I spent 3 hours on a base design. 4 bars wifi. Perfect connection. All that base progress is gone. That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

            "This game is great, and I love to play it, but two things really get on my nerves, 1 definately more important than number 2. 1: Crashing. Every 5-8 minutes of playing the music will start to cut out (every single time it crashes) and then the game will close/crash. I have, so far, only seen 1 other review for crashes. 2: Slow pace. I don't like how slow the game progresses, it seems that it takes FOREVER to get the the next level, especially the more levels you climb, but that's just me.",
            "Edit: servers are undergoing maintenance, apparently. This is the first time this has happened for me without a notification popping up. Sigh. The game refuses to connect to the server despite me being on WiFi. It simply says \"unable to connect to server, check your connection\". I have checked, and my connection is fine. Please fix this. It's one thing to lose out on bonuses after activating boosters if I forget to log in, but another if I'm prevented from logging in altogether.",
            "Game crashes too easily nd issue is almost 50% reproducible. Suddenly, the application gets stuck and stops. Would like to have this fixed. Also, I have noticed sometimes, it gets blocked in a place for a few seconds probably 1 or 2 which always doesn't end up in an ANR but yes there is a big issue in this that the app crashes frequently",
            "This game is great i used to play it a while back and i recently started to get back into it, one main issue thats REALLY ticking me off is the nonstop crashing of the game. I don't remember this being this bad and as i read through the comments on the reports I'm not the only one please do your best to fix this issue",
            "This is a great game, I love supercell but there is a problem for the S9. ( well it happens to me) So I will be playing the game and collecting my crops, then I will put stuff on sale, then I would start to create things. But no matter what I do the game crashes every single time I play it, I know it's not my phone with supercell games because I have clash of clans and it doesn't crash at all. It's only hay day that crashes so supercell please fix this and I will give you a five star review!"

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

But YouTube didn't transfer my music, it just didn't work, which is frustrating. They don't care about people's satisfaction in listening to music, they only care about gaining money through subscriptions. Google Play Music was good, see that key word, was. YouTube Music doesn't need my money so I could listen to my music. It needs better function.",
            "It was working fine. I could happily listen to music offline. I honestly think that YouTube Music is really pointless since there's already a bunch of songs, covers, and instrumentals on YouTube itself. This is only getting a 1 star review and I have no actual regrets. Honestly who was dense enough to think of this idea, they should've known that no one would like this idea, it's such a fraud. If we now need internet to listen to music then that's really dumb. Have fun reading all the reviews",
            "Used the app a lot from the get go. Worked perfectly. I put all of my purchased/downloaded music on it for about 3-4 years. Then, the app was \"moved\".... along with all of my music. 3 years worth of music erased completely. I'm pretty disgusted.... so much, that I don't even want to give YouTube music a chance once I saw that my music wouldn't transfer. Not one song. All of my playlist titles are there... but no songs. I've tried multiple times and searched extensively. It's a complete RIP off.",
            "I have been using this app for years, even I changed phones. And I am happy to use it even when offline. The last time I used this app was yesterday before updating. Then I realized the app is discontinued and becomes Youtube Music. The wonderful memories and arranged music just gone. Well, it is nice while it lasted and it's time to move on. Goodbye.",
            "This app was perfect. Loved the format. Very user friendly. Love the fact that I could play music on my phone while phone was asleep or when using other apps. YouTube music sucks . I have to keep my phone awake while using. Also I can't easily play my personal music downloaded to my phone. Ill pay for Google music if I have to. How can I get it back?

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",

And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",

That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

My android cell phone had an update recently, the app icon has changed and e mail works fine from my phone but not my tablet. I've looked for an update but nothing so far. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail.",
            "Please make a simple way to delete in bulk. Ie, create a check-box to select multiple email at once. (Be sure to advise everyone that they'll have to change sync settings in all Google apps and devices. (Make that easy to do as well!) Or perhaps create a simpler way to check all settings that need apply. *Ease of access is key* It's annoying and is the reason I had to create 25 different Gmail accounts bc we don't have money to purchase any extra storage features. Please and thanks!",
            "Edit: the update got a new logo and now my emails take 30 minutes or more to send. Nice. Very nice. 🙄 This app is very behind compared to other apps. Where is the \"select all\" option? This app will only work with its limited features for those who dont have a lot of emails.For someone like me this isnt a possibility so this will no longer be my main emailing app.",
            "Just like all of Google's other products, this too does not work as expected. All of Google's products are failing lately. I have emails sitting there waiting to be read, but I rarely get a notification of them. And I am talking about the emails in my inbox, not the ads or subscription emails. That part of gmail actually still works quite well with those being separated into separate folders. I'm looking for apps that replace all of Google's apos... might even consider (gasp!) Apple's iPhone!",
            "Updates? Practically every other day but out of 15 emails I had today not one was in primary list. Every day I move them between primary; updates and promotions and still not one in the right place. You work on it every day but as far as I can see not one useful thing comes out of it. Oh yeah!! Beautiful new logo (how long did you work on it?) We really needed that?!?!"

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

            "This was one of my favorite games on the phone. I liked playing this on my phone all the time and loved on nom. The micro transactions are a little annoying, but can be helpful. The ads make the game nearly unplayable. And the subscription to eliminate the ads is a complete money grab. Iknow companies have to make money, but this is insane.",
            "Ads pop up after every game and retry. The game is better than it used to be with tips and hints. Or maybe I just like to cheat! Addictive and fun. Om Nom is cute when he's eating and when he's disappointed you've lost his candy. I really wish I didn't have to go through all those ads to play. Half the time I'm on the app is spent waiting for the ads to play through. That's why it's free",
            "THE ADS IS TOOOOOOOO MUCCCHHHH. THE PURPOSE OF THE GAME IS TO HAVE FUN AND ENJOY BUT IT BECAME ANNOYING BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH ADS. HOPE THAT THE CREATOR WILL NOTICE THIS. IT USED TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME,DOWNLOADED IT AGAIN SO MY SON CAN PLAY BUT REFUSED AFTER 2 LEVELS BEACAUSE OF THE ADS.",
            "It was so good and if you're just bored you can play this game but also it doesn't take Wi-Fi LOL and so if you're like if you like puzzles but not too much you can do this it's amazing so you should really get it it's for adults kids teens and tweens",
            "I'm very much sad to give you 2 stars for this amazing game, the ads literally make the game unplayable. I seriously wish it wasn't like this"

Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\r\n\r\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\r\n\r\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\r\n\r\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\r\n\r\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes.

Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\r\n\r\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.\r\n\r\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\r\n\r\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\r\n\r\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\r\n\r\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\r\n\r\n*Data charges may apply.

Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>WHY USE WHATSAPP:<br><br>• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone&#39;s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don&#39;t have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.<br><br>• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they&#39;re in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone&#39;s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan&#39;s voice minutes.

Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*<br><br>• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone&#39;s existing address book.<br><br>• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you&#39;re always logged in so you don&#39;t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you&#39;re logged in or logged out.<br><br>• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there&#39;s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.<br><br>• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.<br><br>• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!<br><br>*Data charges may apply.

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I'll start off with the pros then get to the cons. So first off, the games controls are easy and I love the style of it all. It's very good for killing time. Sadly, it can glitch sometimes and it is way to difficult. I have read other reviews and lots of people have this problem. Also, too many ads. There is an ad for every level and if you die, even if you don't choose to revive by watching an ad, you have to watch one. Also you never get any revives so you are forced to watch an ad to revive.",
            "This game is overall good but to many ads. I understand that u are getting paid for the ads and what not but there is to many.Therefore i play Rise Up offline when i am in the car or just bored outside of home. It is a rlly hard game but is brilliant for getting rid of bordem. Keep it up Rise Up but remove most ads pls. Yours Faithfully, chocolatesarefood",
            "I give you 5 stars because. I played a lot's of games means nearly 2 thousands game and this game is one of best game in my life. Yes, there are some missing things or some bugs. I think if we observe the game Defrently like it's music, it's theme, it will inspire us, this game will motivate us. And thing, if we play this game form our heart with Egnoring some bugs then this game will teach us how to survive in the world. It's my opinion. AND SORRY FOR MY POOR ENGLISH. 🙂🙂",
            "Enjoyable game to play, but there are some seriously savage bugs. Given that I write console games for a living, I know about bugs, but these surely couldn't have gone unnoticed? Shouldn't have been released in this state as it doesn't do a lot for your credibility. Also, the fact you run an advert every other play through, well, that just craps all over the general experience. Pity, this could have been a great game if it wasn't for the poor advert decisions and dubious execution.",
            "5 stars! Absolutely 5 stars! This game is so addictive i even have to take a break every day because of it, and im not mad at all! This game is very good to play when you are bored, and ads dont pop up as much as they do in other games. Totally amazing! I'd recommend this game to kids who are bored on the holidays or even the weekend!"

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "This is good for videos, but the audio not so much. When you record videos it doesn't record just the noises from whatever happens on your phone, it records background noise too. You can't even edit out the background noise because the options are very limited in the editing department. Videos will look like ASMR. It makes an otherwise high quality video into a close mic mess. I'm sure you can add a remover? And don't just make it for premium users, that would just be scummy.",
            "Great app. Gives option to remove ads for free, but tells you that it hurts them. Because of this I opted to keep ads, but that is a really nice touch. Something I'd like to see is the option to not have the camera overlay on the screen, but be able to have 2 output files, one from the camera, and one from the screen recording session. Overall, a great experience and probably the best all round screen recorder, even among the paid ones.",
            "This is the best screen recorder app ever!!!! Everything is going well,and i dont have any problem since using this app.and the most fabulous thing is we can put our face while recording!!!really like it and 5 star for such a good app!thanks for doing a great job.i recommend this to anyone who need a screen recorder app because this is the best! 👍",
            "It's a great app for recording, and videos dont really go corrupt that much! The only reason they go corrupt is, if you dont have enough space on your device. The only problem is, that if I try to live stream, it will just load, and load, and load! And nothing happens! Idk if it's the app or my device but, yeah that happens. If you fi this problem, that would be great!",
            "OMG!!! I was looking for another Screen recorder after my old screen recorder betrayed me. This works perfectly well.... My only issue the internal sound recording. It works but it picks up the noise in the background instantly. Like if I just move my hand from my speaker or move my phone a little bit , it picks up that sounds in an instant and amplifies it in the recorded video. I do not want that. Otherwise great app."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely.

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "By far the worst checkers game I have seen in my life. The AI is programmed so that you cannot possibly win. They will either move back and forth until the get what they want or the game ends in a draw. The fact that the creators think this is even somewhat fair is ridiculous and absurd. I could outnumber the AI 2 to 1, and they just go to the corner, move back and forth about 10 times, and it's automatically a draw. Also, an ad plays every time you exit or restart. Such an awful game/cash grab.",
            "I really loved playing checkers.. It's really enjoyable 😍 There is no problem if u ask me, just the themes take much time to load.. Otherwise this is very nice game. Great features.. And also, This is my favourite game😄.. I've installed th both: Chess nd Checkers.. Coz I love playing these witty games. Loved dis app.. Thank you so much🙂.. For launching this app😁",
            "This is really cool. In addition to standard American checkers, there are options to play on boards with different layouts from around the world. The Turkish board and rules is especially intriguing.",
            "Great. But maybe it'd be better if you could see the score as you play, plus, what if you didn't need to skip to move the checker but you just slide it through instead, i believe it'd be more pleasurable. The speed is too slow too",
            "I'm enjoying learning how the rest of the world plays checkers. I had no idea how wide spread. & so many different rules nuances inspite of the basic similarities. I'm really learning something & loving it!😉"

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "This would be a higher rating, except that there is no more save button. When I tried to save my finished page, it saved from only halfway done. Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ❣️ the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

Wish more games would have this kind of setup. The developer did a wonderful job. The information is accurate and allows for easy access to multipliers and multiple maps. Always adds to my Ark experience in the best way possible.",
            "My friend used this app and now I can understand his gibberish by using this. It's got alot of good info in here ARK won't readily tell you and it sure changed how I played. Some of those Dinos I ignored...amazing! It also includes recipes which I really needed. My only complaint is how the mobile users info gets thrown in, making some info inconsistent.",
            "I personally love ark, and this app is a MUST HAVE for all survivors. Whether you play for fun, like me, or competitively, or even to see how much you're pc/console can handle, this app is for you, as it has kibble recipes, taming calculators, level spread calculators, and an extremely funny and helpful community",
            "it's very helpful in taming dino but can you also add some more features like for hunting dino how much ammo you will need like you show for taming and all the recipies for not only kibble but others also like guns and more and also can you show engrams which can unlock at which level because in ark mobile you can only see engrams which are going to unlock and rather than that the app is best and op keep it up",
            "I'm still learning new things every day on Ark, this ap has made life so much easier. the calculations will need to be adjusted (go to settings) to the server you play on. It calculates tame levels, tame knock out requirements, recipies, everything you'd need to know about what ever tame your hunting for. It also has a comment helping section, real players can comment on helpful tips about how they knocked out that tame."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. 🧚🌼👼👼. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too.

            "Perfect app. It has some really cool team builds and shows what items are best (recommended) for each champion. I also love how you can enable a mode called \"bubble\" which is an overlay popup displaying in-game' without lagging out the actual game itself. After a while, you start getting used to what champ works best with each other and eventually start creating your own teams. Its really ideal for any newcomer. Edit** +2 Stars again. Team Composition is back working. :)",
            "Thanks for always being so responsive and constantly improving the app! is there a possibility for the overlay to be able to detect the champs that you have on the board, and for the team suggestion to then show you the suggested comps as an overlay option? also, for the team suggestion option, could the teams be in order of tier please? right now it seems to be shown in random order which makes it slightly more frustrating to use. Thanks for reading!",
            "Great for mobile when playing tft. Has helped me consistently rank up and keep up with current builds.",
            "The only thing atm I dislike is how annoying the items page is. If I have 1 item and looking for something to build with it, like in the carousel round, I don't have time to click each possible item to find something. Check out TFT wiki's item page for an ex of a straightforward and easy-to-use items page for references. I like the customizable options in yours but I hate how you can't tap to remove items, its too clunky and not user friendly"

(Android 9+)<br>Wake-up tracker and cut-off now works for apps in Island and compatible with Android 10.<br>App analyzer is improved with foreground service detection and other minor tweaks.<br>Fixed &quot;Hibernate and Sleep&quot; shortcut when only apps in Island are pending.",

            "I've been using this since my Oppo A37 (very old model) until now with my Oppo Reno 4. And this works very great on both! It stops my battery draining very fast like normally it decreases every minute but ever since I am using this app, my battery life can continue for another 2 hours. I can't live without this. Please don't try to update this like there were so many changes, I like it to be this simple already. Thank you!!!!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews but I felt that I should with this one. I have a Galaxy s8 plus. It's an awesome phone except for the battery, especially after the last update. I took a chance and downloaded Greenify and noticed a difference the first day. My battery definitely lasts MUCH longer and the bonus is there's no ANNOYING ADS! Seems to be a great app so far.",
            "This app called greenfy.apk, please this app helps with hybernating and closing all background apps running at your background and draining your battery live span. It works perfectly on both rooted and non-rooted devices. It will show you all the system and non system apps running currently and the time you started running those up and stiil counting!!! Then you can either choose to hybernate it or let it run so, I think this app is perfect for those using iPhone and we the Android lover",
            "I've always used this app, no matter what device I use. Now I'm using RealMe 5 Pro (not rooted), and I decided to finally purchase the donate version, and it somehow doesn't work :/ when it force closes an app, the next app's 'Force Close' option is grayed out, so in the end, I have to force close each one individually. I really love this app, and I'm hoping for a fix soon.",
            "I have been using Greenify for years now and it has saved me so many times when I am out and about by saving battery for me. One thing to note is that it is not for those who don't know what they are doing. With that said, Greenify should include more instructions and short explanations(such as the meaning of backgroud-free). A lot of bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works and don't know it's limitations."

        "description": "How annoying it is when your friends delete their messages before you can see them?\r\nThe curiosity takes over. You just found the solution: WAMR!\r\n\r\nWAMR is the utility you were looking for. With one tool you are able to recover text messages and also any media attachment (pictures, videos, voice notes, audio, animated gifs and stickers)!\r\nNow you can also download Statuses! All with one app!\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nMessages are encrypted on your device so WAMR can't access them directly.\r\nThe only solution available is to read them from the notifications that you receive and create a message backup based on your notification history.\r\nWhen WAMR will detect that a message as been deleted, it will immediately show you a notification!\r\n\r\nMEDIA MESSAGES\r\nWAMR will also try to save any media attached to the message and if the sender deletes it, you will receive a notification.\r\nThe following media types can be recovered: pictures, videos, animated gifs, audio, voice notes, documents, stickers.\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS\r\nPlease be aware that it doesn't exist an official and supported way to recover deleted messages. This is a workaround and may encounter limitations caused by the selected messaging app or even the Android OS:\r\n1) Text messages are recovered by your notifications, therefore, if you have put a chat on silence, or if you are currently watching a message on the messaging app before it's deleted you will not receive a notification so WAMR can't save it! This also obviously means that is impossible to recover notifications/messages before you downloaded this app (so download it quickly!).\r\n\r\n2) If messages aren't being saved, it may be caused by Android killing WAMR. Please remove WAMR from all battery optimization services!\r\n\r\n3) WAMR can't save files if they aren't completely downloaded! So if you are offline or you have an unstable connection, or in general if the sender deletes the message containing a media before the messaging app downloads it, WAMR can't do anything to save it.\r\n\r\n4) If you aren't using a WiFi connection, some media may not be automatically downloaded by your messaging app because of your settings. You can change this behavior in Messaging app > Settings > Data and storage usage and increase your chances.\r\n\r\nOther limitations may be caused by your Android version, or your system language (in particular if it is right-to-left).

Often doesn't record audio, images, videos and statuses, even if notifications are on and downloading media is fully on(wi-fi and mobile data). In play market, there's only one app that records (supposed to record and save) all deleted messages, and that's WAMR.(4 stars) 10/16/2020: It can't store data on sd card...(2 stars)",
            "Everything works fab !!! The only thing which needs to be fixed is : 1. Why does it recover the media which i deleted myself from gallery. 2. It just shows the statuses which i opened rather than showing all the statuses. 3. Lastly in the status section categorize it as photos & videos. Plz fix this, it will surely rock the app...",
            "Well the app is great. But sometimes it fails to recover media even when it is fully downloaded. And now it doesn't work because I moved the contents of WhatsApp to SD card. Please fix this error. Make it so that it can still show media when it is being downloaded to SD. Otherwise it is awesome.",
            "It should be able to capture those messages and media which I haven't seen or opened. Suppose I miss a message while I am sleeping, I should be able to get those messages even when the sender has deleted it.. Otherwise it works relly perfect. Thank you for all your hard work.",
            "It is very useful in the beginning but gradullay it cannot work properly the name we cannot saved in our contact he/she sent a message to whatsapp or any other medias if they delete the message we cannot see that I cannot get the notification i enable the notification i cant get it But sometimes it is very useful app to me I suggest to everyone in this app Thankyou"

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

            "Been using it for a long time, but then I noticed the battery drain when I got my redmi note 9 pro. Compared poco and Nova, both without any widgets, and Nova had more battery consumption. For now I'll stick to poco. Maybe when I get a new phone (or install a custom ROM) then I'm trying Nova again 😁",
            "Works like it was preinstalled smooth lots of features easy to use you would think it came with your phone if tried over 5 or more apps like me this is the last one excellent choice. 👍🏾",
            "By far one of the best launcher out there. Definitely worth a try.",
            "Used to be great but as my devices have gotten bigger I've noticed that the inability to place folder icons at the bottom of the folder is really becoming an issue, especially if using one hand. Folders are becoming useless in that regard, it's easier just to create another home screen and do your best to organize.",
            "The only flaws I see with Nova and Nova Prime are as follows: I found it hard to set up the backup and restore directories. I always feel I can't to double-check the destination. I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."
