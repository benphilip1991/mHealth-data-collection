This adds up naturally to the fact that the user has an objective idea of his/her status with respect to a rheumatic condition and its evolution over time, which in itself is a benefit. The app thus really allows to follow the \"treat-to-target\" trend.

There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints — especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths — especially in the morning — help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n✅ arthritis ✅\r\n✅ rheumatoid arthritis ✅\r\n✅ arthritis in hands ✅\r\n✅ arthritis pain relief ✅",

This article is dedicated to discussing about the natural remedies for joint pain and hence I will stick to the point.\r\n\r\nConventionally arthritis has been managed with analgesics called as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatories (NSAIDs). NSAIDs cause dangerous side effects like gastric ulceration and they also increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Thus both patients and their doctors are not averse to looking at Mother Nature to help ease the joint pain in arthritis. While natural and herbal remedies are generally free from side effects and are reasonably effective they might interfere with other prescription medications. It is therefore prudent on the part of the patient to check with their doctors first before starting these medications.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole range of natural remedies for joint pain and it would be practically impossible to go through all of them but I will list the ones that are most effective with reasonable scientific backing to their use.\r\n\r\nGlucosamine and Chondroitin: Perhaps no other natural remedy have been as extensively studied as these two. Both Glucosamine and Chondroitin are found naturally occurring in the joints and with wear and tear of the joints these reduce dramatically in an arthritic joint. It is thus appropriate that there should be some relief from joint pains when one substitutes these ingredients in the joint.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids have a wide range of beneficial effects in the human body. Derived from fish oils they reduce inflammation and pain of many chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nBromelain: Derived from the Papaya fruit, Bromelain has shown good anti-inflammatory effect and is an analgesic too.\r\n\r\nMethylSulfonylMethane: MSM occurs naturally in plants and animals and preliminary studies have shown promise as a good analgesic in arthritis.\r\nDevil's claw and Cat's claw: Both these herbs have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and have been used for centuries for their effectiveness not only in arthritis but also in other ailments.\r\n\r\nBoswellia (Indian Frankincense): Regular use of Boswellia improves blood flow to the joints thus resulting in a well-nourished and viable joint tissue.

        "description": "I am assuming that most of the readers of this article are aware of the basics of arthritis and I am not going into finer details of the disease per se here. This article is dedicated to discussing about the natural remedies for joint pain and hence I will stick to the point.\r\n\r\nConventionally arthritis has been managed with analgesics called as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatories (NSAIDs). NSAIDs cause dangerous side effects like gastric ulceration and they also increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Thus both patients and their doctors are not averse to looking at Mother Nature to help ease the joint pain in arthritis. While natural and herbal remedies are generally free from side effects and are reasonably effective they might interfere with other prescription medications. It is therefore prudent on the part of the patient to check with their doctors first before starting these medications.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole range of natural remedies for joint pain and it would be practically impossible to go through all of them but I will list the ones that are most effective with reasonable scientific backing to their use.\r\n\r\nGlucosamine and Chondroitin: Perhaps no other natural remedy have been as extensively studied as these two. Both Glucosamine and Chondroitin are found naturally occurring in the joints and with wear and tear of the joints these reduce dramatically in an arthritic joint. It is thus appropriate that there should be some relief from joint pains when one substitutes these ingredients in the joint.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids have a wide range of beneficial effects in the human body. Derived from fish oils they reduce inflammation and pain of many chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nBromelain: Derived from the Papaya fruit, Bromelain has shown good anti-inflammatory effect and is an analgesic too.\r\n\r\nMethylSulfonylMethane: MSM occurs naturally in plants and animals and preliminary studies have shown promise as a good analgesic in arthritis.\r\nDevil's claw and Cat's claw: Both these herbs have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and have been used for centuries for their effectiveness not only in arthritis but also in other ailments.\r\n\r\nBoswellia (Indian Frankincense): Regular use of Boswellia improves blood flow to the joints thus resulting in a well-nourished and viable joint tissue. Boswellia has been used in traditional Ayurveda since times immemorial.",

        "title": "HOW TO CURE JOINT PAIN",
        "description": "Joints form the connections between bones. They provide support and help you move. Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nMany different conditions can lead to painful joints, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, gout, strains, sprains, and other injuries. Joint pain is extremely common. In one national survey, about one-third of adults reported having joint pain within the past 30 days. Knee pain was the most common complaint, followed by shoulder and hip pain, but joint pain can affect any part of your body, from your ankles and feet to your shoulders and hands. As you get older, painful joints become increasingly more common.\r\n\r\nJoint pain can range from mildly irritating to debilitating.

        "description": "Research has shown a link between how you see your body and your feeling of pain. Evidence from phantom limb pain and mirror therapy show how illusions can reduce Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis pain. \r\n\r\nNottingham uses your smartphone and its camera to provide the illusion of your hand and fingers either stretching or compressing. This triggers pain-relief pathways in the brain, reducing your feeling of pain and potentially even increasing your range of motion.\r\n\r\nNottingham is a great supplemental therapy for Arthritis management. Try it today for drug-free pain relief with no side-effects!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n How to use Nottingham Therapy:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Nottingham app and select either Hand or Foot therapy\r\n2. Customize your Stretch or Compress therapy by selecting your desired duration and stretch or compression amount.\r\n3. *Optional: Place your mobile device on the Nottingham stand\r\n4. If you selected Hand therapy, take a photo of the back and palm of your hand.\r\n5. Place your hand or foot under the camera and tap to focus.\r\n6. Relax and focus on your hand or foot as it stretches and compresses\r\n\r\n*Nottingham is best used with its stand. The stand allows for hand-free stabilization of your mobile device, allowing you to focus completely on the therapy. \r\nYou can purchase the stand in the app by clicking the Options tab on the Main Menu.",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",

        "description": "Think you can’t stop that arthritis pain? Great news! You can act now. Get 10 super easy and effective arthritis pain relief tips from arthritis experts and make your life with arthritis a little easier now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect your joints. Don’t keep your joints in the same position for a prolonged period of time. Balance your rest and work throughout the day. Use the strongest joints available for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStretch it. Stretching should be part of every arthritis patient’s daily routine. A good stretch helps prevent injuries by warming up muscles and tendons which are more limber and less likely to tear. Spend at least 10 minutes each day stretching, and work each major muscle group. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCool it down. Stop physical activity. Rest in a cool/shaded environment. Spray with a mist of cool water or wrap an ice pack or cold compress in a towel and apply it to reduce arthritis pain and swelling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet moving. Exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness and increases flexibility and muscle strength. It can also help with weight control, stress management, and make you feel better overall. The Arthritis Foundation also offers water exercise and other classes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a massage. Massage therapy can relieve your pain, soothe stiff sore muscles, reduce inflammation and swelling. Make sure you use oil or cream on your fingers to make it mroe gentle. Work the area for five to ten minutes a day if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your weight in balance. Being overweight, even just moderately, impacts weightbearing joints and can increase the pain of arthritis. Studies have indicated that losing extra weight lowers the risk for developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Losing weight can help slow the progression of arthritis too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, swelling for more than 1 weeks, you should consider seeing your doctor and getting a diagnosis. Remember that there are more than 100 types of arthritis. It is important to get the specific diagnosis for the type of arthritis you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake your medication the right way. Don’t stop taking your medication just because you feel it is not working. Check with your doctor first. You need to understand that it may take several days to several months for a medication to become effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook out for new options. Recently FDA has approved some new drugs for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis diseases. If feel that the current medication doesn’t work well, check with your doctor about possible new options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep educating yourself. It is important to learn something new about arthritis. Find some good websites online and subscribe to their newsletter if they have it. Join one of two active online arthritis communities like forums or bulletin board. Never hesitate to see your doctors and ask questions.",

Stretching should be part of every arthritis patient’s daily routine. A good stretch helps prevent injuries by warming up muscles and tendons which are more limber and less likely to tear. Spend at least 10 minutes each day stretching, and work each major muscle group. <br><br><br><br>Cool it down. Stop physical activity. Rest in a cool/shaded environment. Spray with a mist of cool water or wrap an ice pack or cold compress in a towel and apply it to reduce arthritis pain and swelling. <br><br><br><br>Get moving. Exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness and increases flexibility and muscle strength. It can also help with weight control, stress management, and make you feel better overall. The Arthritis Foundation also offers water exercise and other classes. <br><br><br><br>Get a massage. Massage therapy can relieve your pain, soothe stiff sore muscles, reduce inflammation and swelling. Make sure you use oil or cream on your fingers to make it mroe gentle. Work the area for five to ten minutes a day if possible.<br><br><br><br>Keep your weight in balance. Being overweight, even just moderately, impacts weightbearing joints and can increase the pain of arthritis. Studies have indicated that losing extra weight lowers the risk for developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Losing weight can help slow the progression of arthritis too.<br><br><br><br>Get a diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, swelling for more than 1 weeks, you should consider seeing your doctor and getting a diagnosis. Remember that there are more than 100 types of arthritis. It is important to get the specific diagnosis for the type of arthritis you have.<br><br><br><br>Take your medication the right way. Don’t stop taking your medication just because you feel it is not working. Check with your doctor first. You need to understand that it may take several days to several months for a medication to become effective.<br><br><br><br>Look out for new options. Recently FDA has approved some new drugs for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis diseases. If feel that the current medication doesn’t work well, check with your doctor about possible new options.<br><br><br><br>Keep educating yourself. It is important to learn something new about arthritis. Find some good websites online and subscribe to their newsletter if they have it.

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

        "description": " Reasons for knee pain \r\n\r\nIf you’re not dealing with a specific injury—say, a torn ACL—sorting out knee pain can seem complicated. The knee is composed of two joints: the tibiofemoral joint, between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), and the patellofemoral joint, between the femur and patella (knee cap). Each is an anchor point for multiple tendons, fascia, and other structures, including the IT band. If you have bad biomechanics, typically caused by a muscle imbalance, especially weak glutes, repetitive movement can irritate structures in the knee and lead to what is broadly known as anterior knee pain—a catchall category for general pain in the front of the knee.  \r\nThe stabilizer muscles for the knee, counterintuitively, are in the hips. When those muscles are weak or imbalanced, they can’t keep your knee properly aligned. “If you’re not able to control the position of your leg as your foot makes contact with the ground, pedal, or rock, it can result in increased stress to the structures of the knee. To further complicate the issue, once the pain signals your brain that there’s a problem, this can lead to further compensations in response to the irritation, which can shut off key muscles and tighten up other structures.\r\n\r\n Explanation of all the muscles that need to be strengthened and why: \r\n\r\n\r\nQuadriceps.\r\n\r\nThey cover the front of the thigh, cross the kneecap and form a tendon known as the patellar tendon. The quadriceps muscles allow you to extend or straiten the knee. If there is a weakness or tightness in the quadriceps you will get pain and stress in the joint as you go upstairs or get up from a chair.\r\n\r\nHip adductor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Adductors allow you to adduct your leg or bring it to the midline of the body. They help to stabilise the hip joint and help maintain the body in a stationary position.\r\n\r\nHip flexor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Flexor muscles allow you to flex your hip. Hip Flexor muscles come from the spine and the pelvis and attach to the upper thigh bone. If the hip flexors are tight or weak they can pull the thigh out of its proper alignment. This in turn pulls the kneecap out of its groove causing knee pain.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles allow you to bend the knee and also extend your hip. Most importantly strong hamstring muscles will help you protect a very important ligament called the ACL.\r\n\r\nGastrocnemius muscle.\r\n\r\nPeople with weak calf muscles often complain of pain in the front of the knee around the patellar tendon area.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius allows you to perform activities including hip abduction and hip external rotation. When you’re walking you’re only on one foot at any given time. The Gluteus medius help you to stabilise your pelvis. If it’s weak you get a drop in your hip and that causes stress on the knee.\r\n\r\nGluteus maximus.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to extend your hip and externally rotate your hip. If the Gluteus maximus muscles are weak other muscles in the back of the leg tend to take over and you end up with overly active hamstrings and tight hamstrings lead to knee pain.",

Arthritis is the most usual reason for joint pains though. Many people who experience this kind of pain for the first time tend to blame aging and think they are already suffering from arthritis. This may be true to some, but definitely not to everyone.\r\n\r\nMany times in life, body pains as such may inevitably affect our living lifestyle and even cause inconvenience to our lives, as moving of joints is almost indispensable.\r\n\r\nBasically the causes of joint pain can be triggered by various injuries and conditions besides aging. It may be a result of sports injury, excessive straining due to the overuse of joints, or even be one of the symptoms for arthritis. Hence it is important to understand your body well and detect the symptoms early as an average person may not be able tell if it's the joints or a torn tendon.\r\n\r\nHere in this app are a few remedies which can give you a better quality of life and may help to eliminate the consumption of painkillers as medications commonly prescribed for joint pain are usually pain killers and anti inflammatories!",

            "App asks you to fill in all your conditions/meds upon install. I filled out 7 meds including dosages/formats. Waste of time. Once the app opened I realize that the meds are only relevant in answer to the question \"what medication did you take for your pain?\" but none of mine are painkillers, they're all taken on a schedule. Also, there's no distinction between pain from differing conditions for entries. e.g. condition 1 = pain 4, would be nice to do",

I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",
            "I was so excited about this app. I finally could do exercises for my specific issues. However the plan never works. My screen goes black right after the welcome video. I'm so disappointed.",

        "description": "MyTherapy is an ad-free, award-winning pill reminder and medication tracker. But MyTherapy is more than a free medication reminder: Combining a pill tracker, mood tracker and a health journal, e.g. with a weight tracker, this medication reminder app allows you and your doctor to put your treatment’s success into perspective. ⏰ 💊🔔\r\n\r\n💊Key Features \r\n• Pill reminder app for all medications\r\n• Pill tracker with logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes\r\n• Support for wide range of dosing schemes within medication reminder\r\n• Track your tablets, dose, measurements, activities as a comprehensive health journal\r\n• Family sharing\r\n• Share your printable health journal with your doctor\r\n• Personalized tips for your treatment\r\n• Wide range of measurements for all conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, hypertension, multiple sclerosis) e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels\r\n\r\n⏰Comprehensive meds reminder \r\nWe designed a medicine reminder app that puts all your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (tablet, pill, inhalation, …) frequency, and even refill reminders. And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications.

        "descriptionHTML": "MyTherapy is an ad-free, award-winning pill reminder and medication tracker. But MyTherapy is more than a free medication reminder: Combining a pill tracker, mood tracker and a health journal, e.g. with a weight tracker, this medication reminder app allows you and your doctor to put your treatment’s success into perspective. ⏰ 💊🔔<br><br>💊<b>Key Features </b><br>• Pill reminder app for all medications<br>• Pill tracker with logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes<br>• Support for wide range of dosing schemes within medication reminder<br>• Track your tablets, dose, measurements, activities as a comprehensive health journal<br>• Family sharing<br>• Share your printable health journal with your doctor<br>• Personalized tips for your treatment<br>• Wide range of measurements for all conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, hypertension, multiple sclerosis) e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels<br><br>⏰<b>Comprehensive meds reminder </b><br>We designed a medicine reminder app that puts all your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (tablet, pill, inhalation, …) frequency, and even refill reminders.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "I like the different levels you can choose from. I have rheumatoid arthritis and some days I need beginner and some days I need intermediate. I also like that there is time to get a into a new pose before the timer starts so I don't have to rush getting my joints to cooperate.",
            "Smashing little app. Most say beginners then give a crazy routine to do. This is perfect for those who like me have been out of shape for whatever reason and need to take things at an easier pace. Its not too easy. Just the right pace to get you ready for more adventurous poses. Thank you.",
            "From long we were looking for an excercise/yoga app. We are very happy the way it has been designed. It's very user friendly and does what exactly a yoga app is supposed to do. It's been around one and half month and already it has made a place in our daily routine. Kudos to team. Hoping to see more options in android version too as many are available in iOS version.",
            "I like this app and it's simple enough to use in my opinion but I'd say the instructor should be larger so it's easier to see the pose/position as being demonstrated. Other than that I still recommend it.",
            "I would like the video to be able to go landscape on my phone and it didn't. I tried to turn it off to start another lesson and it kept playing. Have to uninstall it to stop it. Frustrating. But was enjoying the concept."

I would expect more positive messages like \"it's okay, yo can try again tomorrow\". Apart from that, I think the app is fairly good especially considering it's free. One issue I have is that I cannot turn off the app music to switch, for example, to spotify. The background music from the app is very repetitive and I'd love to switch to one of my playlists. All in all, great app.",
            "This app is fairly good. However \"a beautiful body has never been easy\" quote after push exit from an exercise? Completely misleading, negative, and not body positive at all. I am confident, and have a fairly strong and lean figure, but this is just so offensive. No one needs to second guess if there body is beautiful while realizing they dont have time to workout. They dont need to ask themselves if skipping a workout will make them less attractive. This is toxic. Correct it immediately",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "It is a great app and there are recipes for the average person so you DO NOT have to go to the health food market to get a ton of specialty items and spend an arm and a leg. You use real fruits and veggies that you get at your local market or veggie stand. Thank you an app for the average person.",
            "These smoothies are exactly what the title says, Healthy, Quick and Easy, but the author is missing one key description ... delicious! Finding a combination of ingredients that all my kids like is tough, but I've found these recipes to be both Kid and adult-approved. I needed some new quick recipes and this app delivered.",
            "This app is a real treasury of smoothie ideas ranging from smoothies for sports to smoothies for kids. In a big family, where everyone is always busy, we ended up eating the same standard food for days. Now, a glass of healthy fresh smoothie out of a blender with a few pieces of ice is a bliss making happy everyone. My wife is asking me who taught me such a variety of smoothie ideas. But it's my little secret. (Wink-wink) 🤫😜😘🙃 Excellent collection, easy to use, best experience! ❤",
            "This is a great app. I have been trying the smoothies one by one and all of them have been great. My vita mix is getting a work out because I am using it nearly every day. The app is easy to read end it is grouped so that you can pick the type of smoothie do you want to make",
            "I have been delighted with this smoothie recipe app and is working my way through large parts of the app. What makes it so good for me is that the recipes are easy to source, the instructions are clear and it contains largely fruit smoothies which is what I was seeking."

        "description": "La Sociedad Española de Reumatología (SER) y la Sociedad Española de Medicina de Familia y Comunitaria (SEMFYC) han desarrollado conjuntamente una guía sobre las  enfermedades autoinmunes sistémicas para facilitar la derivación al reumatólogo por parte del médico de atención primaria, con el objetivo de  detectar y remitir las posibles sospechas de este tipo de afecciones.\r\n\r\nEsta iniciativa está coordinada por la Dra. Ana Urruticoechea Arana, reumatóloga; y por el Dr. Fernando León Vázquez, médico de familia. Y en el comité editorial participan los doctores Iñigo Rúa-Figueroa, José Luis Andréu, Alejandro Olivé,  Mercedes Freire y Vicente Giner.\r\n\r\nEl objetivo principal del proyecto es desarrollar una guía de derivación que ayudará al médico de atención primaria en la toma de decisiones ante la sospecha clínica de una EAS, facilitando su reconocimiento y su derivación al reumatólogo en su caso.\r\n\r\nEl objetivos secundario es sensibilizar a los médicos de familia de la existencia de estas patologías menos frecuentes, mejorar la calidad de las derivaciones, disminuir los tiempos de espera y coordinar los dos niveles asistenciales en relación con estas patologías.\r\n\r\nPor su complejidad, la afectación multi-sistémica y baja frecuencia, el manejo de las enfermedades autoinmunes sistémicas es un formidable reto al que se enfrenta el médico en su práctica clínica. Su abordaje requiere aprendizaje específico durante el periodo formativo, experiencia y una puesta al día constante. Aunque estas patologías se consideran enfermedades poco frecuentes, en conjunto se pueden considerar no excepcionales. “De hecho, estas enfermedades afectan a cientos de miles de pacientes en España y el médico de atención primaria puede enfrentarse durante su ejercicio a múltiples casos, al menos, al inicio de la enfermedad y colaborar con los especialistas en su seguimiento. En este sentido, deberá por tanto aprender a reconocerlas y mejorar sus competencias básicas en el manejo de este grupo de procesos”\r\n\r\nRealizado por un grupo de expertos de las dos sociedades científicas: Sociedad Española de Medicina Familiar y Comunitaria (SEMFYC) y Sociedad Española de Reumatología (SER). Se ha diseñado un índice de síntomas y signos guía a partir de cada uno de los cuáles se ha desarrollado consensuadamente un algoritmo de toma de decisiones que conducen a una lista de posibles diagnósticos y una propuesta de derivación. Los panelistas  han seleccionado diferentes signos y síntomas sospechosos de EAS. Cada algoritmo lo ha realizado una pareja formada por un especialista de reumatología y otro de medicina familiar y comunitaria, pertenecientes a la SER y SEMFYC, respectivamente. \r\n\r\nSe han diseñado 22 algoritmos homogeneizados con síntomas y síndromes ordenados por órganos y aparatos:\r\n\r\n- Cutáneos: Exantema, fotosensibilidad, púrpura, eritema nodoso y livedo reticularis.\r\n\r\n- Mucosos: Aftas orales y genitales, sinusitis crónica, xerostomía y parotidomegalia.\r\n\r\n- Vasculares: Fenómeno de Raynaud, trombosis venosa recurrente e isquemia arterial.\r\n\r\n- Oculares: Uveítis, ojo seco y epiescleritis.\r\n\r\n- Neurológicos: Cefalea/arteritis de la temporal.\r\n\r\n- Abortos recurrentes.\r\n\r\n- Músculoesqueléticos: Artritis agudas, artritis crónicas, artromialgias y dolor crónico.\r\n\r\n- Síntomas generales: Pérdida de peso y fiebre.\r\n\r\n- Alteraciones analíticas: Reactantes de fase (VSG y PCR),  factor reumatoide, ANAs y la creatinfosfokinasa.\r\n\r\nLes presentamos la GUÍA DE DERIVACIÓN que se ha  desarrollado en una aplicación (App) que facilita su disponibilidad en un formato actual. El contenido llevado a cabo se actualizará según la evidencia presentada. También se editará en PDF y se valorará la posibilidad de realizarla en formato impreso.",

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "Excellent app! This has been an awesome introduction to yoga for me, it's private, at your own pace, peaceful, engaging! The UI is super easy and intuitive, really a blessing! For anyone wanting to get into yoga it's a great no pressure place to start that also helps to keep you on track with a schedule. I HIGHLY recommended it!",
            "Very nice and useful app. I'm just a beginner and I'm already loving the app. Waaay better than the other yoga apps. Even the classes are layed out well. The kriya points makes it even interesting to unlock new classes. Only problem is with the background music. I need to turn off the background music inorder to hear the instructions clearly(keeping background music on makes tge yoga soothing and calm). Thats it. Satisfied with everything else... Kk I wrote a little too much...;-)",
            "I am totally new at yoga. So this is going at a pretty good pace and perfect for a beginner. Looking forward to completing this program and trying more advanced ones in the future weeks and months. I like the video in addition to speaking the directions clearly to be able to follow without having to have too many disruptions or memorizations.",
            "Great! No ads interrupting the session and no asking for my payment info. No complaints so far. The only thing that I believe would push this further is making the settings options a bit more user friendly and having the option to change the music up. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this so far :)",
            "I downloaded this app the end of March(2020) when UK lockdown started. Using it since there is no fault. I enjoy all the daily exercises, every day Is is different, so it's not boring. I was a total beginner, never done yoga before do some of the poses are really challenging, but It doesn't upset me. My flexibility improved a lot but still not there where the guy on the videos."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "description": "From the makers of Plants vs. Zombies 2 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 comes the next great game in the epic battle between doom and bloom – Plants vs. Zombies Heroes. Collect Heroes with outrageous and incredible super powers and build your ultimate battle team. Embark on a journey to discover new characters, and confront mighty opponents along the way. And, for the first time ever on mobile, play as either plants or zombies. It’s the lawn of a new battle!\r\n\r\nCOLLECT YOUR HEROES\r\nCollect and choose from 20 unique Plant and Zombie Heroes and unlock their lawn-inspiring super powers. Will you pick Plants and deploy the masked, sharp-shooting avenger, Green Shadow? Or will you choose a Zombie Hero and call on the superbly superficial Super Brainz, Zomboss’s secret weapon with a powerful punch and fondness for hair gel? Each Hero’s selection of super powers will help determine your team’s winning strategy. \r\n\r\nFORM YOUR TEAM\r\nEvery Hero needs a crew. Build yours and diversify your skills by collecting teammates – from the PvZ characters you know and love, to daring new plants and zombies. There are hundreds to discover! Devise distinct strategies for your Hero by selecting compatible teammates and experiment with devastating combos.

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",

I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard.

Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

        "description": "Cards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\r\n\r\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",

And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",

In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "I thought I was gonna give it another chance but it's way to pay to win. If you guys could lean more towards the free-to-play players and set it a pay-to-win players then this game will be way bigger. You guys add a new character like every month how are free to play players supposed to get those characters? Every time a new character comes out I have 100 Shino bites but it's like 500 to summon that doesn't make sense. Y'all won't see this cuz I drowning in money. Free-to-play games are best!!!",
            "I love this game. It gives you all characters at the beginning and gives you easy chances of earning their cards and developing your village expeditiously and the graphics are amazing. Anything with Naruto I live for and I'm glad I have happen to be introduced to this game. But my problem is that the game consistently logs me out making me have to use the game's currency (Shinobite) just to restore my energy. Other than that I enjoy it and look forward to more ideas unfolding in the game!",
            "Please fix the S.A.M. Event. This is the 2nd time I'm unable to play properly as the game crashes when the mission starts. I already contacted the support team for this before and tried their advise on clearing the cache from the game itself, but the issue persists. And from the looks of it, I'm not the only one having the issue. I actually enjoy this game but the crashing issue with S.A.M. is irritating. Please fix it!",
            "Despite the constant kick out from attack missions, the game is overall good, just gotta work on the app to where it wont kick players out of the attack missions. I am aware that there are others battling the same issue, so im adressing me as well as the others that battle the same issue. The sam missions will not work for me and the team missions for the Naruto ( kumara link mode) aren't working either, please fix these issues for other players and me.",
            "So unfortunate, such great potential, such poor delivery! Now more P2W than ever! Well laid out and easy to navigate with plenty to do and lots of useless characters. New characters are going to be p2w walled requiring upto 8000 Shinobites, which are priced sooo absolutely insanely high for what you get. Psuedo \"daily\" missions never seem to reset, so they should just call them \"monthly\" missions. Ai pathfinding is terrible. A fun game that could be great if they care to actually fix problems..."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I like this because there is not adds. The only time there are adds is if you need coins. If you are also tired of playing these other games that are the same then play GrowCastle . Its fun and active you can join groups and try to be the best group. I play Growcastle when I am bored. I like this game a lot so i think you shuold play it. This is why I am giving it a 5 star rating",
            "Ive played this game for years, and still enjoy playing it. Im on wave somewhere in the thousands now and i still enjoy it. Even at big levels its not really grindy and there isnt many ads at all and you almost have to pay for nothing other than a few things. Though i would really like some new game macanics like just more heros or maybe more things to fight. But more than that there should maybe be more town stuff. I would like more stuff that gets unlocked and changes the game more often.",
            "This game is the best RPG game-type ever! This game has no add pop-ups at ramdom time which is like Tap Titans 2. You must watch an add if needed 3× game speed or free coins. I play this game Grow Castle if I'm bored playing other games. This game makes me addicted like literally can't stop playing this game all day! I love the graphics, controls and even the gameplay! I'd rate this a 5 star for this game! 🤩",
            "I'd say its fun, really simple when you start and once you understand the game it gets more complicated which is great because you don't get overwhelmed. its well paced and a good game to get if you're just looking to try something new. especially because it's not littered with ads you can't avoid. all ads are optional."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "If you're not buying coin/gem packages, you won't enjoy the game. The \"Wild\" games seem to be cursed, you get stuck with someone who doesn't know how to play the game in the \"2 vs 2\" and lose all your coins, and it takes FOREVER just to build your bank back up to play one game and lose again. I used to love playing this game, but it seems like it's damn near impossible to win anymore. But they do give you an option to \"BUY BACK YOUR COINS\" that you've lost. What a setup!",
            "the game was fun until I started noticing that I was losing in matches where I was supposed to win given that the number of cards count was in my favor and not in my opponents and I even screenshot it several times to show that we should have won on several occasions. Not to mention the game is always reconnecting in the middle of a match and buffering to a fast forward part in a short amount of time. Also winnings don't match up in coins. If I win a 100 why does my coin count only go to 40?! 😡",
            "I've been playing this game for 6 months. But since the update. Things have changed. You cant collect coins your friends give you?? My god. Also you cant actually play with friends they just spectate....and you cant get gems for anything no ads nothing, you just get a chance. But the higher level the less likely, or if there is a event happening. I miss the old uno",
            "This game sucks! I've playing for a long time and wasted money on it. But it just keeps freezing not allowing me to play. And when it happens it warns me if this continues that my game will be played automatically. Like it's my fault?! Uninstalling. Never playing this stupid game again. I wish I could get fefunded my money. Thieves.",
            "Following recent app update, I lost my Uno account and was distraught that I had been taken back to square one. It really upset me as I love this app and have been using it for the past months. I emailed their customer service and they were very helpful, guiding me to retrieving my old account. I never expected them to help since so many people use the app but I am taken aback by their support. Thanks for helping me again and I will always love your app!"

            "It's a good game to get lost in. It is an idle game but the afk setting sucks I get no progression when I'm not playing. And in tournament's I havent gotten my gene points so now I'm short by like 20+ and I cant seem to progress much farther without them. Please fix so I can continue to enjoy the game. Other than that the game will go to 5 star if fixed... please",
            "The ads don't always work right, and there's a lot of ads to view... they try to reward you for them proportionally but it still takes you away from the game. Now on my new phone, a Google pixel 4a, it keeps crashing",
            "I once loved this game but then I accidentally deleted it a long time ago and I forgot the name. But now I'm back and there are new updates and that's why I wanna check them out. I really love this game keep updating it it's coming handy.",
            "This game is awesome! I was playing it then suddenly a gold ray appeared! I was shocked.I played it and I reached almost 1300 meters.dont listen to who gived 1 star 🌟.I almost download this game for 6 times.but this game is awesome!!!!!!.",
            "This is one of the best games I have ever played! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! I like the new updates and It has helped me a lot in earning pearls and coins. The events and global matches are great. I can now get various new and exciting rewards by progression and many more. The graphics and gameplay are smooth and it eases my mind when I play this game."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

Not helpful and it doesn't get rid of the problem, so the app remains useless. Still one star.",

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "It was a great app. I had a few different tunings purchased. But now I am unable to restore my purchases. Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",
            "It actually tuned my guitar!!! also has loads of fun interactive games that help you learn/master chords",
            "Honestly this app is amazing no ads and pretty on point with tuning your guitar. Also have had no problems so far, and you don't even need to pay for the tuning part. Really recommend this for someone who is just starting out on playing guitar and wants to learn how to tune your guitar. Definitely 5 star! :)"

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "It's a great app so far but I have run into a slight issue with renaming songs. It seems like if you rename any songs you have downloaded with apps other than samsung music, it doesn't pick up on it. For example, if I have songnameA and I rename it to songnameB, it shows songnameB in the folder but in the app it doesn't change and is still songnameA. In the recently added section however, it shows songnameB, but as soon as I add it to a playlist it changes back to songnameA.",
            "This really is a good music app. It's simple, clean (mostly), user friendly, and not glitchy. I'd only change 2 things, but they bug me enough to drop rating 1 star each. #1 PLEASE add the option to list multiple, separate, Artists and Genres in 'edit Track Details'?! There is one line to list any & all, but if I add 2(+) names or a 'feat', the track won't show up under each artist, only the 2(+) names together. #2 NEED 'Do Not Show Again' box on irritating SiriusXM ad when app starts up.",
            "I have championed this app along with the very polished Internet and email apps Samsung makes. It is smooth, snappy, has good sound, is simple and light. But... Ads... They bothered me for a while, but I'm just learning to suck it up and deal with it. It's a couple of clicks every now and again. It's still the best in terms of functionality playing my local files. I like it's dark theme and generally feels intuitive. One star off because it would still be better without ads.",
            "As of the last three updates this app has been the bug central. The worst of any music apps I've used. The welcome ads; freezing before playing a song; long pauses before deleting a playlist or removing a song from a playlist. What gives? It was never like this before. I wish there was an option to reset it to factory settings. I'll be looking for a new app today.",
            "I had to move to this app because Google play shut down & YouTube music is garbage. It's alright. I can add music to some magical queue but somehow cannot look to see what's in said queue. It's good to make playlists & listen to music on random. However, unlike google play, when I put all my music on random I cant see a queue so I have no clue what's next, cant change my queue, and I dont like that. Unlike google play I cant swipe to the next song, I have to hit next, so in the car is not good."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

            "Don't bother. Worked for about 3/4 days then stopped. Believe the reviews when they say it is unreliable and doesn't update properly. I have messaged the 'support' team several times and each time they ask me to send screenshots and check the settings. Even after all that it still doesn't work. SO glad I didn't subscribe and pay any money for this. This could be why it works so well in the beginning and then stops - maybe this is an attempt to make you subscribe??",
            "The last week this app has not been working well. Location is not accurate. When my son gets home the app location says that my son is still at school. My son has always his location on...There is a malfunction every day with the app... Update 20/10/2020: Still doesnt work properly! It randomly works. Some days it works pefectly and other days it wont. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!! I have had many chats with support but they still couldnt help me. Beginning to regret that I bought this app.",
            "Loved the app when I first downloaded it bit recently it has been rubbish the recordings don't work it doesn't connect to my childs phone it doesnt show the location and does random things even when the phone is locked and child can't access, i have contacted support but they keep saying the same thing and it doesn't work. Really frustrating 😕.",
            "£26 to use the app for only three family members is taking the p!££. AND it doesn't even include everything... they sell minutes packages separately! Just unreasonably expensive, also considering the risk of it not working properly, as highlighted by some reviews. I can't understand... these sort of apps have a great potential, but they're all taking the p!££. Just charge reasonably and you'll have millions of users... it's not rocket science! People don't like to be ripped off, you know?",
            "It will help a lot if we can send a pin location from the chat with parents app when you press the Sos button and als please give us the option to login with the user ID so the ability to login on any phone so much easier to be able to find the kid in need in emergency wen you can't be there in time to help the team looking for the child so the ability to let a team member login to the app for emergency."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "Honestly, I don't think I've played a mobile game anywhere near as good as this one. Not only is the game beautifully polished, from the art, to the gameplay to the sounds, but it's also completely free from all the things that ruin mobile gaming. There are no ads, and the in-app purchases are completely optional. The game is just as fun whether or not you shell out money. The fact that this game is free to play is honestly a miracle. Undoubtedly one of the best mobile games out there.",
            "I got Pokémon Cafe Mix on the Nintendo Switch when it first came out and I have absolutely loved it so far but I really wish I can transfer my data to the mobile version from the switch so I don't have to start all over again and have to do all the missions just to get the Pokémon that come in. Is there a way to actually transfer it to your phone?",
            "Firstly the art style is gorgeous and actually makes me appreciate some of the pokemon I never did before. Secondly there's so many different obstacles that make a lot of rounds feel unique. Overall, quite enjoyable. Once I get into it it's a bit hard to stop!",
            "Super cute! I was having doubts whether to install it or not, when I installed the game man, it was so worth it, nice artwork, very calm gameplay I could just tap all Pokémon while eating and disturb them lol... I just wish that I could design the cafe my own way thou and have a much more open experience in having to design and buy stuff (I don't know if such a feature exist I just started) all in all super cute, and satisfying gameplay thumbs up! :3",
            "Thus game is fabulous! Good for some time pass or whenever bored, there are many pokemons to work with in the cafe! Overall i love it, and i would strongly recommend this to parents also as this could be a nice game for your kids and who knows, you can engage as well! So download thus app and don't keep thos adorable pokemons waiting!!😊👍"

All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

If you uninstall and reinstall the app it is still the old one. There are a reports of people on Reddit experiencing the same issues. A friend of mine has the same issue he had a Samsung GS20+ Android 10 and it won't update to the latest version and he's not alone.",
            "The layout is much better but functionality wise it's worse. The store doesn't allow you to filter so you can't separate dlc from games. Also trying to access my account details (Transaction History, Redeem Code) also doesn't work. I'm prompted for a username and password and keep getting a \"Connection to the server could not be established error\".",
            "New UI is a really mixed bag. It's overall much snappier and the pull down menu for chat and friends is great. However, the new store is terrible! I used to love checking out sales on the app, but its a huge pain now since they completely removed filters like sort by price or alphabetically. Also they bafflingly don't show game titles in plain text anymore(only box art) and some are really hard to read if the text is too small.",
            "New update to the PS Store is a major downgrade. Wishlists are gone which is what I used to keep track of the games I wanted to buy. Browsing through the store is slow and painful now that they only show you box covers instead of easy to read text. Many box covers are hard to read and don't differentiate between full games and addons. This new layout is going lead to me purchasing a much smaller number of games in the future do to the new increased difficulty of finding anything.",
            "The integration of the ps store is great to see as well. I don't know if I'm blind tho but it's a shame the wishlist isn't in the app. Edit: From 4 to 3 stars Also comparing trophies isn't possible anymore and it seems they really emphasized their blogs now. Not everyone reads articles. If you have given special treatment towards the people who like reading articles, hopefully you'd bring back the basic ones you haven't included and removed."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Extremely fun game! Graphics are neat, but the only actual flaw is that is has a little too many ads. I'm cool with it, though. I like how there are multiple evo branches and not just one. And the fact it has other planets to do multiple branches at a time is just plain AWESOME. And the thought put into the game, occasional updates, making sure it isn't buggy, deserves a 6 star if possible.",
            "It's ok... but the last level is bugged and you can't make more per tap. The app is literally plagued with ads... (forced ads). The studio basically reuse the same code for all their games.",
            "I love this game but I would like less ads I got it 25 minutes or more and I already have human love that you can tap to get money",
            "No longer works on my phone. Loads, but the moment it signs into my Google account to save, the game just freezes and I can't do anything. A shame cos I liked this game.",
            "Love the game but to many ads btw when there an ad just come of the game and come back on I think it only works when u have a random ad ✌️"

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",

When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Absolutely Amazing. Very Addictive and Amazing Speed. Just one thing. So many Ads. But other than that it is the best game I have ever played in my whole life. I also love how you put a Daily Race where we actually get to play with real players. I have absolutely nothing to say. Just It is an Amazing game. I recommend you to download this. It's Amazing.",
            "This game was great and made me feel like I was playing mirrors edge all over again. It did have ads, but that's not why I am not giving it 5 stars as it's a mobile game and I only saw an add every 3 to 4 stages. The reason I am rating it 4 and not 5 is the frame rate. Frame rate is key in these sorts of games. It ran smoothly mostly but sometimes I would encounter frame drops, not massive, but enough to send me plummeting to my doom. Otherwise, the controls are great. And no micro transactions"

But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting again😂🤣. It couldn't stop me from laughing.🤣😂🤣",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

After using it for well over a month I found CCleaner to be utterly useless. #1. It doesn't do anything my phone doesn't already do. #2. The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps. Low and behold it was drastically off."

            "It's more difficult to play. I currently have Bolo to fight, my stats are way higher and still not able to beat him. Come on!. Its until I exhaust all the gifts and points. I'm not saying the game should be very easy but we both should have the same level playing ground. I sense that the developer are running out of levels, hence the game has been made unnecessarily difficult to move to the next level. I'm going to end up abandoning this game Smh",
            "The characters are very realistic and is a game worth playing. Great work NEKKI. I have played all your games. You gave us nekki = encouragement. Love all your games. I have played shadow fight 2 and it was great. Shadow fight 3 is better still. But I have one problem. I have started playing the game in my father's phone how do I play it in my mother's phone. Please reply. Father has to go to office and I can't play that while. This is the best game ever. This is my favorite game in the world.",
            "THE best fighting game for android. For people who say its a pay to play game,well its nonsense . I never had a problem no need to pay but you have to play hard and i kinda have like 40 legendary cards so it dosent force you to pay. Events are cool will give you more chances of getting legendary cards . ! NOW JUST WAITING FOR PVP! Please make it happen real fast!",
            "So, this game has good graphics ,but the thing is that when we fight duels if gives us chest ,but if we keep getting strong oppenents which is better then us , then there is 60% that we will lose . And then we will lose trophies and then we cant get rewards that we want at the end of the season , so i hope NEKKI helps this and gives us Like not very strong oppenents like i am at 987 power and when i fight , the oppennent is 995 power , that will be much easier and i will appriciate this game.",
            "The thing i like about this game is that it has realistically functional moves in an environment that does not disregard the laws of physics. Well, there's this shadow energy bit in the game which is quite magical...u can call it a fantasy or something. But hey, a little supernatural element is essential for a good action game. However, it's quite easy you know, it has simple controls, and some of the moves of some weapons can be spammed to win almost any battle."

This one tries to be more than it needs to. From jumping from building to building to jumping random bombs and dodging lasers that make no sense. this feels like a fan game. To over the top and nonsensical. Further in the future would be cool if we had any reason to care. This game wants you to run from nothing for no reason. An unnecessary game.",
            "I honestly liked the first vector more. This one is detailed and complicated while the first one was nice and easy to understand. Another thing I don't like about this one is that you can't restart the level while playing instead you have to finish the whole level first and then try again. It's just that having the restart bottom available in the options is so much more efficient. the last thing is that it doesn't give the star rating of how you did on the level unlike the first one.",
            "Have played \"'thrice\"' from floor 1 to 22 and after each attempt the game makes me start back from level 1 afresh...Thats so frustrating😡😡 i even got into episode 2, twice,but then the game started all over...I love the difficulty of the game and i'm okay with the numerous subjects, but its a no-no situation for the game restarting all over after going very far each time",
            "Fantastic! It's a great advance from Vector 1. Instead of hunting and being hunted it's about running and doing your best! Controls are a little \"not-working\" at the first of each level, but afterwards they become well, this feature adds more excitation. So keep playing and having fun and don't give up!",
            "I luv this game it's very cool and I am very satisfied that we can wear Armor in this one unlike the other one! Ya this game is a little difficult to understand but once u get it it's awesome. But I really loved that a guy chases us in vector 1 but in this one no one chases us so I actually wanted to give 4 1/2 star but we can't so I give it a 5 star. Really liked it and nekki also fixed the issue I pointed out in vector 1. Must play!"

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

            "Been using it for a long time, but then I noticed the battery drain when I got my redmi note 9 pro. Compared poco and Nova, both without any widgets, and Nova had more battery consumption. For now I'll stick to poco. Maybe when I get a new phone (or install a custom ROM) then I'm trying Nova again 😁",
            "Works like it was preinstalled smooth lots of features easy to use you would think it came with your phone if tried over 5 or more apps like me this is the last one excellent choice. 👍🏾",
            "By far one of the best launcher out there. Definitely worth a try.",
            "Used to be great but as my devices have gotten bigger I've noticed that the inability to place folder icons at the bottom of the folder is really becoming an issue, especially if using one hand. Folders are becoming useless in that regard, it's easier just to create another home screen and do your best to organize.",
            "The only flaws I see with Nova and Nova Prime are as follows: I found it hard to set up the backup and restore directories. I always feel I can't to double-check the destination. I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

My android cell phone had an update recently, the app icon has changed and e mail works fine from my phone but not my tablet. I've looked for an update but nothing so far. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail.",
            "Please make a simple way to delete in bulk. Ie, create a check-box to select multiple email at once. (Be sure to advise everyone that they'll have to change sync settings in all Google apps and devices. (Make that easy to do as well!) Or perhaps create a simpler way to check all settings that need apply. *Ease of access is key* It's annoying and is the reason I had to create 25 different Gmail accounts bc we don't have money to purchase any extra storage features. Please and thanks!",
            "Edit: the update got a new logo and now my emails take 30 minutes or more to send. Nice. Very nice. 🙄 This app is very behind compared to other apps. Where is the \"select all\" option? This app will only work with its limited features for those who dont have a lot of emails.For someone like me this isnt a possibility so this will no longer be my main emailing app.",
            "Just like all of Google's other products, this too does not work as expected. All of Google's products are failing lately. I have emails sitting there waiting to be read, but I rarely get a notification of them. And I am talking about the emails in my inbox, not the ads or subscription emails. That part of gmail actually still works quite well with those being separated into separate folders. I'm looking for apps that replace all of Google's apos... might even consider (gasp!) Apple's iPhone!",
            "Updates? Practically every other day but out of 15 emails I had today not one was in primary list. Every day I move them between primary; updates and promotions and still not one in the right place. You work on it every day but as far as I can see not one useful thing comes out of it. Oh yeah!! Beautiful new logo (how long did you work on it?) We really needed that?!?!"
