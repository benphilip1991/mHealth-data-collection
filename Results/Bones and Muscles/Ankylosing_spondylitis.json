            "I've been using this app for my back for years. I didn't realise I hadn't rated it!! Great app. It's really helped me with my back pain as I have a bad posture. In particular I always use the \"Stretching the spine\" exercises.",
            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",

            "Had to uninstall. I could never get it to tell me less than 5 days per week. I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",

            "Having back pain on a daily basis, I have tried these excercises out of desperation . They do work great to alleviate back pain . Even better than pain relievers and i cant tell you how happy I am about this app. Theres only a few excercises, so you can learn them quickly. Now that I do them regularly, it helps stop my back pain BEFORE it starts. I strongly recommend this app to anyone suffering from mild to severe, occasional or chronic back pain. Try it...I guarantee you'll be glad you did.",
            "Great concept! I would suggest verbal instructions, as it is nearly impossible to view the excercises being displayed while doing them. Also, a time gap between the exercises and rest periods of about 10seconds would be more convenient, as this gives one opportunity to switch positions, without having to pause. I would also suggest displaying the exercises (and their demos) before the session starts, as to allow the user opportunity to familiarise themselves with the excercises and do them well!",
            "Good app ,& easy could be better. I like the 6mins just enough to get the chair kinks out. Cannot set to repeat every couple of hours. This needs cues like chimes or dings to tell how long to hold each pose in order to follow avatar without having to constantly keep eyes on the phone, annoying! Transition from resting to next exercise is too fast, is frustrating, and must rush to catch up. That's the reason for stars. Would pay for a pro version if this app was a bit more intuitive.",
            "Very good. Also why did you cut short your per session exercises to 3?. I love the old way of doing all the exercises at once. Please see if you can include all of them.",
            "So cool, there're lots of exercises useful, also has access youtube link to do correct the exercises from trainers. Thanks for all for this app creators 👍👍👍"

        "description": "Sit and stand with proper posture and you will physically look 10 years younger and 10 pounds lighter. Psychologically, good posture conveys confidence, poise and leadership.\r\nUse our App to learn about good posture, poor posture, what causes posture problems and how to fix and improve your posture.\r\n\r\nHow important is correct posture for overall health?\r\nCorrect posture aligns everything in your body. Bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons are all able to function optimally when you sit or stand up straight. Your organs assume their proper placement with good posture.\r\n\r\nThe best way to improve your posture is to focus on exercises that strengthen your core -- the abdominal and low back muscles that connect to your spine and pelvis.\r\n\r\nPosture is the position in which you hold your body upright against gravity while standing, sitting or lying down. Good posture involves training your body to stand, walk, sit and lie in positions where the least strain is placed on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement or weight-bearing activities. Proper posture:\r\n\r\nKeeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are being used properly.\r\nHelps decrease the abnormal wearing of joint surfaces that could result in arthritis.\r\nDecreases the stress on the ligaments holding the joints of the spine together.\r\nPrevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions.\r\nPrevents fatigue because muscles are being used more efficiently, allowing the body to use less energy.\r\nPrevents strain or overuse problems.\r\nPrevents backache and muscular pain.\r\nContributes to a good appearance.\r\n\r\nLiving with bad posture can be a dangerous thing. The muscle and ligament imbalances that result from poor alignment can lead to all sorts of problems:\r\n\r\nChronic back, neck, and shoulder pain\r\nFoot, knee, hip, and back injuries\r\nHeadaches\r\nStiffness\r\nFatigue\r\nMuscle atrophy and weakness\r\nDifficulty breathing\r\nDigestion issues\r\nImpingement and nerve compression\r\nSciatica\r\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\r\nBut we're going to fix that right now! By understanding proper posture, you can learn about your own postural deviations and determine which corrective exercises will work best to improve your alignment. With correct alignment and good posture, your lifts will be stronger, your muscles will work more efficiently, you'll help prevent pain and injury, and you'll look and feel a heck of a lot better\r\n\r\nMany of the exercises that can teach you how to fix your posture are easy to perform and don’t require much in the way of equipment. This means you can discover how to improve posture from the privacy of your home and without investing a lot of money. Try some of these posture exercises to reach a new level of health and fitness.\r\n\r\nExercises with animated GIF pictures are included in this free App",

Proper posture:<br><br>Keeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are being used properly.<br>Helps decrease the abnormal wearing of joint surfaces that could result in arthritis.<br>Decreases the stress on the ligaments holding the joints of the spine together.<br>Prevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions.<br>Prevents fatigue because muscles are being used more efficiently, allowing the body to use less energy.<br>Prevents strain or overuse problems.<br>Prevents backache and muscular pain.<br>Contributes to a good appearance.<br><br>Living with bad posture can be a dangerous thing. The muscle and ligament imbalances that result from poor alignment can lead to all sorts of problems:<br><br>Chronic back, neck, and shoulder pain<br>Foot, knee, hip, and back injuries<br>Headaches<br>Stiffness<br>Fatigue<br>Muscle atrophy and weakness<br>Difficulty breathing<br>Digestion issues<br>Impingement and nerve compression<br>Sciatica<br>Carpal tunnel syndrome<br>But we&#39;re going to fix that right now! By understanding proper posture, you can learn about your own postural deviations and determine which corrective exercises will work best to improve your alignment. With correct alignment and good posture, your lifts will be stronger, your muscles will work more efficiently, you&#39;ll help prevent pain and injury, and you&#39;ll look and feel a heck of a lot better<br><br>Many of the exercises that can teach you how to fix your posture are easy to perform and don’t require much in the way of equipment. This means you can discover how to improve posture from the privacy of your home and without investing a lot of money. Try some of these posture exercises to reach a new level of health and fitness.<br><br>Exercises with animated GIF pictures are included in this free App",

If you are one of the 65 million Americans reporting lower back pain and discomfort on a regular basis, it’s no wonder that we seek relief from this additional stress and strain.\r\n\r\nExercises to Treat Low Back Pain and Sciatica\r\nLower back pain treatment is solved in a number of ways, but not all of these options are accessible to everyone. For those experiencing mild to moderate pain on occasion, all that might be necessary is a simple pain management medication. Other options might be surgical relief or a chiropractic protocol for moderate to severe pain. If cost is an option and you find yourself in need of pain relief in between medical and chiropractic appointments, however, it might be beneficial to try some simple exercises at home to get the blood flowing and those vertebrae moving.\r\n\r\nThese lower back strengthening exercises are a great way to strengthen your low back and your core in general. They also help strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, and other pelvic muscles.\r\n\r\nDoing these exercises regularly has proven to ease lower back pain and provide some relief from the stress that chronic pain can bring to your daily life. Practice these on a consistent basis, and you’ll be feeling better with each repetition.\r\n\r\nDo each of these exercises for 1 minute, emphasis on technique not speed!

There's also a calender to track your training. I cant imagine what the paid version offers. This one has it all, you can create routines and target specific areas.",

            "Really really good app covers all the bases and is tailorable to your needs. The only reason it has 4 stars not five is that there is not sufficient explanation of the exercises. Would deffo get a five if that was provided As an idea for improvement it might be nice to add some gentle music in the background while stretching.",
            "Used it first time this morning. Did the back stretches for 10 minutes... I literally feel like a different person. If there was a pay version to remove the ads at the end, I'd totally do it. Great app and look forward to telling people about it!",

Zo kunnen patiënten zien hoe de oefeningen precies moeten worden uitgevoerd, waarbij ze worden geholpen door een voice-over. Door oefeningen vast te leggen in de app (in ‘mijn oefenschema’s’) kan er afwisseling aangebracht worden in het oefenschema.",

The pain typically comes on gradually, and it affects both feet in about one third of cases. \r\nThe causes of plantar fasciitis are not entirely clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity.

        "description": "The Division of Rheumatology at the University of Cape Town is very actively involved in teaching, service delivery and research.\r\n\r\nTeaching is directed at medical students in their 4th 5th and 6th years of training. There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

(Abnormal inward concave lordotic curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis.) Kyphosis can be called roundback or Kelso's hunchback. It can result from degenerative diseases such as arthritis; developmental problems, most commonly Scheuermann's disease; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; multiple myeloma or trauma. A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st to the 12th vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20° to 45°. When the \"roundness\" of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called kyphosis or \"hyperkyphosis\". Scheuermann's kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females. In the sense of a deformity, it is the pathological curving of the spine, where parts of the spinal column lose some or all of their lordotic profile. This causes a bowing of the back, seen as a slouching posture.",

        "description": "We put a lot of impact on our joints over the years. Eventually they start to show the signs of wear and tear. With age, arthritis can cause the joints in our knees, hands, wrists, and feet to become stiff and sore.\r\n\r\nArthritis also affects the vertebrae in our neck, which get worn down from years of supporting our head. After age 60, more than 85 percent of people have arthritis in their neck, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).\r\n\r\nIf your neck is sore, see a doctor to find out exactly what’s causing your pain. You can visit your family doctor or see a specialist like an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or osteopathic doctor. Your doctor can also advise you on therapies to help relieve the pain such as postural changes, physical therapy, yoga, or Pilates. And your doctor may recommend pain relieving medication or steroid injections.\r\n\r\nYou can also try basic exercises at home. Though you might be tempted to keep your neck still when it hurts, staying immobile will only increase the stiffness. It will also cause you to lose even more movement. Stretching and strengthening exercises will help keep your neck limber and reduce your arthritis pain.\r\n\r\nHere are a few exercises you can try for relieving neck arthritis. Remember to move gently and smoothly through each exercise. Never make any sudden movements or jerk your neck. Twisting and turning your neck is done in the neck rotation exercise. Also, stop if any exercise increases your neck pain.",

And your doctor may recommend pain relieving medication or steroid injections.<br><br>You can also try basic exercises at home. Though you might be tempted to keep your neck still when it hurts, staying immobile will only increase the stiffness. It will also cause you to lose even more movement. Stretching and strengthening exercises will help keep your neck limber and reduce your arthritis pain.<br><br>Here are a few exercises you can try for relieving neck arthritis. Remember to move gently and smoothly through each exercise. Never make any sudden movements or jerk your neck. Twisting and turning your neck is done in the neck rotation exercise. Also, stop if any exercise increases your neck pain.",

        "description": "What Are the Causes of Low Back Pain?\r\nStrains\r\n\r\nThe muscles and ligaments in the back can stretch or tear due to excess activity. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the lower back, as well as muscle spasms. Rest and physical therapy are remedies for these symptoms.\r\nDisc Injury\r\n\r\nThe discs in the back are prone to injury, and this risk increases with age. The outside of the disc can tear or herniate. A herniated disc (also known as a slipped or ruptured disc) occurs when the cartilage surrounding the disc pushes against the spinal cord or nerve roots. The cushion that sits between the spinal vertebrae extends outside its normal position. This can result in compression of the nerve root as it exits from the spinal cord and through the vertebral bones. Disc injury usually occurs suddenly after lifting something or twisting the back. Unlike a back strain, pain from a disc injury usually lasts for more than 72 hours.\r\nSciatica\r\n\r\nSciatica can occur with a herniated disc if the disc presses on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spine to the legs. As a result, sciatica can cause pain in the legs and feet. This pain usually feels like burning or pins and needles.\r\nSpinal Stenosis\r\n\r\nSpinal stenosis is when the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Spinal stenosis is most commonly due to degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae. The result is compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or soft tissues, such as discs. Pressure on the spinal nerves causes symptoms such as numbness, cramping, and weakness. You might feel these symptoms anywhere in the body. Many people with spinal stenosis notice their symptoms worsen when standing or walking.\r\nAbnormal Spine Curvatures\r\n\r\nScoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis are all conditions that cause abnormal curvatures in the spine. These are congenital conditions and are usually first diagnosed when patients are children and teenagers. The abnormal curvature places pressure on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and vertebrae, causing pain and poor posture.\r\nOther Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other conditions that cause lower back pain. These conditions include arthritis, fibromyalgia (long-term pain and tenderness in the joints, muscles, and tendons), spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spinal bones), and spondylosis (a degenerative disorder that may cause loss of normal spinal structure and function). Although aging is the primary cause of spondylosis, the location and rate of degeneration is individual.\r\n\r\nKidney and bladder problems, pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and cancer can also cause low back pain.\r\n\r\nread more just download our app now \r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain app :\r\n\r\n- symptoms\r\n- signs\r\n- Risk and Prevention\r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- symptom \r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰\r\n✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰",

        "description": "Back pain is pain felt in the back of the body. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected.\r\nThe lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body.\r\n Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\r\nBack pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.\r\nBack pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed days off work.

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "I could never commit to the eye exercise tips on YouTube. I went through this app's exercises and then walked into a shopping centre here. The whole experience was eye opening. Normally my vision is always blurred. While going into the shops, buying face masks, returning to my car, I had clear vision. Normally faces are blurred. Not this time. I could even see faces in cars, except those with dark tinted windowscreens. I couldn't see the 3D image in the app. Maybe one day I will.",
            "I only review a few apps But this one was worth it. I just wish that it would a few other advices about eye health,that would improve awareness of what we do, but I can't take away the great idea, job and the small size of the app.it is great job by the developer of the app.",
            "Used it for the first time tonight and i never realised how tight the muscles around my eye were. It felt like the muscles were being stretched, especially with the eye circles. Instant relief for a software testers eyes, great stuff",
            "My eyes does feel less tired after the exercises! Great apps!",
            "Pros: I could feel my (left) eye discharging tension as I did the exercises. I didn't realize how much stress my left eye had been holding. Definitely a very helpful app. Cons: I would like to see a note at the end of the exercise encouraging the continuation of the exercises by expanding the range of motion. I. E., repeat the exercises using the corners of a book or room, and not just the corners of the phone."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "Used to be good, but after the recent update you can't collect enough resources to advance the game unless you pay. Edit: the reply from the game rep is innacurate. I had plenty of resources, almost enough to upgrade and the next day, everything was gone and have never been able to save any resources to play the game, let alone make the game easier.",
            "I was enjoying it but I'm tired of always being lowest might in arena. Everytime I upgrade drastically, magically when I join another arena match, everyone else doubles and triples my might. I literally took all my gear off and my might was 35k and everyone in that room were 100 to 300k, I waited for rounds to end and equipped my gear which had me at 326K and then everyone was 550k to 725k. Complete bs. Yep, definitely a money grab game.",
            "Odds of winning items and the rewards given are getting poorer as the GREED for money grows. I play but have lost interest. I quit spending hundreds to get everything. If money is no object you will enjoy. Support services are the worst. Robots with no helpful info...just scripted responses. . I lowered my review for the lame scripted response you added to my comment. It doesnt work.",
            "1. The game glitches way too much 2. The game crashes every 20 - 30 minutes while playing it 3. Its a pay to win game 4. Its so slow loading and loading 5. The game sucks U should have a 2builders from the start and the limit of 5builders, And have a competetive fight only your level can fight you, because i play it then i challenge some raids, after it resets there is a 1.5m powered guy And I only have 200k power, how am i supossed to beat that?!",
            "Mobile Crusader kings meets building combat games like SoS. The gameplay is a mix of those two, really grindy and very much aimed toward wallet warriors. Can still progress f2p but really slowly. My game experience is hindered by long loading times and lag, didn't matter if I used my phone or gaming rig with bluestacks was still slow. Takes forever to load in and any pvp. Frequently, my commands aren't even done due to lag."

It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",

I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates.

Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

At last I want to tell you this app is very nice please download it and do exercise at home regularly and stay fit. I also thank all those who make this app. This app is very helpful. Once again Thankyou all 🙏🙏😉😉",
            "I absolutely love it! First of all, you don't have to pay for keeping your body healthy like most off the other apps(I got no money). Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

It shows me an ad after EACH status I download, which means if you download 5 statuses, it will show you 5 ads, and every one of them takes 5 seconds to disappear... Developers, what's going on with you? Thanks and goodbye, this app is trash... This wasn't happening a few weeks back.",

And the \"home\" screen has a huge banner that's hard to remove, it says \"more statuses\" and has a lot of languages. I guess they want me to download statuses from people I don't know. I hate this app now. Why did I have to pay if you still show me banners? I don't want to see \"more statuses\". All I want to see are my contact's statuses",
            "The app is so beauty full i like the app and gave 5 stars one thing is amazing in this app we can download our friends status to and once we download the status it stays in our gallery for many months and we can download status about (love,friends,father's day,mother's day,sad,heart broken) still one thing is amazing in this app we can see which in ever languge we want there are many languges like( kannada,tamil, telgu,marthi,hindi,english,arabic) etc ............................ i love this app",
            "Best Status app ever Ive tried a couple of status downloaders and i can twll you this is the best. No adds. You can watch or view your seen status one after the other without having to go bavk to select. The flow is seemless and does not consume much data. 100/ 100 for me",

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "I love this game, it is a good one, but lately I have found a lot of server connection errors specially in this last update so try to fix this problem as soon as you can. I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard. (Not all) > Don't forget to enjoy!!! #ComeToOurClanWeDoHelpEachOther. III % (Clan Name)"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Great app. I waited till after I was done with the 21 day challenge to review. I did the challenge everyday and I did this with 5 bottles of water and intermittent fasting as well. After the 3rd week I added 35 to 45 min of treadmill and very light lifting 3x a week. I've only been on the scale once. So far I've been feeling amazing no more bloating. My family has noticed my weight loss. I've lost 5 lbs. It's not much but it's a start. Love the app!",
            "I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ♡.",
            "The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw",
            "I've been using for a couple weeks and I really like how simple and easy this app is...gives me no excuse not to work out bc most workouts are just 10mins! I am doing the full body 28 day challenge and it's actually really enjoyable. I feel good after the work out and want to do at least one more. Really enjoyable women's fitness app. Not to much and not to little. Just right for this mom. 💃",

It keeps up with your workouts, your diet, and let's you pick what part of your body you want to exercise with or just stretch. It does a lot for you and gives you reminders for when to work out.

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

        "comments": [
            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "Grow castle is an amazing game. They are constantly fixing bugs and adding new enemies and hero's to the game. They have clans so you can play multiplayer and chat with other people about the game and you can continue having fun for a long time as they have dragon/boss fights that continue up to months past you're download of the game. It can be played competitively and casually and overall it's a game that I think everyone should download at least once. I think they should add more music.",
            "I like this because there is not adds. The only time there are adds is if you need coins. If you are also tired of playing these other games that are the same then play GrowCastle . Its fun and active you can join groups and try to be the best group. I play Growcastle when I am bored. I like this game a lot so i think you shuold play it. This is why I am giving it a 5 star rating",
            "Ive played this game for years, and still enjoy playing it. Im on wave somewhere in the thousands now and i still enjoy it. Even at big levels its not really grindy and there isnt many ads at all and you almost have to pay for nothing other than a few things. Though i would really like some new game macanics like just more heros or maybe more things to fight. But more than that there should maybe be more town stuff. I would like more stuff that gets unlocked and changes the game more often.",
            "This game is the best RPG game-type ever! This game has no add pop-ups at ramdom time which is like Tap Titans 2. You must watch an add if needed 3× game speed or free coins. I play this game Grow Castle if I'm bored playing other games. This game makes me addicted like literally can't stop playing this game all day! I love the graphics, controls and even the gameplay! I'd rate this a 5 star for this game! 🤩",
            "I'd say its fun, really simple when you start and once you understand the game it gets more complicated which is great because you don't get overwhelmed. its well paced and a good game to get if you're just looking to try something new. especially because it's not littered with ads you can't avoid. all ads are optional."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",

Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",

I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "The app is good, I can communicate with other fans and my idols but the main problem is notifications 😶I don't know when my idol post something or comment on someone's post. Normally everyone gets notifications but I don't at all. Secondly the translation; it's very bad. It misinterprets what people post a lot like all the time. So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand 😐 cause of the translator. Please fix these issues 🙂",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! 🙂",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! 👍",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high rating😂 Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

            "I really really enjoyed the exercise. Although im almost fainting but it was worth it. Im feeling pains in my joints.😂. I also love the water tracker app. I sometimes go a day without drinking water but with this app, im pretty sure im gonna drink a lot of water and stay hydrated. Hopefully i won't have much migraines. Weldone",
            "The app is incredible. I have completed 60 days and now I have started again from beginning. I recommend this app for all those who are above and below age 18. Though my height haven't increased yet I do this daily because exercising everyday is good for health. I hope that my height would increase some day as it depends on each one's body hormones. I have some suggestions for your app. You could add some yogas, some music, the tips of the process of inhalation & exhalation in every exercise. 😘",
            "It is a nice app . I think I can increase my height with this app .It have lot many exercises without any equipment, wow 😍 and have a planned diet and sleep tracker too . It's very helpful app. But the reason of giving it 4 stars is that in diet ,it includes lot many non veg things which I hate 😠😡 actually. You should ask this thing in introduction before planning when you ask about age ,height, etc. It will be better if you do this change. Plzz ,accept my request and do make change.",
            "Amazing i think it is going to be a good trainer and animated images and videos are also given in it. It not only tells about exercise but also about nutrition plus sleep and every exercises are increase and daily new tips of nutrition is also given with it. I think it will increase my height and the further after2 months i will post about it but i liked the app very much😘😘",
            "It's great experience to show how much you can stretch and get height this is my second day training I've grown only just a tiny bit I think but I'm getting their confidencre guys never give up or don't believe always believe in your self. I think this is a helpful review for other people to understand what to do and in all workout apps too."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

        "description": "Welcome to the fantasy world of Butchero — one of the top 3D action adventure games where you can be any rogue hero like warrior or hunter and become the legend of the realm. Nothing will stop you, except for hideous monsters that you will have to defeat on your way to glory in one of the most epic RPG games you’ve ever played.\r\n\r\nThe unique action RPG mechanic makes it stand out against other roguelike games and will never let you get bored. Each new attempt at getting through the countless hordes of enemies, unlike in many fantasy RPG games, will be completely different. This roguelike RPG game will allow you to combine acquired skills of archery, spear throwing, or swordsmanship in a new and more effective way. Rush your hero to the victory, using different magic skills, and turn a simple rogue to a real dungeon master. The more attempts you make, the farther your hero will get in the journey, slicing through enemies like a hurricane of wrath and pure rage. Moreover, you can play this action adventure RPG offline and improve your warriors.\r\n\r\nCHOOSE YOUR EPIC HERO\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to choosing a rogue hero in action RPG games, there are always at least a few options. In the Butchero idle RPG you can choose one of two characters:\r\n\r\n• Butchero – a powerful and noble nomad archer and spearman that possesses unparalleled strength and will to survive;\r\n• Liv – a stunning warrior princess with quick attacks, unparalleled archery skills, and an absolute rogue demeanor.\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR HERO\r\n\r\nAs most online hero games and RPG games do, Butchero allows you to improve your characters. It’s not just an archery game and it’s far more than any of the regular dungeon games:\r\n\r\n• Collect and utilize powerful weapons, whether a sword, bow, and arrow, spear, etc.;\r\n• Use special spirits to boost your warrior’s might;\r\n• Put the strongest armor on your character to give them better protection from enemy attacks in every arena;\r\n• Equip your warrior with rings that provide additional boosts to various traits in this fantasy RPG;\r\n• Take advantage of amulets to come on top in battles in each of your attempts at this roguelike game;\r\n• Improve your warriors’ equipment using special scrolls to increase your chances at victory in this epic RPG.\r\n\r\nBOOST YOUR CHARACTER’S TALENTS\r\n\r\nThe fantasy world of Butchero is not an easy place to survive in, which makes it drastically different from most mobile action games. Depending on your characters’ main features – bow masters or expert swordsmen – you should improve their talents accordingly to achieve the best stats and help them become a true dungeon master:\r\n\r\n• Maximize health for better endurance in battle;\r\n• Boost attack indicators to defeat enemies faster;\r\n• Improve healing abilities to recover from damage quicker;\r\n• Reinforce the iron shield to protect your warrior from enemies;\r\n• Boost the leadership talent to heal upon gaining new levels in battle;\r\n• Improve agility to perform quicker moves and attacks;\r\n• Enhance equipment to get better indicators from your armor, weapons, spirits, etc.;\r\n• Get the time reward talent to get additional XP points by passing levels quicker;\r\n• Upgrade the inspiration talent to get additional skills at the start of each attempt.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE AND INTUITIVE GAME INTERFACE\r\n\r\nUnlike hunting games and most fantasy games for free, Butchero offers its players a simple and intuitive interface that they can master in a blink of an eye:\r\n\r\n• Simple controls allowing to play with just one hand;\r\n• Tutorial at the beginning of each battle;\r\n• No special buttons or complex combinations – either move or attack;\r\n• Get bonuses during the battle, improving your chances at success;\r\n• Open free chests with coins, diamonds or equipment on a regular basis;\r\n• Unique fights with bosses and tons of enemies with unique traits;\r\n• Offline gameplay.\r\n\r\nJoin one of the most captivating RPG games for free today.

I didn't have a better or Any thing at all besides my starting weapon!",

This is the only app I get a \"network error\" on.",

Otherwise it has been great, I'm really enjoying the app! Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",
            "The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",
            "It actually tuned my guitar!!! also has loads of fun interactive games that help you learn/master chords",
            "Honestly this app is amazing no ads and pretty on point with tuning your guitar. Also have had no problems so far, and you don't even need to pay for the tuning part. Really recommend this for someone who is just starting out on playing guitar and wants to learn how to tune your guitar. Definitely 5 star! :)"

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "Editing my rating as most players have reached the end game. There's not enough new content to make players engaged and because of that a majority of players have quit and are close to quitting. Wish they'd put out more fresh content rather than the same events over and over and the occasional new hero that doesn't really change anything.",
            "The game was really good at first but now im hitting a wall and its taken all the fun out. Had a max lvl character, so i use rebirth to get him stronger. About 5 to 6 thousand exp potions to max his lvl back out, and his attack goes from 10254 to 10259. Then with my one bonus attack lvl up gained from rebirth im now at a whopping 10284...the rebirth system needs to be fixed. You put in too much get a miniscule boost and still be stuck in the same spot. Not putting money into this game.",
            "Nice game overall. Started playing because I am a big ToG fan but rate up hero guarantee at 100th roll is kind of upsetting. It is annoying that you can't select the rate up hero. it's 50/50 chance of getting either at guarantee cuz pick up heroes there r always two not just one. For example I ve gotten so many Bams but not enough Khuns. I hope there's selection feature. but overall f2p friendly.",
            "It's a truly fun game. I love the art style and how the gameplay looks. I personally think this game would be a lot better if you didn't have to sit through every battle when auto doing a mission, maybe do a skip ticket thing like DB legends, but idk.",
            "I love the game,but I hate the fact that update infos always come at last second so you cant even prepare for anything in advance and there is zero communication with the devs and they dont listen to feedback at all unless its game breaking abusable bugs that could cause them to lose money. So yeah,typical gacha that getting units dont matter in the end if you get shafted at building their gear and get cucked by RNG even after farming for months for something specific."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

(This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",

I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest!

            "I really... Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",
            "Why is it that I always get a 2 star superstar out of a premium I dont understand this concept is this luck or It is decided before itself that a 3 or a 4 star is not available in a premium otherwise this game is good! Keep it up!"

            "I love this editor, it's easy to use, doesn't crash like others I have tried. The 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because of the time it takes to process the final video. Other apps for a 5 minute video takes around 5-7 minutes, this one took 30 minutes, which to me is far too long. Especially when some of my videos will be at least 15 minutes long. I'm dreading the wait on those ones.",
            "Awesome easy to use video editor! Many great features. I accessed and edited right from the videos on my Android phone! Others I tried were awkward and not as many simple to use features. Try it out and 0lay around with the music and effects , just to name two out of dozens. You'll love it! No, I don't work for the developer! Lol😁",
            "This is great app. No watermarks and excellent editing software capabilities. Easily rivals computer editing software. My only problem is there's no backspace or Ctrl+Z (however you wanna say it) so if you make a mistake, you can't undo it. Please add one and this will be my new favourite editing app. It's also user friendly! :D highly recommend",
            "I've used it once so far but it is very handy. It has variety of music and I read the option to even put your own. It allows you to add to your photos as text, transitions, music, and many other things!! What I had used was ALL FREE. Definitely recommend. There are adds but eh everything has ads now-a-days",
            "It's actually nice and user friendly specially for the ones who aren't that 'techy' . However, there was one problem that I faced which was that when you try to add any media at the starting of the video once it has been made, the whole audio that is attached to the previous media moves in front and leading to all the audios to move ahead. When you try to push the audio back it actually kind of gets trimmed."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "I don't review apps, but this one's special. I didn't and don't know anything about editing videos, but this made it super simple to learn... Step by step instructions and a tonne of features even without the pro version. This and the GoPro video editing apps are the best I've found for mobile. Going to buy pro... I think they deserve the revenue. I'm using it a lot with zero issues... Very happy. Thank you very very much🙏",
            "I really love this editor, it's simple enough to work with, and yet sophisticated enough to make awesome videos. Other editors have their watermark on the free version but this app doesn't and it's light enough for older phones to edit long full HD videos. It perfect for simple videos for YouTube/Facebook. Only thing missing is adding a fading effect at the end of the video, maybe it's only in the pro version? but it would be nice to have in the free version as well.. well deserved 5 stars..",
            "This is absolutely extraordinary. I have tried many other video-editing apps such as \"Kinemaster\" and \"VivaVideo\" but this is by far the best. The others contain alot of ads, glitches and are generally messed up. However this app has no video ads, (only small ones that are rare) it is very neat organised with the icons so that you can easily access and find your needed edit, I have been using it for a long time now and yet I have found no bugs or pay to win problems. I highly recommend this app.",
            "Great app but I already paid the one time fee and it just made me pay it again. When I tried to restore my premium it just kept giving me a fail error. I didn't even uninstall the app. Welp, now I realized I paid 12.99 for nothing because every time I open a photo or video I get an error message 4106 failed to open file?!? Now I can't even use this app.",
            "It's great. But sometimes It can be a pain to fix the mistake. But so far it has not done anything to me. Plus on top of that there is no watermark and you can fade the music in and out. Which would be perfect. Even though we may lost a few file.....it does not go well. Anyway I prefer this app to help me some few edit."

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

After entering a site gotta go back and redue the process all over again. I don't know why this has been given so many stars ether it was useful after so many upgrades or someone likes given good ratings to crappy apps just too make other people mad.",
            "This app is really very amazing. Awesome, It cleans the whole phone in few seconds. I have never seen a phone cleaner like this. But there is very small problem and that is ads , we cannot do anything about ads. Nowadays every app contain ads. To remove ads we have to pay money 😭😭😭. Overall this app is the best phone cleaner. I have one small request to remove ads from this app👍.",
            "I like the app, but when using it advertisement pop up and if my phone rings app will not release the screen so I can answer the call. I watch most of the adds but I don't like anything that takes o Dr my phone. This may cause me to delete app again!! Just checked something today,the app has a cach cleaner. After I cleaned cach with your app, I went and checked cach on each and every app on my phone and had to clear them myself!",
            "Good app. But the ads are pretty annoying and if you want to remove them you need to pay real money for it . Wish there was an app with no ads no more annoying things . But aleast it's a pretty cool app , it can boost your phone in a second if you're phone lags so much . It will junk all the useless stuff in your phone which makes the phone cleaner. I recommend you guys to download the app",
            "This app is the best it made my phone to stop hanging and now I can use my phone without the worry of it crashing 😉 I really hope they prosper and more apps that are better than this. That's my reason for giving it five stars 😁."

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats £7 a month, over £80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

Avoid!",

HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",

There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

It just depends on how quick you wanna build up. I do love that the games is constantly evolving. Maybe more codes or giveaways??? Keep up the great work! I'm not going anywhere!",
            "What the hell happened? I had a great game with great characters. I was level 70. Everything was going great. Then, the game f***ed me over! I am now level 32. All the characters I built up are gone. Everything I worked for. One minute, I am on top of the world. The next minute, the game is kicking me in the groin. If they did this to me, they could do it to you. Don't let them.",

As well you can't level up nearly as fast as you need to without paying. So it's definitely pay to win. Occasionally you even get beat by groups that have characters that are all 40+ levels lower than your own. Edit:... Down to one star. Even as a player who's paid in a bit. You still end up stuck or killed by people you should easily slaughter.",

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

Not only do they spawn with unbeatable set ups sometimes, they have up to 6,000HP is as high as I've noticed. I have 717HP, still a 1-shot with anything let alone this.

When you are playing the game and you are near The spikes but not even close to them to where they should hurt you, they decrease your damage anyway That is something that needs to be fixed. Also, please bring back death Battle, I'm not even sure why you got rid of it in the first place It was actually a good feature to this game!",
            "Too easy,I beat it all within a week,there should be more leagues. But overall,a good game."

            "It's honestly addictive once you get the hang of it, which doesn't take long! And so far it's easy to level up and progress in the game unlike other games like this. Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

        "comments": [
            "Really fun game. Huge variety of units to buy. Love the offline earnings aspect of the game, which helps offset the huge cost of leveling them up. Each stage last under 5 minutes so you can rapidly advance through stages. Although it can be difficult, especially boss stages. Well worth a download.",
            "Whoever thought of the concept of Towerlands, certainly knew how to think outside the box. An extremely unique concept and gameplay style. Haven't had the crashing issues other players have experienced (Phone: Samsung S9, Samsung A5). The English translations are oddly done, but they have a unique charm to them that I've grown to appreciate. Ads aren't intrusive, and you can easily save up gold while not playing. Premium transactions are way overpriced; I'm definitely willing to pay otherwise.",
            "Had to edit my rating, the game is currently unplayable. Try to load it and if I'm lucky enough to have the game load once I click to to anywhere it immediately crashes. I have sent crash report explained in detail what has happened. Hope this gets fixed soon, I do enjoy the game but haven't been able to log in for many days now.",
            "You beat wave 4000 and the game crashes, the game shows you are on 4001 but you are still on 4000 and cannot beat it, since it will alwaya crash. It happens for everyone who is that far. I will cancel my membership, this is the worst bugged game I've seen so far. The rankings are bugged since the beginning and the devs do nothing...",
            "I've loved the game so far but for the past three days I have not been able to launch the game past the loading screen. It sort of bugs out and goes back to my phones home screen. Any answers to when this could be fixed so I can continue?? Edit: has been working great, love the game 🙏🏻"

            "Good graphics (mouth movements need some help.), good storyline, some inconsistencies, but, not too bad. EXPENSIVE! Unless you have A LOT of patience and timing. The 8 hour conversations, that take 30+ energy to complete 1/5 of it. Ridiculous. And , forbid, you can't make it back in time to finish it..... all that time and energy wasted. I spent some money in the game and regret it. It really isn't worth it. Do the math.",
            "I love this game! The storyline, characters mini games and more. However I do have a minor issue with the energy. It runs out really quickly and takes quite a long time to recharge again. Another small thing with the energy is sometimes if I'm over the energy limit, the excess energy I collect does not count and sometimes I lose a bit of energy because of this. However amazing game! Definitely worth downloading :)",
            "Frustrating at times, when it comes to events. You either have to be willing to put in real money or accept the fact you aren't going to win. Dueling spell chances are overpowering against you, only getting 1 stun in three matches (which is often)! While the opponent can get it one every 2-3 spells to maximum effect. The story is good and thrilling, good character relationships and lore. I've been playing since day one but you can see where the money grab is, which I have fallen into?",
            "New review: I've been playing this a lot since lockdown, and am contantly impressed with the creativity and new stuff the devs come up with, for what is essentially a free game. Yes, they do push real money transactions, but if you don't mind spending more time on it, you get everything anyway. This game has an interesting story, lots of side quests, animals to interact with and loads of options to customise your character and dorm. And all of it in Hogwarts! :)",
            "The game can be fun sometimes so I put 2 stars. However, its really just a scheme to make as much money from the players as possible. While the idea is a free to play concept, the amount of time it takes to recharge energy is actually ridiculous. They are constantly releasing time sensitive events that give the players less than 5 days to complete which on the surface is fine and kind of fun. But it is literally impossible to complete all of the tasks with the limited energy = pay to win game."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending.

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",
            "After I changed device..from asus max pro m1 to xiaomi redmi note 8 it gives error and I can't use my 1 year subscription...i try to subscribe with 1 month subscription..my money has been deducted but still..it gives error.. Update - 27/10/20 Syukur Alhamdulillah now everything goes back to normal.. Thank you for your response."

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "I've been using busuu for learning languages for 2 years. Overall I like it, all the lessons it's easy to understand for us that know nothing in every language we want to learn. I paid premium cause I always overseas and I need to use the app offline. But when it comes in offline mode, sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't work. I download all the chapter, but it always says I have a connection problem. But offline means I dont need any connection to use the app, right?",
            "There seems to be a little problem on correction. I've been experiencing the problem for at least a month, I guess. Whenever I correct someone, the corrected world that has been highlited in green, disappears after I sent the correction. The same goes with the stars. I grade stars but it disappears after I sent the correction. No highlights on stars or corrected words.",
            "I really like this app, and I have a Premium Plus subscription. One of the things that makes it more appealing is its vocabulary feature. Duolingo, for example, doesn't allow you to review vocabulary, and Busuu does. However, the vocabulary feature is very lacking. I wish this app took an approach like SpanishDict, where it lets you know if you only miss a single letter instead of counting the whole thing wrong. Also, it counts it wrong if you add the article (los) in front of the vocab word.",
            "I cancelled the subscription in Google play, however it was apparently set to renew on the online version. I received no warning that busuu were going to charge £120 for 2yrs subscription. I email their service team immediately and explain that it was not wanted and to please refund. They refused, quoting policy. This is blatantly opportunistic and a terrible way to treat a customer who used the service for the previous 2 years. The app is also inferior to duolingo, this may shape their attitude",
            "1. When someone corrects your stuff, the notification pops up directly over the \"next page\" button while studying. If you tap on it by accident, you get to the correction and have to start the whole lesson again from the very beginning. 2. An option to sort vocab from newest to oldest would be very helpful. 3. You can't set vocab on \"learned/green/ignore\" by yourself. 4. The new system with stars and competition (if you want) is amazing! I love it."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

I am using Note 4, which is an old phone. There comes out Ad, surely. I don't complain. But it is a little annoying. I wanted to use this App to control screen command. You can find screen control on Settings-Acccessibility-Dexterity and Interaction- Assistant Menu. If you turn on Assistant Menu, you can control Lock screen and someother functions.",
            "Really a nice and useful app!!...at last found something very muvh useful!!...very much helpful and cool features!.....it's handy and a lot lot useful!...excellent!...that's why imma so impressed and rated 5 stars!😆😆...I definitely recommend it to people...and it's not choppy at all...and imma not facing any prblm with it. So,i think it's a lot lot better than other such apps....so good and useful!!!",
            "The app is good but it wants many permission that are actually not needed for this and also need many critical permission that should not allowed for apps . It does not work if it does not have all permission. It also make device slow . So 4 stars are good for this app . Leave a like if it is helpful. Thank you",
            "This app has indicated several times each day that there is an update available. Thus far there are three instances of it on my tablet - versions 3.1.31, 3.92, and 2.7.09. Ads are everywhere and disruptively obtrusive - flashing, changing colors, and overall annoying! There are so many distractions that I'm sure I haven't completed the setup of any installation. Good idea but poor execution! As soon as I finish posting this review I'll uninstall all versions and go back to Google Assistant.",
            "This is nice! I got this after realised tht my phone screenshot button was not efficient. However this assistive button keep missing from my screen eventhough i never force stop or hibernate the app. I hope ur team can look further for this issue. Thanks n hv nice day!"

With this app, I can make my call, add an appointment, view the location via google map, see who's calling, block spam calls AND spam texts all from 0NE app. And i'm discovering much more I can get done each time I use it. I was so thrilled I coughed up the ten bones to get rid of the ads. Update: Wow! This App is SO amazing! Now using the app for a few days. You guys are freaking geniuses !",
            "Extensive, very detailed and lots of features. I am slowly discovering all features of the app. Recordings this far are good. To.remove adss @ $8 is a little steep. I say charge less and forgo the enticement of the 2 free gifts which a person may not want such as my case I want to buy the app but don't need the gifts...",
            "Great app, does everything it says and more, you won't be disappointed, the only one thing I I hoped for was to no who was in my profile but it didn't have it in my region, except for that everything is brilliant,well this is a year ago I wrote this, I noticed my review, I still have this app and its amazing in every way, I really don't think I could go without it, definitely worth installing, easy to use and it has beautiful colours and lots more.",
            "It's a great app but the call recorder does not store the recording names but shows private number even though the name of the caller is stored on my phone. I have a huawei P30 lite 2020 and I have upgraded to premium. I would like to see the name of the caller in call recording. How do I fix this?",
            "Extremely disappointed...calls are recorded but there's no audio when playing back. I downloaded the app to ensure calls are recorded and that it can be accessed when needed, and now I can't hear the audio of a very very critical recording."

            "Cannot listen to most of the music I purchased on Google Play in this new app. I was always reluctant to \"buy\" music online like on Google Play and this is exactly why. Seems like it must intentionally be a scam, because otherwise there's absolutely no excuse for Google not making it a crystal clear and perfect transition for previously PURCHASED music.",
            "Awful! The quality of sound is subpar. Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",
            "Worst app ever. Way to take a step backwards. I want a refund for all my purchased songs through google play! I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",

That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

            "I've used this only for 10min of having it downloaded first impression, it is really awesome. I would like to add one thing at the start of opening the app instead of going into YouTube have something on screen pop up that tells you how to use the control centre because trying to figure it out at the start was tricky but then I watched the video and saw that there was a transparent green line to indicate where the control centre was. Other than that you've made a beautiful app",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 years now and I love it. It mimics the IOS control center the best. However, I have encountered a lot of glitched and issues since the last update. For starters, the control cent now gets stuck halfway on my screen when I swipe left to use it. The swiping used to be very smooth, now it is choppy. Edit: I know you need ads, but your ads play in the background even when IM NOT in your app. Recent glitch that started since last update. Could you please fix it?",
            "I love/hate this app! I hate it because every time I open the app and I click one button inside the app, it will trigger an ad, ALWAYS! And it constantly want me to screen record even if I don't click the record button (also the color black in color is not there and I can't turn on the blur setting). And I love this app because it is so smooth and the music playlist works. I recommend adding more customisable buttons and more feature to this app. I'll rate 5 if you guys did this 👍👍",
            "Best app for control center BUT AFTER THE LATEST UPDATE, THE PANEL DOESNT SLIDE AUTOMATICALLY. I have to swipe all the way to the end of my screen! Please fix this and i'll come back to use this app! update: i think it's been some time since this problem is existing....... isn't the developer fixing this issue....",
            "Everything was well and doing great until the recent update. Now, I had to swipe the control center from start to the opposite edge of the screen or else the control center will get stuck halfway. It really ruined the experience because I use it everytime. I shouldn't have click the update button. I'm uninstalling for now, I hope this gets fix soon. Edit: It only gets stuck in the midway when I half swipe (I positioned it on my lower right screen) when I'm using the live screen blur background"

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",

I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",

Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Not sure what's happening at the moment but Shazam is not picking up any songs, it's struggling with movies, TV shows, new releases etc etc. I do absolutely love this app, but I'm missing so much good stuff! I just hope all my recordings you're taking is going to good use! I'd love to see some stats. It scares me how much you take on of everybody's lives when they use your app. Please be smart, safe and sensible with our lives 🙏💪🥰 #illgiveahigherreviewsoon",
            "This is awsome! I was wondering how could i identify the music I've been watching in YouTube, cause the owner of the video didn't credit the song. I was finding a way to detect this song and i found the Shazam app it was a great pleasure to detect my interest song in just a seconds! Great job! It was useful to other people who wanted to find their fav song! I gave 5 stars ✨ keep it up shazam! ❣️",
            "EDIT: Tray icon added. Now I can instantly launch 5 Stars, like I promised, leaving my original review intact... OK so far... But I just want a button in the notification tray, I don't want the bubble on screen the entire time. Sure, I can move it around, but that's a pain. If there is some way to ONLY have something in the notification tray, it's 5 stars otherwise.",
            "I was using an app from sony on an old xperia but they discontinued the app, been using this for a year or two now, helps when finding a song from a movie or the show I'm watching, since upgraded to a new phone I get an issue now and again it keeps the app open and recording for songs apparently, manage to get it cancelled but it happens again over time",
            "Like many others, I'm uninstalling Shazam due to Shazam recently adding a persistent notification alert that can't be dismissed. Sorry Shazam, I don't need your un-dismissible spam cluttering my notification area, especially when I only use your app a few times a year. Whoever added the un-dismissible notification to the app deserves to be fired and never work in the tech industry again!"

            "Love Outlook! Always have! I've used other formats & platforms over the years, when working at someone else's house or office, or using equipment not my own, but nothing has ever come close to matching the complete package that is Outlook. It's extremely user friendly & even the tech-challenged can usually sort their way through pretty much any function, with relative ease. I have always used Outlook & at 55 years old, don't imagine I'll be changing anytime soon.",
            "I use this for work. There is often an extremely long delay between getting a notification for an email and actually being able to view it. The email will be instantly available in Outlook online, but can take up to 5 minutes to load in mobile. The app sends notifications for meetings 15 minutes in advance, but clearing the notification in any way just results in the app resending the notification. Oh, it does the same thing with \"meeting has ended\" notifications. Atrocious app design.",
            "On my old Samsung phone I had the outlook app and NEVER had problems with it. I have had a new phone for 2 weeks and this app has had endless problems. It freezes, it doesn't load emails, it won't send emails and every variation in between. I have followed online suggestions to clear the cache and data and yes the problem is solved for no more than 1 day. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again the problem is solved for a day and then back to having the same issues. Woeful!",
            "Whilst I love the features of Ms Outlook, the app has pitfalls. I will receive a notification of a new email, click to review said email and it will be no where to be found. Refresh, refresh, nothing! However, if I go on the desktop web version I will see everything as it is to date. ... This app defeats the purpose of having a mobile service if I always have to draw for my laptop to review emails.",
            "This version of Outlook (mobile, Android) seems appropriately scaled down to suit small screen and \"keyboard\" use and appears to have been optimised for email. Most (or maybe all?) of its original functionality is there, but some features might need a bit of hunting, until you learn how to find them. . Great to be able to use full strength email via phone, with that robust corporate look & feel that Outlook is known for."

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "Any link from any website I choose, it downloads it for 3 minutes, then downloading progress freezes and shows an nonsense error as \"too many errors\"! It's my 8th try and I saw the error everytime. it wasn't like that before, what the hell had happened for app?",
            "Excellent Downloader. But not straightforward and requires setup. So it does takes some getting use to navigating the different methods for downloading and adjusting individual settings (still not 100% proficient myself). Quick Tip: if can't download or fails, open page in desktop mode and try again.",
            "Really nice app. But trying to download files to sd card will make it 70% or even more slower, that is a BIG diffrence, so downloading large files is impossible especially if network gets disrupted it has to be resumed ASAP if not I'll have to start again which cant be over looked with the download rate",
            "This is the app that works. It's free to use, the ads are non intrusive and has more than enough features for everyone. The multi thread support is the reason why everyone needs to use a download manager, it guarantees maximum download speed."

But they keep changing it in ways that actually degrade the customer experience. Click the \"immerse\" button and the wheel spins perpetually. Try the help button and the same thing happens. They are turning what was a good hammer -- a simple, useful tool -- into a bloated, mediocre multitool that does everything -- badly.",

Highly recommend. Now I know 12 languages but I recommend more click to learn languages pages . ( No typing ) to be exact . A very good way to learn languages .",

It is a great way to practice French in the holidays, when I'm not at school as my teachers can set class courses. I've also started learning Italian independently and all the FREE features have definitely helped. You can do so so much and I just wish I could write a longer review because MEMRISE IS INCREDIBLE! So much better than other language apps. ❤️❤",

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "This is a great app to record games with. There are some bugs that still needs to be fixed. 1) If you don't use it for a while the sound doesn't work 2) It lags for a while and it interupts your recording 3) It lags out of some games and just quits on you Those are the bugs that need to be fixed. Otherwise, Great app! Keep up the hard work.",
            "This app does everything it tells you it will do. I just find it very satisfying when your looking for a app and you download it and when you go to try it out its very easy to work it dont trick you into getting it and then u find out you have to pay for it for it to work. This app also dont have any kinks either from what i can tell. I give the person that created it a 5 star rating keep it up and make more apps that works this good.",
            "At first it WAS AMAZING i got hundreds of vids recorded by this app! But one day, I tried it with cutecut and had put the video there, then, the video had shrunk, same with my KineMaster(it happened on the day i downloaded it) I hope that this problem will get fixed immediately. Its one of my only recording app so I hope this will get fixed and work like the old ver. Please fix this! ♥️♥️♥️🇲🇾",
            "Love it! I have played many different \"Sky Car Simulators\" from Google Play. This one is among the best so far out of a dozen or more. There is also one out of ten from \"Unity\" that is close to this in quality. If only the two were to merge, they may be the best on the Market. I have been a pilot for many years in Alaska. This flying App is very realistic with the added benefit of what flying a real Sky Car may be like. There are some bugs in this one, yet hail to the developers!",
            "It's an excellent recorder. You can record in 2k at up to 60fps, which is fenomenal! My only issue is the limited amount of apps which support internal audio only. I really hate recording with background noise, and is not convenient unless you need to record your voice, which is something I'm not planning to do. I'm not sure if the apps themselves need to allow this somehow or the recorder simply can't do it now, but maybe with an update (I hope this is the case). It's great nonetheless!"

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

And then, today, I find that most of the data for this and previous years has suddenly disappeared (it was there yesterday). Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",
            "This had been one of the most useful apps I ever used. But for the last several weeks it is not responding. I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",
            "Stopped working. I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",
            "Terrible! Google maps has been my go to for years on every phone I've had now over the past week the maps won't load the addresses and won't give directions. I have uninstalled then reinstalled for under a minute temporary fix then it does it all over again. I can't get any numbers or find my way unless I zoom into the map and follow my blue icon showing where I am. If I didn't know how to read maps ill be f***ed. This is bad."

WhatsApp uses your phone&#39;s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>WHY USE WHATSAPP:<br><br>• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone&#39;s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don&#39;t have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.<br><br>• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.<br><br>• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they&#39;re in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone&#39;s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan&#39;s voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can&#39;t access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).<br><br>• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.<br><br>• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer&#39;s browser.<br><br>• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There&#39;s no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*<br><br>• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone&#39;s existing address book.<br><br>• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you&#39;re always logged in so you don&#39;t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you&#39;re logged in or logged out.<br><br>• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there&#39;s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.<br><br>• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.<br><br>• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!<br><br>*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------- <br>We&#39;re always excited to hear from you!

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",

It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

I'll open the app and it will show the beginning page and it then just goes back to the home screen of my tablet. I'm really disappointed.

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Hello, Twitch Team! Thank you so much for making this App. I really enjoy watching people play games like Among Us and MTG Arena. Lately though I've been having issue while watching a stream. Sometime it would just freeze and then I'll have to close the app and open it again just so I could resume watching the stream. I know it's not that much but sometimes I miss things in the stream. My phone is kinda old. Is it possible that my phone is at fault at this one? Thank you and bless you all!",
            "Trash app lol, certain games like CSGO are full of scam streamers, which they do nothing about, and sometimes they even ban the real streamer while the fake ones keep roaming with thousands of viewers scamming people. On top of that the sound just randomly starts breaking, it just becomes robotic from nowhere on PC only way to fix it is refreshing. On top of THAT on PC the stream will randomly freeze and u have to pause and reload to make it start playing again. The only way i could solve this was with an alternateplayer. Disgraceful realy, and these issues have been going on for over a year at least, i lost count. The only reason i still watch is coz all my favorite streamers are on the platform. Everything else about the platform except the emotes and the streamer communities is absolutely terrible. On TOP of that they are trying to implement ads in the middle of the streams, amazing to get an ad when an epic moment is about to happen :). Guess i should buy amazon prime in my country which would give me 0 benefit since they dont even ship here. Guess it's time to quit or see how it goes :)",
            "Its really good and simple to understand and use, but there's one big problem. Everytime I start watching a stream there's a 30 second ad, which is really annoying since you can't skip it either. If you could either ad a skip button or put shorter ads, like 5 second ads. If you could fix this, then I'll change my rating to 5 stars :)",
            "Good app - there are a few things that could be better but overall all, if you are used to using Twitch on the pc, you know what you are getting here. I have seen some people complaining about the lack of quality options and the presence of adverts but this depends who you are watching and the ads disappear if you are stubbed so don't worry about these points.",
            "I honestly love this app, it's a great way to communicate with your favourite streamers. But I have one problem. I want to change my username but I haven't verified my email yet. so I tried to numerous times but it keeps on saying something has gone wrong. I uninstalled the app and done everything I could but it said the same thing, and I was even putting in the right email address. Please fix this if you can!! Overall this app is great 👍"

I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh.

One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

Most items are presale with shipping dates months away & it's hard to keep track when you have multiple orders!

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "Update: I was able to refresh the license through the Play Store settings. After uninstalling on my old phone it will not let me use the \"pro\" version on my new phone. The subscription renewed last May for the year, but constantly tries to get me to upgrade and pay again from with the app. It's stupid that I can't download a \"pro\" version from the app store, and forced to pay again from within the app. Very deceptive.",
            "Cant get the app to work Edit: Cant get the app to work. When I click \"Analyze\" it takes me back to \"Home Screen\". I click de app again, I get a message that says \"App keeps closing\". Below that there are two options. 1. App info. 2. Close app. And that`s it. I have this app in another Android tablet and works fine. But it won't work on this new Galaxy tab S5e Android tablet.",
            "It does great things for the performance of the phone. In my opinion it doesn't need to look flashy, isn't that defeating the purpose of lowering ram usage, lol.",
            "Down loaded it. Opened it. Get a prompt asking me to turn a switch on. I would if I had the faintest idea how to access/find the switch. No link, no instructions and after trying to activate every potential icon I still don't get any further forward. Another example of a program relying on people already knowing how to work it. But for me, just a waste of memory space. I get faster and better results from just rebooting.",
            "I use to use CCleaner years ago when I was in the computer repair field. When I found out CCleaner was available on Android naturally I was intrigued. After using it for well over a month I found CCleaner to be utterly useless. #1. It doesn't do anything my phone doesn't already do. #2. The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps. Low and behold it was drastically off."

            "I don't have any issue with the apps, the problem is in my country crunchyroll only have 5 good/kinda famous series, and only 1 series that only available on crunchyroll. Is not worth it $11/months for premium. I don't know where i need to tell this. If I'm not wrong crunchyroll promise in 2014, they want to make all anime available in my country. In reality, until now maybe less than 10% anime available in my country compare to U.S crunchyroll",
            "Amazing app, there's loads of anime to choose from. But there's WAY too many adverts. I feel like I only get to watch half of the episode, because the rest is advertising different series.",
            "I love the app and the selection, but I think the app would benefit from a request board of some sort where people can go once a week or something like that to request a new anime they want to watch, instead of contacting you through social media or the help center. Other than this feature I do love the selection and the app and I hope you all are doing well.",
            "The app was never that functional to begin with, but recently became completely unusable. I have high speed internet, but I can't watch a single episode without buffering every 15 sec and being automatically switched to low quality. Rest of my streaming apps are fine. Casting to Chromecast was bad to begin with: it would disconnect regularly or refuse to sync, but now the video quality makes it impossible to watch on a larger screen. A video streaming service that can't stream video. Incredible.",
            "This app is really good never really had a problem with it till now, everytime I tried to watch something it always says that it can't connect to crunchyroll. My internet is high speed it has nothing to do with it, i've tried resetting everything from my phone to reinstalling the app but it always says that. I really hope I can get some help to fix this problem."

When I also understood that review your edits and use the brush for Double Exposure, I was so stoked because the only problem I had with this app was that the image does not get inside properly and when I try to darken the added image, the 1st one gets lighter and then gets beneath.

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

I wanted to comment on a discussion but I'm not going to download an app to do it when a web browser should work perfectly. Such sites just want your personal info so they can sell it for ad revenue.",
            "The performance and responsiveness in the messages section needs improvement. Feels very sluggish, and having to pull down to refresh for new messages doesn't help the situation. It just doesn't feel intuitive. I also think the LFG tab should be the first or second tab a user can select. I think it's the main reason people use the app, so please don't hide it at the end. Love the app otherwise!",
            "Great app I use it to find teammates and upload R6 clips and theres no problems I find messaging people a bit difficul at times but thats the only problem",
            "I love the app. But there are some problems. Mootified is quite an undefined award and there have been a rise of \"I am a gamer girl\" quotes or \"gamer girls join me\" kind of thing. Apart from that, it's ok. Yours sincerely, (yes that is my name, [blank])",
            "It's mostly little kids on there. Most of the games featured are free to play titles so the community is all children who have no money for buying games."

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

            "They actually did a pretty good job of adapting it to the smaller screen on the phone. The puzzle is done in sections. You can choose the number of pieces, turn rotation on or off and change the scale. I LOVE the background music by Ruslan Gumbatov! There are daily puzzles and missions but I don't bother with those, I play it to relax, not to collect rewards.",
            "I've loved this app for a long time now and it's one of the few that I even bought! **Edit**Oct 17 (dropped to 3 stars) I'm disappointed in the new layout of the daily and My Puzzle packs. I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",
            "Your app has sucked since the beginning of september, cant play daily puzzle. Fix it. Update new fix didn't work. Still can't play daily puzzle. Game freezes when you try. You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle. And now i lost all puzzles i had bought"

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please? Thank you.",

Often doesn't record audio, images, videos and statuses, even if notifications are on and downloading media is fully on(wi-fi and mobile data). In play market, there's only one app that records (supposed to record and save) all deleted messages, and that's WAMR.(4 stars) 10/16/2020: It can't store data on sd card...(2 stars)",
            "Everything works fab !!! The only thing which needs to be fixed is : 1. Why does it recover the media which i deleted myself from gallery. 2. It just shows the statuses which i opened rather than showing all the statuses. 3. Lastly in the status section categorize it as photos & videos. Plz fix this, it will surely rock the app...",
            "Well the app is great. But sometimes it fails to recover media even when it is fully downloaded. And now it doesn't work because I moved the contents of WhatsApp to SD card. Please fix this error. Make it so that it can still show media when it is being downloaded to SD. Otherwise it is awesome.",
            "It should be able to capture those messages and media which I haven't seen or opened. Suppose I miss a message while I am sleeping, I should be able to get those messages even when the sender has deleted it.. Otherwise it works relly perfect. Thank you for all your hard work.",
            "It is very useful in the beginning but gradullay it cannot work properly the name we cannot saved in our contact he/she sent a message to whatsapp or any other medias if they delete the message we cannot see that I cannot get the notification i enable the notification i cant get it But sometimes it is very useful app to me I suggest to everyone in this app Thankyou"

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "One of the Best apps for chatting and texting. I got a lot of my old friend together because of discord. The only thing that needs fixing is The Voice Calls, this happens to me sometimes. I will be in a voice chat for a few minutes, or hours. Suddenly, it will stop transmitting my Voice. Other times. It will kick me out of the call completely, but discord is great overran. And it usually is ok with calls!",
            "Oh my god this update is awesome! It even removed the bug for which I put a 2 star rating. I'm really sorry developers I didn't tell you the problem, I didn't see your reply! I kept getting kicked out of Discord after talking to some friends of mine and this happened quite often. But now downloading it after a long time it seems to have been gone! You did a great job, keep it up!! This app will be a huge success :))))",
            "Very convenient for finding large communities around any subject. I love being able to talk with my friends in a small group chat, or in a large server with fun bots. The premium features are certainly worth it for anyone that spends a majority of their time within the app. However, all premium features are a monthly, or yearly payment. This is not very convenient for those who don't have a steady source of income. There should be an option to get minimum parts of premium for a single payment.",
            "Most of the times it doesn't work without headphones, however if I use it in another smartphone it does work. Something that I've experienced is that while you're in a call, it mutes or something like that, so I have to get out of the call and get in again, this \"mute\" happens while I'm not touching the phone and quitting the call is the only solution i've found",
            "Hello. Whenever I have discord open (browser or app), I completely lag out of games and my discord client, and it causes my web browser to stop responding. Without discord open, I never experience lag. Also, while in both browser or app, I'll suddenly be completely unable to speak in discord, but can hear everything that other people are saying. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm dying for a fix. I love discord, but it's been basically unusable for the last couple weeks."

For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage.

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I was working perfectly until yesterday. I opened it this morning to send some stuff but the message still isn't delivered. It doesn't work on both devices i used it on. I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

Maybe you could fetch the best-fit-pic from a free image repository, like Anki or YouGlish are doing. But packing words in 40 words packages and assigning pics manually [as it sounds from your comment] is too much work and will affect the quality of the content. I'm only talking about the lock-screen options, But I like the app, it is well done and beneficial.",

Other than that keep clean is a great app, except for the inconvenience part of it, that's why I only gave four stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐❌",

Its not difficult and doesn't pester you with ads! It also doesn't ask you to rate it as much as other apps do! I recommend this app its simple to use! I would surely be using this for a while!",
            "SO GOOD!!! I never had any problems with removing a background. Anyone saying it's hard either doesn't know how to use or lying. Of course it's not like easy easy. There are times where u need to consentrate and need to be precise but it's not that hard. Good for youtubers or people that makes artworks. No more where am I even drawing? Or I'm not a professional person who has been training precision for years. Anyone can do it if u take time and watch tutorials",
            "Soooooo This app is really good! It works perfectly but... It's pretty hard to get rid of you extras left when you use the auto fill. I know there is a option to make it get rid of that but it's not the best. 5 is really bad becuase it can get rid of some of the picture. This app still is good and I still love it for editing. It is great with IBIS paint. Is great! :D",
            "SO GOOD!, its doesn't show as many ads as other apps!!! I suggest using this. and it doesn't SAY TO RATE IT ALL THE TIME ISNT THAT GREAT?. it's so easy to use to! it's so helpful with Youtubers or Instagram fanpages like me! I make themes and this helps so much I suggest using the magic eraser cause it gets all the spots you dont want!!! keep up the hood work byee!!!",
            "Ok, after I use this app for several times, I have found that this app is very helpful in my digital work. To create good photo for my product no matter how bad the background is. Thanks. But sometimes I found it hard to do clear the background to make it as good as it seen ."

Perhaps an improvement on when you're asked to check if you are human will respond to your captcha direct will make it better because often times when you click on continue it takes a different direction and you have to struggle to cancel it in order to get what you want you go back and do it carefully otherwise is prone to take you else where you never intended.",

Mb increased and much faster than uc browser and same as uc browser that's why I loved it and real issue is in low end phones it will lag as same as uc browser and it's good for mid- range and high end phones................................................................... Dear team thank you for this updates, no doubt it's the best browser for phone right now and I'll recomend my friends to download uc mini."

            "It is a good game but weapons are way too costly. You had to do the side tasks endlessly in order to purchase the new weapon (that is if you don't purchase the in-game currency via real money). Gameplay and maps and all other things are good.",
            "this game is very good i liked it. the graphics are supper good the weapons are good but some of them are far too expensive and why cant u just keep all the weapons equiped so that if you really need the weapons you can just switch them",

            "great game... ads only play when you choose to... but when you reach the maximum skill level your combat level will be stuck as well... but i wonder why is that on the skirmish game there are players with higher combat levels, how could they still upgrade their combat level? and what is the purpose of getting more cash when we can't use it anymore after reaching the max skill level?",
            "This is the best offline free game I have ever played. I would have given it a 5 stars but there are issues with the game. 1. Skill cards need to be fixed where we can continue to upgrade them, they max out at level 16. Without skill card upgrade your combat score does not increase. You have also done away with being able to use cash, you need to create another way we can use cash. Also, more chapters please, I finished the new one in 2 days, now what? You have a great product, you must improve",
            "Gameplay is fun and excellent apart from you cannot go back to a missed target which I find odd and irritating. The reason for 3 star rating and uninstalling the app is the persistent pressure to buy stuff like upgrades. Pay2win is usually associated with multiplayer games, in a single player game it just seems rediculous. Either sell the game for a reasonable price or if you feel the need to sell what should be achieved in the game as part of the game, have a store where players can buy stuff.",
            "Wow I am impressed. Visually it looks great and I feel it handles very well. Most shooting games aren't the easiest to control. But this one works. All you do it aim and shoot, so you do loose freedom to run around but the gameplay and graphics make up for it. It's worth a try for anyone into shooters. Will play it through and leave edited review.",
            "Good game and quite addictive. Initially I thought it is pay to win as it got a bit hard after the first few plays, but after that, smooth sailing. You can finish it easy, fast and fun as F2P, but it's too short! Also, after finishing all missions, I still have to unlock half the characters/guns, but there's no point in that as multiplayer isn't rewarding enough and missions are too short and unengaging the 2nd time.

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Overall not a terrible app. has good films and shows on it. One thing that keeps on annoying me is that every time I open the app it reminds me about the profiles feature even tho I have already set up a profile on it. Also what's with the adverts, I am already paying £10 a month I don't want adverts. I get that you are promoting your new shows but put them at the end so when I exit the show give me a recommendation for a new show to watch. I know I can skip the adverts but it's just annoying.",
            "Generally first rate. The apps weak point is with no (or a weak) WiFi signal. Then when you go to play a previously downloaded show, you may get a license error. The license errors come in groups. Connecting to WiFi doesn't fix the problem. Deleting and re-dowloading the show will fix the problem. Sometimes it fixes a group of them.",
            "Almost great. No way to rate content. Unfortunately a lot of content is not available in original language. In Switzerland we have German, French and Italian as major languages so it is hit and miss if a film or show is in a language you speak even if it was originally made in English. Bohemian Rhapsody is only available in Italian, Electric Dreams only in German. Curiously Buffy the vampire slayer is only available in English. Netflix has original plus German, French and often Italian.",
            "The good things about prime video is it is a good deal for a lot of perks. The prime video library is really good too. Now the bad things The app is buggy at times. Sometimes when I close the player it returns to episode menu but is stuck there unless I go back to homepage The video player opens in seperate window and when I'm switching applications I can't tell which prime video window to select in recent apps window. The windows app is even worse, downloads expire as soon as I download them.",
            "It's an app deserving of 5 star rating all right. But this is an updated review because I am unable to stream in full HD on my LG G8x. I've checked the phone just to be sure and it supports Widevine L1 plus all other streaming services like Netflix are able to play HD content on my phone except this app. Please fix this. It's a frustrating experience and no one is even responding to my emails or feedback"

Doesn't compketely replace the actosr face to resemble your face. Some of the clips seem like they do not change a bit. Is there a way to better the consistency of the refacing? If so, then I would give the app a 5 star rating. Thank you",

            "Fun app but minus 1 star for two reasons... 1. Kept me up all night. Had I paid for the full version, I could have been sleeping most of the night but I had to support the app by watching 30 second ads before each reface. 2. I get the ads but maybe not before each reface, maybe every other one. At least change the ads up a little. Most of the time you're watching the same ad like that's going to make me buy the product.

EDIT- After a while of using this player, I just bought Premium because I love this app that much. And I mean you don't really need premium to use this app, so people, please try this app. It'll be worth it.",

Add the \"select subtitle\" next to the night mode on the screen. double tap skip is very useful. create \"second to seek for jump action\", \"10 second\" for skip is very limited. Change the brightness and volume numbers of 1-10 to 1-100. Add the video name to display in playback section. Thanks.",

            "It's a good game, but only if you want to spam cards, been on this game for a couple years now. I've come and gone and they still have things that make it near impossible for non pay to win players to progress. If you want to progress you need to get powerful gear, a good way to do that is events. An event that requires a 300k gear score will one shot people with a 1m gear score. If your not looking to progress and just want to chill with random people, it's a good game to be on.",
            "The fact that I've been playing this game for ever since like four years ago and they still haven't fixed the neverending \"Now Loading\" screen is just... honestly, disappointing. You're forced to exit the game every two or three quests you do and the devs haven't done anything to change that. I came back for the sake of nostalgia but it's let me down once again. Annoying.",
            "The general overall experience of the game is good. Recent updates have however caused regular issues in game such as freezing and dodgy connections (which yes u have tested and aren't just my signal). The company clearly puts a lot of thought into new things to add to the game, I just feel they need to address bugs more because since the last lot were added, it's been months with no change, yet loads of new content for them to make money. Clearly their priority is money and nothing else",
            "Honestly, I fell in love with the game a few years back. I still enjoy it to a certain degree, but some things have been bugging me: 1. There are some minor glitches like people or monsters not loading. While it seems innocent, it becomes really inconvinient for Guild Battles and stuff. 2. Even though the devs tried to solve the issue, it's still an issue. The stronger the monsters, the more broken it is. Unisoning in Guild Battles is still broken as such. Please continue to resolve the issue!",
            "The game is pretty nice. The customization feels great and streamlined; easy to learn. One critique is that with more money, you can easily progress faster than everyone around you, akin to the problem Clash of Clans has. The gameplay feels nice and natural; along with the fun guild battle system. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to customize the party you quest with. I.E. Choosing whether or not to allow other CPU's to come with you. Overall, great game, fun time."

They take FOREVER to load (sometimes they don't load at all) and if the Pin isn't fully loaded it won't let me save it to my boards. Also, why can't I search for other people's boards anymore?? Please bring that feature back!",
            "I love this app. It is exceptionally handy, simple to use and much more. It has most of the topics ranging from celebrities, Do It Yourself (D.I.Y) , and many many more. It also helps me to pin the photos, create new boards, looking for new ideas and many more. Thanks for your kindness, helpfulness and keep it interesting. So, keep on improving. I will be looking forward to see many more topics. As I always replying politely, stay home, stay safe and have a great time.",
            "This app has been great in so many ways and I love it. But lately the app keeps crashing. It doesn't stay open for more than 2 seconds and as someone else mentioned, it does stay open in the background. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I switched my cell off and on again. Cleared cache and even did a deep scan of my phone. But nothing seems to be working. Hope the issue gets resolved quickly.",
            "This app was pretty good. I've been using it for 2 years. But lately the app has been crashing very much. It does stays open for more than 2-3 second. Also when i am using any other apps then suddenly a thing pops out saying \"Unfortunately, pinterest has stopped\" . I have seen that others are also facing this same problem. If you can then please repair it asap.",
            "Idk what the hell is going on, but it will go from allowing you to scroll to not allowing anything but moving up and down the pin. You have to back out of the pin you're on, which is possibly really are far down or closer to where the LAST time it stopped letting you scroll, and have to go all the way to the pin you were on. THEN it'll stop scrolling like three pins. Or five. And it needs to be fixed before I change my review. Even updating it didn't fix the issue, if anything it got worse."
