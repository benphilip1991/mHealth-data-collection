        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints — especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths — especially in the morning — help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n✅ arthritis ✅\r\n✅ rheumatoid arthritis ✅\r\n✅ arthritis in hands ✅\r\n✅ arthritis pain relief ✅",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "This app was my favorite one at a time it was relaxing and makes me happy but now it is a very bad app . Coz till fifth level we sell ice creams in a motorcycle like thing but when we finish the fifth level it says that the road is rocky so we should pay an amount and get a big van to sell the ice cream. And if we look other characters shop and sell ice creams like blueberry muffins shop . They are closed we should complete all levels of the strawberry shortcake's shop and then get them .",
            "My kids like the strawberry shortcake games and I am even happy to pay for the DLC which I did for this. Unfortunately its locked to my account so even though the kids share a tablet as they have their own accounts. I dont want to pay for everything twice so I'm not buying any more DLC.",
            "It is fun...but you only get 4 levels for free which is pretty dissapointing. There are not many things for free.",
            "The game is a 5 star but I gave it 3 Stars because you have to pay for the game and I cant complete it now sorry if you fix the game then I will give it 5 stars but until then it stays as a 3 star game sorry (just my opinion by the way)",
            "It was a complete 5 star experience, simple and easy to learn building up sequences to fulfill the orders. The issue is without paying the game can not be completed, which is still ok as the effort of development deserves the money, but today we realized the already completed demo regions can not be played for free anymore... This was an awful experience, the price is fair but this action made it considerable to pay.."

            "I paid for this application but it gives me headache. When i started to locate my husband, it worked just for a day or two but now, it doesn't work anymore. Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

            "I am no video editor but i wanted a few edits so i went searching for an app. I downloaded this one due to the advertisement that it's free to use. I edited a video, loved the video, tried to download, and it took me straight to a screen to pay a monthly/weekly/yearly subscription. I can't download the video without it. \"Best free pro video editing app\". At least it's easy to use...",
            "The upgrades have ruined this app. When you export a video 90% of the screens are black. The audio is choppy and it sounds like a skipped record. The only way you can get it to export properly is with a 360 and then everything is fuzzy. I paid to have the watermark removed and it was for nothing because I can't get the video to upload!!!",
            "What the hell Filmora!? I had problem with the format of my videos and couldn't upload them on youtube if I don't sacrifice the quality and I'm still waiting for an answer for this problem and now I have problem with recording an voicever! What is happening? Why you are trying to sabotage my work? I paid for the watermark but don't expect me to buy the pro package. So disappointed! Thank you for ruining my work!",
            "I'm very disappointed with the experience on Android ... this app is amazing and full of option... but...the application lag constantly, doesn't matter what recording I use (60 or 30 Fram) The application works properly on Apple products and when i try to use it on Android (Galaxy Z Fold 2) its lagging. I can't use any of my videos ... And I paid every months for it...",
            "I love your app because of several reasons first - When we complete the editing of any video there is no watermark in the video Second - there are many video editing options even we didn't join the premium that's awesome!! Third - it has been the best video editing app when It goes for a update so these are all things I love (not like) (love is better than like ) about this app 👍👍👍"

For example, if I use my double electric breast pump for 20 minutes to pump both breast, I have to increase the pumping time to 40 minutes which is not accurate. It is not programmed well in this area. The menu to see the history is not user friendly...it's harder to quickly navigate, especially when a current activity is happening. Sometimes, it finishes the activity.",

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",
            "This game is overall satisfying but the controls are clunky. I wish that you could decorate your cake but I like this game. And why is this PEGI 18!!!",

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

Now we go to play and everything has to be bought. She is so upset. There was no mention of a trial period. I was going to buy her some packs as a birthday surprise but if this is the way the company does business I will spend my money elsewhere. I would rate lower than 1 if I could.",
            "It is fun...but you only get to make smoothies for free which is pretty dissapointing. You can make smoothies with different ingredients but there are only 2-3 decorations that you can add for free.",
            "To people who are saying that this app is a scam it is not I have had this app for ages and nothing is wrong with it so them people saying \"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PAY FOR STUFF\" say that all you like because I had it longer then you and its a good game I recommend you listen to this👉 this game is not a rip off its a good game for your kids my kids play it and so do I.I might have a addiction but it's better than saying mean stuff about it and the creater.go away haters.",
            "I like this game but I have two reasons why I hate this game reason number one the adds like how annoying and reason twolike every time I try to unlock something I have to pay like how annoying and for example oh I want a cake pop and I how to pay $9 for straws and cake pops like these people are crazy and make me spend so many dollars over this dumb stuff like how annoying these people are crazy",
            "I always look at the comments before I download the game and when I looked at the comments some of the said DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME because they say you have to PAY MONEY to get the dishes and all the other things so the people who maked this game are reading please upgrade it but I am sorry to say but this game officially SUCKS sorry :("

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "I gave you only one star because I liked it very little. The problem is that I am a kid and and I can't buy stuff. Your other games are like that too. It is showing that I need to make a blue Very Berry Shortcake but blue is locked. Fix it 😡😡😡😡",
            "Honestly i realy like this game , but i have to buy so PLEASE MAKE IT FAIR . I just dont want to wast my money ok..",
            "Honestly, its pretty fun. But, we barley get options for anything. I really do think that maybe 1 or 2 more cake options should be free, along with more decorations, food dye, and utensils.",
            "Only one cake is unlocked. All the others are locked and you have to pay for each one. One is currently £2.99 and another one is £9.99. Seems like a really lovely app and i wouldn't mind paying if it was for all for £9.99."

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

            "It was one of the the best app among the others few years back. Used it for my pregnancy 3 years ago. Now for my second pregnancy downloaded it and all could see is unwanted upgrading ads ,every article i open requires a premium upgrade. Looks like all it cares about is how to make money.its super super annoying. Uninstalling it.",
            "Kinda hard to navigate and constantly pulling up the premium ads. Deleted it ultimately because every time i tried to read about my week; i was confounded by stories of miscarriage that triggered my anxiety over previous loss and got me scared and worried. I started not using it and then deleted over that.",
            "I love this app, and truly feel that the premium option is worth it. Many people are quick to dismiss paid for apps, but they forget the team behind the platform, which lead me through when I didn't want to conceive, to now - half way through my pregnancy. I get excited to check my daily update on my pregnancy journey: supported by great articles relating to every single day of pregnancy, and a community to chat with, along with smart analysis. Thanks Glow, keep up the great work!",
            "This is a pretty good app for being free besides all the ads to upgrade. I can log things I do like water intake, if I take my prenatal, how much sleep I get, etc. It also gives updates about my baby and what stage he/she is in and each week compares its size to food 😄 I like that there are articles I can read and there are other people in the same stage at me on this so it's like we're all in this together ❤"

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things.

            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

        "description": "We put a lot of impact on our joints over the years. Eventually they start to show the signs of wear and tear. With age, arthritis can cause the joints in our knees, hands, wrists, and feet to become stiff and sore.\r\n\r\nArthritis also affects the vertebrae in our neck, which get worn down from years of supporting our head. After age 60, more than 85 percent of people have arthritis in their neck, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).\r\n\r\nIf your neck is sore, see a doctor to find out exactly what’s causing your pain. You can visit your family doctor or see a specialist like an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or osteopathic doctor. Your doctor can also advise you on therapies to help relieve the pain such as postural changes, physical therapy, yoga, or Pilates. And your doctor may recommend pain relieving medication or steroid injections.\r\n\r\nYou can also try basic exercises at home. Though you might be tempted to keep your neck still when it hurts, staying immobile will only increase the stiffness. It will also cause you to lose even more movement. Stretching and strengthening exercises will help keep your neck limber and reduce your arthritis pain.\r\n\r\nHere are a few exercises you can try for relieving neck arthritis. Remember to move gently and smoothly through each exercise. Never make any sudden movements or jerk your neck. Twisting and turning your neck is done in the neck rotation exercise.

With age, arthritis can cause the joints in our knees, hands, wrists, and feet to become stiff and sore.<br><br>Arthritis also affects the vertebrae in our neck, which get worn down from years of supporting our head. After age 60, more than 85 percent of people have arthritis in their neck, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).<br><br>If your neck is sore, see a doctor to find out exactly what’s causing your pain. You can visit your family doctor or see a specialist like an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or osteopathic doctor. Your doctor can also advise you on therapies to help relieve the pain such as postural changes, physical therapy, yoga, or Pilates. And your doctor may recommend pain relieving medication or steroid injections.<br><br>You can also try basic exercises at home. Though you might be tempted to keep your neck still when it hurts, staying immobile will only increase the stiffness. It will also cause you to lose even more movement. Stretching and strengthening exercises will help keep your neck limber and reduce your arthritis pain.<br><br>Here are a few exercises you can try for relieving neck arthritis. Remember to move gently and smoothly through each exercise. Never make any sudden movements or jerk your neck. Twisting and turning your neck is done in the neck rotation exercise. Also, stop if any exercise increases your neck pain.",

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "I like the game but when you're on the battlefield some particular players have bugged the game especially from the US and each time you play with them it always say weak connection and they end up faster than you are in battle giving them the upper hand please fix this issue, has happened to me more than 4 times now and it's pissing me off, once that is corrected then I will consider a higher rating for it",
            "This used to be one of the most innovative fighting games ever to be on mobile. Also it used to be my favorite game to play only about 6 months ago or less. But Now? Its pretty much a dead game. It's pay to play, it lags at the worst moments in battles even if you're playing RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR ROUTER! Please whatever you do, do not download this game. Its no longer worth it. Don't say i didn't warn you.",
            "The game was pretty fun but it sucks in so many parts its always says reconnect even you have excellent connection, especially if you're in an important battles like in battlefield, arcade, etc... Always when You're about to win it suddenly says reconnect which is very frustrating coz instead of ranking up suddenly you lost the rank.",
            "Nice game good graphics and easy controls. But only thing is unlocking champions seems too difficult and upgrading also. But other than that i love this game."

It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "I've been using Gmail for years and have always been happy. The last few days I have not been able to send out emails from my android tablet, they sit in que for days. My android cell phone had an update recently, the app icon has changed and e mail works fine from my phone but not my tablet. I've looked for an update but nothing so far. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail.",
            "Please make a simple way to delete in bulk. Ie, create a check-box to select multiple email at once. (Be sure to advise everyone that they'll have to change sync settings in all Google apps and devices. (Make that easy to do as well!) Or perhaps create a simpler way to check all settings that need apply. *Ease of access is key* It's annoying and is the reason I had to create 25 different Gmail accounts bc we don't have money to purchase any extra storage features. Please and thanks!",
            "Edit: the update got a new logo and now my emails take 30 minutes or more to send. Nice. Very nice. 🙄 This app is very behind compared to other apps. Where is the \"select all\" option? This app will only work with its limited features for those who dont have a lot of emails.For someone like me this isnt a possibility so this will no longer be my main emailing app.",
            "Just like all of Google's other products, this too does not work as expected. All of Google's products are failing lately. I have emails sitting there waiting to be read, but I rarely get a notification of them. And I am talking about the emails in my inbox, not the ads or subscription emails. That part of gmail actually still works quite well with those being separated into separate folders. I'm looking for apps that replace all of Google's apos... might even consider (gasp!) Apple's iPhone!",
            "Updates? Practically every other day but out of 15 emails I had today not one was in primary list. Every day I move them between primary; updates and promotions and still not one in the right place. You work on it every day but as far as I can see not one useful thing comes out of it. Oh yeah!! Beautiful new logo (how long did you work on it?) We really needed that?!?!"

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "This game is insanely good!! I have an underaged account, which is very annoying because it blocks some features, but it is still the BEST game I have ever played!! The graphics are very good and the gameplay is even better! All these people that say that it is PTP (Pay To Play) are WRONG!! I am at the max level and am very good, I have never payed anything! Hope anybody who plays this game enjoys it! Thank you very much EA for making such an amazing game!",
            "I love this game. I don't spend and still enjoy it, although it is a grind, so don't expect any quick progression without spending. My one suggestion would be to have a randomized pull in the beginning that gives you a random but guaranteed character. Doesn't have to be anyone amazing. 1 or 2 star character that then makes your experience of the game unique. I know you can try and pull from a chromium card but no guarantees and gems are too valuable as f2p.",
            "The game goes out of its way to ensure you're not making any decent progress without spending huge amounts. In the first 3 1/2 years of the game, new content and characters were frequent, though in the past year or so this has seen a rapid decline. Game modes have grown stale and repetitive. Any new characters have ridiculous requirements to obtain them, we are talking 6 month to a year to unlock. The game lacks balance, leveling up/gearing characters is an endless grind with little reward.",
            "Collect Star wars characters, what more can I say. Have had the game over 2 years now and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The game has its ups and downs, and of course there is a pay to win element, but it's in no way essential. Metas change fairly regularly and all eras of star wars are given their fair share of attention. The game also offers a great variety of game modes: Single player PVE, guild based PVE, single player PVP and guild based PVP. A fan of star wars must have this game.",
            "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF RIP OFFS. Just ok. Starts out fun, but then the game becomes total pay for play. The prices they ask are ridiculous. Supply drops r a joke since 99% of what you get, is fairly useless. No really special stuff gets dropped and updating characters & ships, unless you're willing to drop serious coin - isn't happening. The new characters are impossible to get without $. Don't bother trying to contact the developers - you'll never get an answer."

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "There are so many ads. And there a impossible levels so that you have to watch ads manually to skip the level. They also need to add more stages because once you get far enough into the game you just repeat previous levels. I have seen every level at least 3 times each. But the overall gameplay and idea is amazing, and the repeating levels dont bother me much, which is why i am 2000 levels into the game. 3/5",
            "TOO MANY ADS. I like the gameplay but an ad every 10 secs (some even un-skippable) kind of breaks the flow and makes a good game disengaging. I think it would be better to decrease the frequency of the advertisements and let the user immerse more in the game than the advertisements...",

            "Honestly no idea why- but ive been experiencing so many problems with recent updates. Ive been working on this edit and all the transitions are extremely buggy- they won't even transition smoothly, it just cuts off. At first i didn't mind it because it wasn't too noticeable. But now its every single transition that won't come out smooth. Literally trying to do anything on this app either crashes the whole app or just messes up transitions.",
            "It had been working fine just the videos came out laggy all the time. Today i had spent an hour working on a video and the app just closed, everytime i went back in it would ask if i would like to continue editing and i clicked resume but then it would just close again. After a few times didnt even give the option to resume anymore and now i basically lost an hour of my life because of bugs.",
            "So I loved this app and I still do but there is one problem. I had this app signed into my old phone so when I got my new phone I tried so many times to log in but it keeps saying \"Account already registered\" So I have to be as a guest but I really wanna go on funimate as my account. Please help me log back into funimate.",
            "Honestly, super good! It's given me quite inspiration to do more things! The effects, filters are nice, and so is just everything in all. The reason I gave a star off, though, is because of the \"Locked\" items that can only be given through following FM on different platforms, but all in all a good software!",
            "My experience was just horrible I had to buy pro to get my edit which I spent hours on. If it would only come to that why wouldn't yall mention that in the beginning? I never got my edit and it took a lot of time to make. I'm upset. I'm never using this app again nor am I recommending it to anyone. Thank you have a good day. I hope this problem can be fixed."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",

The release notes don't reveal this cut (nor the removal of the offline dictionary as a free feature), so the bait and switch just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",
            "Endless problems with this app, after the recent update app crashes the moment I opened it. PLUS. Offline dictionary is utter useless. I cant search for anything when I'm offline. I don't even know the download progress of my offline dictionary. I regret paying for this app. I've been forcing myself to use this cause I paid for it but now this is way too much.",
            "EDIT I absolutely love the new layout, it's so well designed that I'm fine with this app not having a dark mode. It's a overall a great app otherwise I wouldn't pay for all the bells and whistles, however its missing a dark/black theme, if it had that it would be the perfect dictionary app 👌😎. (Thanks for taking your time to read this)",
            "Just updated, now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't respond to any touch. Now crashing. Now it works a little bit before crashing. All my recents and searches are gone. This is frustrating, don't mess with my recents list.",
            "Best dictionary and dictionary app ever. The latest redesign is beautiful, the offline dictionary download has been fixed, but it seems the speed of the app when showing the definition, even after the offline dictionary is downloaded, is considerably slower than the previous version."

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "Google Back Ups doesn't work at all. I Definitely had it on! I lost all my contact when my screen broke. My last back up was way back in April. And I've barely use 2% of my storage. I tried everything. But with a broken screen, there was just no way for me to back up my phone or retrieve my contacts from my phone.",
            "I love using this app for contact back up only thing is I just got a new phone and added a new contact to device. The app didn't back it up automatically so I had to add it manually. When I assigned a number to speed dial my phone shows multiple numbers for the same person. Most of which were the samw number. I'd love for the app to tell me if there are miultiple numbers for contacts on my phone and have the app merge the contacts on my phone.",
            "I've been using Google Contacts on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra. Contacts just disappear! Where are they going? This problem Google, has been ongoing now for awhile. The same with Google Mesaages. Problems with messages not sending unless you go into Messages to turn Chat off. What the heck?? Who is ruining these Google Apps?? My Pixelbook with Google Contacts as defult, the same contact as on my Samsung, just disappears...",
            "Syncing works fine for me. However I'm annoyed that I can't view a contact's details beyond name and photo without using the \"edit\" function. I can't be the only person out there who occasionally needs to look at a contact's mailing address. To do this from the contact detail screen you must use the \"edit\" button. So weird.",
            "It is OK ish, with basic functions available to phones for years missing. Speed dial contacts on home screen. Once a norm, now hard to find. Google contacts will give option to add a contact to home screen, but it omits the option to make it a speed / direct dial action. It only opens that contact in the app... The whole point of sending a contact to home page is for this reason, to be able to directly dial key contacts. Please implement this feature. Now that google contacts for various reasons are becoming the default app, instead of an option, with native contact apps missing (like in recent Xiaomi phones which did have this feature) there is even more urge to add this functionality"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "I really... Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",
            "Why is it that I always get a 2 star superstar out of a premium I dont understand this concept is this luck or It is decided before itself that a 3 or a 4 star is not available in a premium otherwise this game is good! Keep it up!"

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "I really like this game it's been 4 years that I'm still playing it, well the game changed so much and everything get even more better, more fantastic and nice, im still playing it and I really like it cus of the gameplay and everything, well it takes much to explain why I like it, but I suggest people for downloading it and u will love it.",
            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",
            "I really like this game,but sometimes i really always logging idk why im not full storage,i have 16GB and idk why this is happening in my cellphone but tnx qlot IGG games i still loving and playing this game but i dont like in this game i always loggong and quiting automatically,But i will always love this game but i will rate thia only 4 sorry IGG but i st8ll love your games..",
            "I love this game, but what the actual F. Lost connection? I spent 3 hours on a base design. 4 bars wifi. Perfect connection. All that base progress is gone. That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",

Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "It was all fine until I had to transfer to YouTube Music, which to listen to music properly, requires a subscription. But YouTube didn't transfer my music, it just didn't work, which is frustrating. They don't care about people's satisfaction in listening to music, they only care about gaining money through subscriptions. Google Play Music was good, see that key word, was. YouTube Music doesn't need my money so I could listen to my music. It needs better function.",
            "It was working fine. I could happily listen to music offline. I honestly think that YouTube Music is really pointless since there's already a bunch of songs, covers, and instrumentals on YouTube itself. This is only getting a 1 star review and I have no actual regrets. Honestly who was dense enough to think of this idea, they should've known that no one would like this idea, it's such a fraud. If we now need internet to listen to music then that's really dumb. Have fun reading all the reviews",
            "Used the app a lot from the get go. Worked perfectly. I put all of my purchased/downloaded music on it for about 3-4 years. Then, the app was \"moved\".... along with all of my music. 3 years worth of music erased completely. I'm pretty disgusted.... so much, that I don't even want to give YouTube music a chance once I saw that my music wouldn't transfer. Not one song. All of my playlist titles are there... but no songs. I've tried multiple times and searched extensively. It's a complete RIP off.",
            "I have been using this app for years, even I changed phones. And I am happy to use it even when offline. The last time I used this app was yesterday before updating. Then I realized the app is discontinued and becomes Youtube Music. The wonderful memories and arranged music just gone. Well, it is nice while it lasted and it's time to move on. Goodbye.",
            "This app was perfect. Loved the format. Very user friendly. Love the fact that I could play music on my phone while phone was asleep or when using other apps. YouTube music sucks . I have to keep my phone awake while using. Also I can't easily play my personal music downloaded to my phone. Ill pay for Google music if I have to. How can I get it back? F your commercials, F your format, change something that was flawless. I will never listen to any music on YouTube music."

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",

There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

        "comments": [
            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "Jio was one of my favourite network. Now it has became Jio 2G. The internet speed is so slow that I can't even send messages while chatting. I'm planning to port my number. I'm getting high speed only when I call 199(Jio general helpline). After the call the internet speed becomes 2G again. This is so annoying. When I call that number, all of a sudden the range and internet speed increases. So horrible experience with Jio.",
            "Prime membership was deactivated without notifying the customer. As per terms and conditions if one downgrades or unsubscribe the plan then on the membership will be deactivated, but no where it is mentioned that if there is a gap of two recharges the prime membership will be deactivated. This was never commucated with the customers. Even your team is least bothered to notify the customer. Dropped and email but no proper service. What is use of collecting money and not providing service.",
            "The app was working perfectly, but then a couple of weeks ago it stopped updating the data usage and also how much data is left, then it stopped giving alerts for the next recharge which used to appear before when the due date approached. Please check it out and see what's the problem.",
            "It is a very bad networking site . In last few years, I have very very bad experience with it. The main problem is that, if you want to open Google,it takes long time to open. I have complaint many times but they always say that sorry for this we are working on it. It does not deserve even a single star. I think , I am going to mnp it in vi or airtel.",
            "I used Google Pay UPI @VPA to resolve late night payments via local banks. App is great. Only wish app wouldn't upload my contacts online, especially on Jiophone. This behaviour makes me distrustful of all apps, even if it is for getting names for numbers in Jio contacts database. Customer Service is awesome except for early days when we'd lose next day's data balance if we used full data close to the cut-off time of the daily data reset. Was bad on weekends! CS had no clue how to help & no data"

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

The only restoration is to wipe my phone, use Pixel backup, still lose a week's of conversations, and then manually backup my SMS content each day.

        "description": "Two factor authentication (2FA) is easy, convenient, and secure when you use Microsoft Authenticator. Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

        "descriptionHTML": "Two factor authentication (2FA) is easy, convenient, and secure when you use Microsoft Authenticator. Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.<br><br>Microsoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.<br><br>You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.<br><br>Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device.

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

            "I've been on and off with this app for years. It's had so many changes throughout the years but this latest version has got to be the worst. The latest interface is just clunky. The old one was better. Another thing: there was two versions of this app. The original version was this free one. Now it's not free anymore? How is it that you guys are putting a premium on this one when you already made another pro version that you had to pay for? Just keep this one separate and free.",
            "Wow... just wow. Downloaded app a while back, and was pretty good! Unlocked all the fx options by watching videos, and was able to actually use the app.new update comes in, cant do anything but watch ads. Now even the previously free fx effects are now \"premium\", and whenever you click the fx tab, it brings up the subscription page, interrupting your doing. And when you exit THAT add, ANOTHER one comes up! Worst update ever.",
            "This pirch bar is a joke, can barely set the bpm right without using the sync button. You ruined it, the previous one was way better. It's nice that you can apply 2 effects on a track at the same time unlike before the update, but now they're smaller which makes it harder to use with my chunky fingers, i often screw it up because of that. The eq slides were narrowed down, bad idea. The automix button just simply shouldn't exist or place it somewhere else where you can't press it by accident.",
            "Don't even bother updating it, when you try to change the tempo/pitch of the song, its too hard to get it accurately to where you want it to be using the bar, the way it was before was way better and the worst part is they charge you for recording, they'll do everything and anything for money....",
            "I absolutely love love love this app great for beginner djs or just to have fun my only problem is that I cannot record anything I mix through SoundCloud even if I do buy premium. if there is a fix for this I would love to hear about it also would like to see more personalization opinions when you do pay for it"

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "Mine is fine but there are reports of people experiencing issues with updating. When they update the app it is still the old build and not the new one. If you uninstall and reinstall the app it is still the old one. There are a reports of people on Reddit experiencing the same issues. A friend of mine has the same issue he had a Samsung GS20+ Android 10 and it won't update to the latest version and he's not alone.",
            "The layout is much better but functionality wise it's worse. The store doesn't allow you to filter so you can't separate dlc from games. Also trying to access my account details (Transaction History, Redeem Code) also doesn't work. I'm prompted for a username and password and keep getting a \"Connection to the server could not be established error\".",
            "New UI is a really mixed bag. It's overall much snappier and the pull down menu for chat and friends is great. However, the new store is terrible! I used to love checking out sales on the app, but its a huge pain now since they completely removed filters like sort by price or alphabetically. Also they bafflingly don't show game titles in plain text anymore(only box art) and some are really hard to read if the text is too small.",
            "New update to the PS Store is a major downgrade. Wishlists are gone which is what I used to keep track of the games I wanted to buy. Browsing through the store is slow and painful now that they only show you box covers instead of easy to read text. Many box covers are hard to read and don't differentiate between full games and addons. This new layout is going lead to me purchasing a much smaller number of games in the future do to the new increased difficulty of finding anything.",
            "The integration of the ps store is great to see as well. I don't know if I'm blind tho but it's a shame the wishlist isn't in the app. Edit: From 4 to 3 stars Also comparing trophies isn't possible anymore and it seems they really emphasized their blogs now. Not everyone reads articles. If you have given special treatment towards the people who like reading articles, hopefully you'd bring back the basic ones you haven't included and removed."

            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting again😂🤣. It couldn't stop me from laughing.🤣😂🤣",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

Question: is it possible to include in the options menu the ability to move the controller position to the player's liking? The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "Most of the videos which have \"4K\" tag near them are running merely on 720p. Only 3 in 100 videos have really 4K support and being limited to 720p on a 55\" screen is pure torment. What have you done to the app, it was working perfectly before?! This problem is going on for the last 3 days. Internet speed is not an issue, no problem is present in other apps on TV and Youtube apps on other devices, only on Youtube TV app.",
            "What have you been doing, Google? You've totally screwed up YouTube for Android TV. In the last couple of weeks, more often than not, it gets stuck with the spinner on the loading screen and never gets past that. I have to repeatedly kill it off (because, you know, it's too stupid to time out!) and go through it several times before it will actually get past that. And no, it's not a problem with my device, my internet connection or anything at my end. This was a change you made recently. And it's killed it. But clearly, you don't care. Why would you - what choice do I have?",
            "My Android TV supports the Thai language, other apps are able to search in Thai language. Youtube TV decides to say \"screw you\" to anyone who tries to search in anything other than English characters. Not being able to search in the languages that are supported on the device is stupid. Also, YouTube TV app used to be able to search using the build in keyboard. Changing to use a custom keyboard that copied an Apple TV 3 layout is a big step backwards. Actively looking for an alternative to this junk",
            "Since the new update, All the 4k videos that used to run without buffer on 40 Mbps connection on my tv started to stuck at one point for eternity and doesn't play past that point. You are suggesting people to increase bandwidth instead of investigating the issue. My point is how is this possible that with the same connection on which they used to run smooth could not play anymore but only buffer. If you suggest double checking my connection speed, I have hit it several time and it is as same as it was before the issue appeard from your update. Please hold yourself responsible and accept that this is indeed the issue from your side. There is no option for half or zero star but take one for the same. And last but not least, I don't get the updated UI on my KD-SONY55A8G. Thanks.",
            "Maybe this seems minor, but it's hard to overstate how distracting the animated thumbnails are, and I can't believe there's no option to disable them. Every single time I highlight a video while browsing, it starts animating away from the static thumbnail that caught my attention, and I immediately wonder whether or not I'm even highlighting the video that I intended anymore. Animated thumbnails provide no value at all and only result in a more distracted browsing experience. Let me turn it off."

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

I asked to my sis(Who play this game)she said\"No\"So I am also going to download it because of the color activity because I can draw beautiful,And I really like this game I recommend this game to all speacially kids because this game is for kids but other like adults, young,old",
            "Intrusive ads in a kids drawing app. Ridiculous.",
            "My daughter kept hitting their stupid advertising plug and was constantly being kicked from the game. The multi touch for the dragging the shapes around is garbage also. She knew where the shapes needed to go but it kept giving her the error noise",
            "I am a 33 year old male and I have never seen colour before since I am colour blind. I have recently undergone eye surgery and I can finally see colour. I decided to download this app so I know which colour is which and oh my goodness if this isn't the BEST app I've ever downloaded i don't know what is. I recommend this to everyone of all ages. P.s. you are never too old to learn!"

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",

            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

It&#39;s the same Fruit Ninja you know and love, but with gorgeous new visuals and tech! Slice fruit like never before in glorious high definition!<br><br>With this remake, we also have big plans for future updates that just weren&#39;t possible before. Stay tuned!",
        "comments": [
            "What the HELL is this new update? I thought this game was one of the few that weren't THAT outright money hungry, but now you removed the powers from all the blades and dojos I got from YEARS of hard work playing this game, just to introduce gems and loot boxes? The looks improved amazingly, they were truly outdated, but for the 10th anniversary instead of new exciting features you implement LOOT BOXES, HALFBRICK? You guys need help. Uninstalling and boycotting this everywhere I can.",
            "This used to be the height of childhood gameplay. The graphics USED to be fabulous, the menus USED to be well set up and intuitive, the missions USED to be fun. In other words, Fruit Ninja has been sllwly sinking lower and lower, and the recent 10th Anniversary Update has made it hit rock bottom.",
            "Gameplay wise the game is very fun. However one thing I've noticed in the new update is that you need to open loot boxes to get certain blades when all the blades used to use the level system. There shouldn't be a paywall for blades you once could unlock by playing normally in a previous update. Also this app stutters quite a lot and my phone usually handles games decently. For reference I'm using a samsung a20 for my device.",
            "Fruit ninja has always been one of my favourite games since the past so many years. Even my kids enjoy playing it. Two days back it got updated automatically. Shows upcoming additions. My only glitch is the new music when fruits arw cut. Can we have the old one back. This is not 'music to ears' as was the earlier one. Its disturbing and irritating, not in the flow of the game. Sync is also way off. Not in sync with when fruits are cut.",
            "Not impressed with the 10th anniversary update. The blades and dojos all seem to be the same. Some missions aren't registering your points and you can't change the missions as in the past. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. But if not, I'll be deleting"

            "Part1. Game play is too fake. The whole idea is to generate money by making the pre-fold best hand lose so the players keeps buying chips to continue playing. No doubt about it. Nobody should download this game. You will lost all your chips on the river card. Just make sure play with only free money. Don't buy chips. Worst ever game!!!!!! I noticed that they will only reply on good reviews and only technical feedback. Never have they commented how is suck. How much money does this game make?",
            "The game itself is good. However for those who play frequently the winning chance are almost 0.01%. Although they said the 'algorithm' is fair. It is not true. If you have a winning streak for example there would be a time where you will be losing your money, thus it will pushes the player to buy chips using your own money. Its a not good game. For a player like me don't like to spent too much money on game that doesn't rewards us of anything.",
            "Like all the others, it sucks you in fast and then you have to pay to compete. They give you a lot of free chips for a couple days and then you need to buy chips to complete because the adds don't even cover one buy in and the bonuses slow down to almost non existent. No long term, top, player in this game exist without consistent in game purchases. Why can't we just play a poker game without pretending to be billionaires? Just play poker and watch an ad here and there if needed. Greed",
            "Put simply with the new greedy higher Zynga take / rake portion for sit and go's and cash games even if you're a winning player you lose your chips -> pointless. This along with the even worse than before fake predetermined scenarios sent out instead of actual real card distribution is the last straw. How often is it straight over 2 pair, flush over straight, full house over flush. Too many times to be possible in real cards! Fake! NOT random cards. Devs say that these predetermined scenarios are randomly handed out to players to get their crappy certification but it's not random cards and the fake set-ups just get more obvious and annoying the more you play and this aspect like other recent changes seems to have been also tweaked for the worse. I'm out. Used to be an ok experience but not anymore. Closed my account. I imagine that they are losing users in general. I don't miss it.",
            "Rubbish, a con, you play hands where you have the winning hand to be beaten on last card by a hand statistically your unlikely to get, I played over 200 hands with no winning hand. Its a game full of bots to then make you purchase chips, when you spend money on this game you lose more chips, it's a joke. Also when you make purchases you see there is say 5millionin the pot, you win it and only get credited 4.2million its not right at all. You only notice it on larger tables. This game is rigged t"

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",

So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for.

            "If you love ads interupting game play, this one is for you!!! You'll get to experience more ad time than game time. You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

            "I decided to buy the Plus version to have the cloud backup functionality because there is a lot of valuable information in it. I use this app for more than six years now.  After a reinstall of the app, I needed to do a Cloud Synchronization, but I get the message: Temporary password has expired and must be reset by an administrator. I tried to contact the developer via e-mail, but I don't get any reply. And when I try the Forget Password option, I get the message User password cannot be reset in the current state. So there is no way to contact the administrator to reset my password, and I can't access my cloud backup. I am very eager to get the information that is in my backup and I am disappointed that I am now completely dependent of an administrator (or developer) that I cannot reach.  It makes me very sad that I have lost more than six years of valuable information. I hope it can be fixed.",
            "This app is great but if you ever change device and what to sync to the cloud to access your backup you can't, which makes the paid version useless. And password/logins cannot be reset. Developer is uncontactable as well so there's no support for this matter, although he was around for the same issue last year. The app is a rort now. Such a shame as it houses all of my memories of my children.",
            "I've used this app for all 4 of my kids. That's nearly 7 years now. Recently I've been having trouble with the app logging activities out of nowhere, and logs of activities in the scheduler that seem to span entire days, but don't exist in the history. Maybe the last update has something to do with it? Other than that I love this app. I would like a companion app for my smart watch though, so I don't have to find my phone before feeding my newborn.",
            "It works well and it's very useful but the interface is boring and not very \nnice. It would be good to be able to share the app and info with my husband \ntoo. Also the ability to not time the breastfeeding. I also find hard to \nscroll through the old data in the daily activity log calendar, you can \nonly keep scrolling down and if I want to look months back it's just \nimpossible and can only use the standard calendar and select a precise date.",

There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

Which are Essential to the progression of the game. I must ask. Why the change from coins to Premium currency? considering there are 10 Tap upgrades PER Floor. Multiplied by 3 Gems Plus 5 or 6 idle time upgrades If the idle upgrades were Always 5 gems a piece that TOTALS 55 PER FLOOR! ASSUMING the idle upgrades Stay At 5. A piece which is FALSE",

The only suggestion I have is to provide more blurring options because the blurring effect is too weak in this app. But that's the only thing that I've seen that could use a little extra of. Everything else is perfect. Very deserving of 5 stars and I've used many different apps. This one is the best!! Thank you for developing such an awesome app!!",
            "Fotogenic allows the user to intuitively highlight and accentuate photographic points of interest, eliminate distracting background/foreground features, and fully customise the appearance of the form, coloration, opacity, axis orientation, size/scale, focus, shading, brightness & vividness, overall design/detail, framing, and artistic implication of any digital photograph. From a consumer perspective, I highly recommend this app to beginner and adept on-the-go editors alike.",

            "This game was great and made me feel like I was playing mirrors edge all over again. It did have ads, but that's not why I am not giving it 5 stars as it's a mobile game and I only saw an add every 3 to 4 stages. The reason I am rating it 4 and not 5 is the frame rate. Frame rate is key in these sorts of games. It ran smoothly mostly but sometimes I would encounter frame drops, not massive, but enough to send me plummeting to my doom. Otherwise, the controls are great. And no micro transactions"

        "comments": [
            "Overall, I really enjoy the app but its not without its flaws. I understand that you need premium to remove the watermark but it does not need to be that freakin' large on the screen. Also there should be more variety with the text and effects; the options are good but not really enough. The positives with PowerDirector are unlike these other video editing apps, this has always been easy to use and the options aren't confusing to figure out. I'd recommend this app for starter youtubers!",
            "I used to rate this app with 5 stars, but just before I wrote this review, I was editing a video, and I found a lot of bugs, but the one with most impact is that it usually stops the video for a while between transitions, and that's really annoying because it would make a delay between the main video and the voiceover. Please fix this bug, it didn't use to be like this.",
            "FACT: There is no better video editing app out there for mobile platforms. It's fast, has tons of options and is considerate of phone resource usage. I edit all my YouTube channel videos with it. To see what can a small example of what can be done, check out some of the more recent videos on my channel \"WalkingtheSabbathTalk\". All videos edited with this mobile app.",
            "Update: when they updated this app it now fails to play back any edited video you may be working on . Audio and video is out of sync and very choppy. Impossible to use. Needs to be fixed or I will finish off my three-month subscription and go elsewhere. I do love the editor but the problem I'm having is that my MP4 video files are not being accepted. Some are and some aren't. That for me is the deal breaker. I'm not going to pay a subscription anymore if I have troubles with it.",
            "Broken from last update. App crashes constantly. I can't edit anything. The moment I try, the app closes. (Even trying to change my subscription, I get a spinning wheel of death.) I have a new phone with plenty of storage and memory. This was pretty user friendly before. Now it's completely unusable. And a waste of money. Edit in response: Of course I tried restarting it. I also restarted my phone multiple times. This app made my phone heat up to a dangerous degree. I'll revisit if fixed."

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. 😊",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. 👍🏻"

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

Whether your children are younger or in their teens, the Family Link app lets you set digital ground rules remotely from your own device to help guide them as they learn, play, and explore online. For children under 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your country), Family Link also lets you create a Google Account for your child that's like your account, with access to most Google services.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With Family Link parental controls, you can:\r\n\r\n Guide them to good content\r\n\r\n • View their app activity - Not all screen time is the same. Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their Android device, with activity reports showing how much time they’re spending on their favorite apps. You can see daily, weekly, or monthly reports.\r\n • Manage their apps - Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device, all remotely from your own device.\r\n • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Keep an eye on screen time\r\n\r\n  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.\r\n  • Lock their device - Whether it’s time to go play outside, have dinner, or just spend time together, you can remotely lock a supervised device whenever it’s time to take a break.\r\n\r\n\r\n  See where they are\r\n\r\n  • It’s helpful to be able to find your child when they’re on the go. You can use Family Link to help locate them as long as they’re carrying their Android devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Important Information\r\n\r\n  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at families.google.com/familylink/setup\r\n  • While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\r\n • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.\r\n • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.\r\n • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.\r\n • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience, it does not make the internet safe.

However, the app presents a lot of bugs related to time control and allowing apps - is not counting the time limit anymore, and I've blocked (turning off \"allow\" key) an app that still opening on the child phone. Please, correct this problem, I like the idea, but is not working...",
            "Although the app generally works for limiting children's access to the phone, it has unfortunate bugs. The worst thing about it is that Google doesn't really provide useful customer service. After two weeks of back and forth emails where I had to explain the issues that I'm facing over and over, their best suggestion was to reset the phone to factory settings! A very dis-satisfactory experience.",
            "Even after changing my son's settings we still cannot access many websites, and need permission for everything despite changes being made. I went ahead and created a new email for him not linked to me to use that one for homeschooling. He signed out of his account on accident and now I cannot get back in without first signing into the family linked account and then we're stuck again. Nothing but a pain. :(",
            "Have had it for several months. Noticed a few weeks ago it no longer registers if time limit has been reached on my son's chromebook. It alerts them that their time is almost up, but doesnt register any time used on my end. I have to manually lock their device and unlock it again.",
            "Worst App Ever. I spent 4 hours trying to set up my daughter's new tablet and Google Family Link app doesn't work and will not let me log into her account or add her account to my Google account. It's trash and needs to be fixed if your forcing the app on people. I need a real LIVE customer service rep to help me out."

If you fix this i will rate 5 stars edit: you fixed it 😁👍 Thank you",

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",
            "Gameplay has become fantastic since the last update. Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence. I have earned over 30 million essence but still haven't finished it up yet. But the legendary essence is getting finished quickly. Please resolve this issue.",

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

I have loved the cricket experience so far and I've been a customer for about six months now and would recommend anyone with a contract to think about switching. Low monthly plans.",
            "EDITED Review: Initially it worked great. Five dollars off with auto pay via app. Cool, ty. Then it started saying my debit card wasnt up to date (its 2 months old) when all was correct. To pay over the phone or in person there is a \"customer service\" fee. So between the 5 I would get from auto pay savings and the fee I pay 10 additional dollars per month because of this faulty app. Essentially I have been repaying 1/3 of my bill due to their error.",
            "Data stinks and my phone slows to fast and I have access unlimited data. U can't even get a new phone. I rather go to simply mobile or metro pcs. The phone I bought was from rent a center years ago, it's a Samsung galaxy J7(2016) version. So it's not a cricket model, I haven't had a cricket phone since several years because I was having problems with every phone. Metro will let you get a free phone for Switching. I'm on a very tight budget and fixed income.",
            "Besides the fact that the app sometimes won't work. There is the issue that when you have a phone that's not working it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I've even tried the customer service line for my cell phone. But without being able to review the items that we purchase through cricket, they aren't really able to know when a company is providing crappy product. I've also had an issue with the last two devices that I've purchased not being able to connect to wifi!",
            "Their websites don't work, their app doesn't work! Made faithful payments for over four years. Missed my payment on the 1st But it wasn't due till the 2nd. Tried to make payments all day on the 2nd and couldn't get through. Then I get charged $15 because I make the payment 9 hours late the day after. When you called to complain the manager will just hang up on you! Even if you don't swear! Worst company! Most of them don't understand English!"

I've been using it for 4 months now and the experience was out of this world, until I found out this bug in which, when a song is playing, the artwork of that song turns into distorted colours in the notification screen, this has been going on since this past month and I tried everything, even tried downloading other apps but I had to overlook this bug because I love this app so much, I really hope the app designer reads this comment and understands my problem.",
            "I love the app , I gave it a 3 cause recently when i download a new songs does not update into the app,never had the issue before takes a random amount of hours to update...and also it started to not show anything when u enter the app sometimes just see thr current song and u can play and skip,but no other option ......great app and I love the amplifier .just a few errors.",
            "I don't like the fact that music player turns on automatically when I am not even wanting to listen to music. There should be an option where I can manually turn it on when I feel like listening to music. Please fix. Thank you in advance. Other than that it's great. By the way it drains my battery when the music player turns on for no reason.",
            "The best music player that I have ever had, but this app got some minor issues, one of the is the NHS COVID-19 ad, it just freeses the app, it glitches the songs, the app can not be used anymore until the app is fully shut down, + the ad appears and when I'm not connected to the Wi-Fi",
            "Extremely Good but please it needs a fix because songs doesnt play in ordered list and plays randomly without a sequence,even if i dont want to listen to that song,it starts playing,i mean it doesnt play in sequence.Please fix because except this big problem ,i love the whole functions of the app .😭"

            "it's a fun game but I love everything but I wish there was more weapons like ice guns and stuff another thing is that I would like a online mode and friends. So recently I haven't seen any bugs or glitches so far and the ads you can get rid of them. I have been playing for 2 years now. This review was 1 hole year ago It's Now 2020. Good game. Create more games you only have 2. Hey Mr. Develeper can you actually listen to me because We need an update with more weapons and career. More players.",
            "Really, really good game, play it with my friends all the time. It's really fun, but I think you should add an online section that counts your points when you win against actual humans. So you should add an online where you play against other people in the world and there should be a leaderboard, can you please add this. Please. And also this game is quite smooth on all phones that are generally modern.",
            "This is amazing. I played on a friends iPad and I loved it. The simple to understand but hardish to control battle style is a blast and evens the some op weapons out. I've mained cards as it is just so much fun, want to keep enimies back? Sticky card. Want to deal damage? Explosion card. About to fall off the edge? Place swap card. Anywho this game is just amazing and good gameplay. 5/5. Simply amazing.",
            "Hello developers i hope you see this! I've been playing this game for so long and i loved it!But here's what i really want you to add in a new update:- *Online Multiplayer (upto 4 players with big maps) *Skins:like colors,hats,mask,suit,and if you could add a shop section it would be nice! *Private lobby to play with friends:-) *Make more buttons for eg:- Jump,special power,shield, etc. So,please developers notice my concerns, just a little improvement would make your game more fun. Thanks.",
            "This game, is one of the most original games based off of popular pop-culture hostory. Which is very impresive from my point of view, this game is so good, other people make games that try to live up to this standard exactly how this came to sucess. I love this game and will appreiciate it for as long as it is avalible on this very app store... :]"

            "Excellent game . I liked it's graphics and tricks . I will like the game more and more if you make bonus mode unlock with coins in game , not with real money . And also , you have also made the game shadow fight 2( sf2 ) and vector , i ......... i really can't even forget the name shadow fight 2 and vector because i liked these games very very much . These 2 games are me top 2 favourite games . The excellent games i have played ever .",
            "This game is really good! But i only have one problem. When you play this game with no Wifi (which you can)why does it take so long for it to load when you skip through the story? But when you have wifi it doesn't take that long for it to load. That is one thing i suggest you guys to fix=). But overall the game is really not that bad.",
            "This is unexpectedly very difficult, lots of retries to complete a level, requires very good skill as the actions are very sensitive, you go to jump but it slides instead due to you unconciously moving your finger down before moving it up, same goes for dashing, it is easy to move downwards while sliding to the right screen, excellent animation for parkour and movement, long jumps require very good timing as you can easily miss if you jump when you are not almost right on the ledge when you jump",
            "Literally does not work for longer than 5 minutes. The first level was great. Worked well, lots of fun. The second level, the tricks would trigger 50% of the time. The third level, the tricks stopped working altogether. Sometimes, the jumps and slides wouldn't even register. When I exited the app and went back into it to see if a restart would fix it, it wouldn't even launch. It literally broke after the first launch. Awful.",
            "Well I liked the game but it's sure have to pay for the other levels some people don't know how to do it because some kids play this game not only adults but it's a nice game but very uhm there is some bugs that is bothering me when I done playing the game I log off and then even if I pay the screen just start to the next level and sometimes I accidently press the play button. And it's really bothering me but it's a good game"

            "dude the game is great it is fun and all but pleeeease fix the adds. I can never find a exit sign on an add and it just goes on forever and adds run while you are playing a level, that is messed up. so adds literally destroyed the levels I was playing. I can only play it on airplane mode, but then i cannot get the upgraded canon and other things. so it is annoyingggggg. please fix it..... i gave 1 star because of that. otherwise the game is great. so sorry.",
            "The gameplay is simple & relaxing and I enjoy playing. Although it's free to play, I expect to watch ads, however, there are ads before & after each level, from 2 ads @ 5 seconds each and many 30 seconds. So if you enjoy watching ads more than playing the game, you will enjoy this game. For me, I watch less ads on YouTube than I do with this game. Thanks for a unique game, but no thanks. UNINSTALLED.",
            "This is a very nice app. If you play it offline it will be very fun and I liked this app very much. I have no complaint with this app. It is a normal and fine game. To make it more interesting after four levels there is a boss level and I like it the most. Reccomend to play it!",

            "Actually game is too much good,but in the 22 level one add was coming there is not have options to close it continuously running the game i checked almost 20 mints, i cleared catch also,plese solve and let me know, i will play game again"

The ads make the game nearly unplayable. And the subscription to eliminate the ads is a complete money grab. Iknow companies have to make money, but this is insane.",

Om Nom is cute when he's eating and when he's disappointed you've lost his candy. I really wish I didn't have to go through all those ads to play. Half the time I'm on the app is spent waiting for the ads to play through. That's why it's free",

            "Overall, I like this app. I just have a couple suggestions to make. -Add a trash feature, so that you still have some time to get a deleted picture back in case you accidentally delete something or change your mind. -Add a slider to the video playback. With really long videos, it's annoying to have to watch the entire thing through to get to certain parts, even with the fast-forward.",
            "This app is great! There's not that many ads, there's the right amount of tools to make wonderful drawings! It can be a little confusing at first but you'll soon get used to it! The only problem I have is, you have to have a membership to rearrange art order in your gallery?? I know they need to make some money somehow but... That just seems ridiculous and unnecessary, but other then that it's great!",
            "I need help, like when I was coloring the drawing that I just finished, suddenly it disappears, i was very scared of what just happened, i think I can redo it but I clicked on the redo button for like 1000 times it still doesn't give me back my drawing. I'm very anxious after what just happened. So can someone please help me out with this, please...😰😰😰😰",
            "This is byfar one of the best and very intuitive drawing app, I can work faster using Ibis compared to when I'm working with another drawing app. Stabilizer works great, doesn't stabilize too much, although I'd rather have the heavy stabilizer as optional because sometimes I need it too. Or at least there's more curved or flex ruler.",
            "I love this app and I would recommend but you have to be aware of lower battery and deleting this app. But there are so many cool things you can do. I use this all the time. It's easy, fun and free only, you have to watch an add before using all brushes. This is good quality and needs no WiFi."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

Just an idea. Beggars shouldn't be choosers. Sorry. Requires too many resources. I give 5 stars. I will recommend this to family and friends. Thank you.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

Sadly, it can glitch sometimes and it is way to difficult. I have read other reviews and lots of people have this problem. Also, too many ads. There is an ad for every level and if you die, even if you don't choose to revive by watching an ad, you have to watch one. Also you never get any revives so you are forced to watch an ad to revive.",
            "This game is overall good but to many ads. I understand that u are getting paid for the ads and what not but there is to many.Therefore i play Rise Up offline when i am in the car or just bored outside of home. It is a rlly hard game but is brilliant for getting rid of bordem. Keep it up Rise Up but remove most ads pls. Yours Faithfully, chocolatesarefood",
            "I give you 5 stars because. I played a lot's of games means nearly 2 thousands game and this game is one of best game in my life. Yes, there are some missing things or some bugs. I think if we observe the game Defrently like it's music, it's theme, it will inspire us, this game will motivate us. And thing, if we play this game form our heart with Egnoring some bugs then this game will teach us how to survive in the world. It's my opinion. AND SORRY FOR MY POOR ENGLISH. 🙂🙂",
            "Enjoyable game to play, but there are some seriously savage bugs. Given that I write console games for a living, I know about bugs, but these surely couldn't have gone unnoticed? Shouldn't have been released in this state as it doesn't do a lot for your credibility. Also, the fact you run an advert every other play through, well, that just craps all over the general experience. Pity, this could have been a great game if it wasn't for the poor advert decisions and dubious execution.",
            "5 stars! Absolutely 5 stars! This game is so addictive i even have to take a break every day because of it, and im not mad at all! This game is very good to play when you are bored, and ads dont pop up as much as they do in other games. Totally amazing! I'd recommend this game to kids who are bored on the holidays or even the weekend!"

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "Grow castle is an amazing game. They are constantly fixing bugs and adding new enemies and hero's to the game. They have clans so you can play multiplayer and chat with other people about the game and you can continue having fun for a long time as they have dragon/boss fights that continue up to months past you're download of the game. It can be played competitively and casually and overall it's a game that I think everyone should download at least once. I think they should add more music.",
            "I like this because there is not adds. The only time there are adds is if you need coins. If you are also tired of playing these other games that are the same then play GrowCastle . Its fun and active you can join groups and try to be the best group. I play Growcastle when I am bored. I like this game a lot so i think you shuold play it. This is why I am giving it a 5 star rating",
            "Ive played this game for years, and still enjoy playing it. Im on wave somewhere in the thousands now and i still enjoy it. Even at big levels its not really grindy and there isnt many ads at all and you almost have to pay for nothing other than a few things. Though i would really like some new game macanics like just more heros or maybe more things to fight. But more than that there should maybe be more town stuff. I would like more stuff that gets unlocked and changes the game more often.",
            "This game is the best RPG game-type ever! This game has no add pop-ups at ramdom time which is like Tap Titans 2. You must watch an add if needed 3× game speed or free coins. I play this game Grow Castle if I'm bored playing other games. This game makes me addicted like literally can't stop playing this game all day! I love the graphics, controls and even the gameplay! I'd rate this a 5 star for this game! 🤩",
            "I'd say its fun, really simple when you start and once you understand the game it gets more complicated which is great because you don't get overwhelmed. its well paced and a good game to get if you're just looking to try something new. especially because it's not littered with ads you can't avoid. all ads are optional."

I never had a problem no need to pay but you have to play hard and i kinda have like 40 legendary cards so it dosent force you to pay. Events are cool will give you more chances of getting legendary cards . ! NOW JUST WAITING FOR PVP! Please make it happen real fast!",
            "So, this game has good graphics ,but the thing is that when we fight duels if gives us chest ,but if we keep getting strong oppenents which is better then us , then there is 60% that we will lose . And then we will lose trophies and then we cant get rewards that we want at the end of the season , so i hope NEKKI helps this and gives us Like not very strong oppenents like i am at 987 power and when i fight , the oppennent is 995 power , that will be much easier and i will appriciate this game.",
            "The thing i like about this game is that it has realistically functional moves in an environment that does not disregard the laws of physics. Well, there's this shadow energy bit in the game which is quite magical...u can call it a fantasy or something. But hey, a little supernatural element is essential for a good action game. However, it's quite easy you know, it has simple controls, and some of the moves of some weapons can be spammed to win almost any battle."

            "App UI is very bad, first of all the app roll out should be like Netflix so that most Android TV's can install it. Amazon should discontinue this app and port the one on FireTV as it has the X-Ray feature and Video Preview. The Prime Video App on FireTV has a much Clean and Decluttered UI and is pretty smooth although it does have dependencies on the core apps of Fire TV as that App doesn't have standalone login. (Even though the specs of my Android TV are higher than the FireTV 4K and yet the Android TV app lags a bit)",
            "- does not remember series, season and episode that was being watched which requires cumbersome navigation - can't properly restart already watched episode, since it starts at the end and almost immediately jumps to the next - does not save state when app is going to background, preventing easy continuation -owned material not shown on the start page even when recently watched With those fixed, it would be a good app.",
            "Was not able to install it on my new android tv. The website says registration is successful, however the registration is not recognized by the app within the tv. No proper error messages. Disappointed with my experience.",

The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "Game double jumping: so cool to double jumping Red Ball. it is to double jump in order to double jump we all have to press the up button 2 time's. in laptop or mobile phone. if you play in laptop you can glitch the game. Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "It's been years now since I've started using Poweramp as my primary music player, and I would say it's still the best Android music player out there. I also VERY MUCH appreciate how you added the \"Play next\" & \"Queue\" option, because before that, I thought that was the only thing this app was missing. It just makes it a lot more convenient. However, is there something I can toggle in settings that would fix the distortion whenever there's a notification or when the screen times out?",
            "At first the app couldn't find any audio files on my device, even after I went out of my way to give it explicit permission to access all files and then perform a \"full rescan.\" After reinstalling it and trying again, it worked. I wish I could sort by album artist so that artists like \"X feat. Y\" would not show up separately from \"X\". This issue makes it hard for me to sort through my library.",
            "This is the best of the best music player available for Android right now!! I have tried a variety of music players in the store, but none were upto my liking. When I listen to music, I am more concerned about the audio quality it delivers, rather than how the UI looks. This player serves both purpose by delivering a clear, balanced sound in all tones and a clean and smooth user interface. This is a must-have app for all music lovers like me.",
            "I have been using this app for years. I first downloaded it on S2 Mini running on Android Honeycomb when the rest of the world was on KitKat. I was so glad to have such a powerful app running on such an old device and the equalizer settings really helped to make the listening very delightful. Now running on S10Plus with Android 10, well its just too easy to set it up and enjoy listening to music. Thank you for making this app the best music player app I've ever used since 2015...",
            "Very nice app with amazing animations and customization. However, I HAD no idea how to add my existing playlists and there are a bunch of audio tracks that use audio from videos on my phone. These are deep in the settings app and theres no reason they should be so hard to find Theres also a ton of customization that I have no idea about and I wish I could just disable the equalizer so I stop opening it. Still an amazing app, but a couple glaring but fixable issues"

            "Very nice game, I always wanted a game that 1. Was like salt 1 and salt 2 2. A game with no ads and doesn't sell personal information. 3. A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"🙈🙉🙊"

Compared poco and Nova, both without any widgets, and Nova had more battery consumption. For now I'll stick to poco. Maybe when I get a new phone (or install a custom ROM) then I'm trying Nova again 😁",

            "Used to be great but as my devices have gotten bigger I've noticed that the inability to place folder icons at the bottom of the folder is really becoming an issue, especially if using one hand. Folders are becoming useless in that regard, it's easier just to create another home screen and do your best to organize.",
            "The only flaws I see with Nova and Nova Prime are as follows: I found it hard to set up the backup and restore directories. I always feel I can't to double-check the destination. I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

            "Despite the good premise of the game it has way too many ads. Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag.

The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "I think this game is amazing! Definitely recommend! 👍The graphics and flow of the movement is very good! And yes there's ads. (Obviously) But unlike most other games like these, the ads barely even bother you! The only trouble I'm having is sometimes when I collect keys or coins it lags just a bit, not enough to mess up the entire \"round\" though. Also anytime I'm trying to buy something (With in-game coins) It will switch to another thing like toppings or food items and buy those instead.PlzFix",
            "Game is fun but the levels actually only repeat it's self, i got all the foods with in 2 days, i got the unicorn in 1 day and the space cat in the 2nd day, i reccomend this game if u like saticefying games, add a longer and better level every now and then it would be great,i gave 3 stars because of the repeating levels and the quick ones to and because it is not very creative 👍🏻🙃",
            "I just downloaded this game and I already like it!Its very fun and reminds me of when me and my mum were baking together!It is hard to keep the cream on the foods,yes but besides from that I recommend downloading it! Also something pretty Annoying can happen where there is too many adds but the game 'yes that dress'(wich I'll recommend downloading to)has adds every next button so the game 'yes that dress'has more adds",
            "To say it's kinda boring but normally it's a very good game it's so much fun and it has a bit of slow motion when I ice the cream on top of the strawberries and waffles and just installed this game today!I'm 8 years old but this is 3 stars it's kinda boring",
            "I saw this in an ad ao i decided to try it. The idea itself sounlds not to bad, but it turned out to be a bit laggy and had this vibration everytime i squeezed the cream? I think the vibration is the point but i think the vibration feeling is annoying and bothering"

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

Wish more games would have this kind of setup. The developer did a wonderful job. The information is accurate and allows for easy access to multipliers and multiple maps. Always adds to my Ark experience in the best way possible.",
            "My friend used this app and now I can understand his gibberish by using this. It's got alot of good info in here ARK won't readily tell you and it sure changed how I played. Some of those Dinos I ignored...amazing! It also includes recipes which I really needed. My only complaint is how the mobile users info gets thrown in, making some info inconsistent.",
            "I personally love ark, and this app is a MUST HAVE for all survivors. Whether you play for fun, like me, or competitively, or even to see how much you're pc/console can handle, this app is for you, as it has kibble recipes, taming calculators, level spread calculators, and an extremely funny and helpful community",
            "it's very helpful in taming dino but can you also add some more features like for hunting dino how much ammo you will need like you show for taming and all the recipies for not only kibble but others also like guns and more and also can you show engrams which can unlock at which level because in ark mobile you can only see engrams which are going to unlock and rather than that the app is best and op keep it up",
            "I'm still learning new things every day on Ark, this ap has made life so much easier. the calculations will need to be adjusted (go to settings) to the server you play on. It calculates tame levels, tame knock out requirements, recipies, everything you'd need to know about what ever tame your hunting for. It also has a comment helping section, real players can comment on helpful tips about how they knocked out that tame."

            "Not near as good as the first one. The first one made sense with you just running from the guards and just doing awesome parkour while you are at it. This one tries to be more than it needs to. From jumping from building to building to jumping random bombs and dodging lasers that make no sense. this feels like a fan game. To over the top and nonsensical. Further in the future would be cool if we had any reason to care. This game wants you to run from nothing for no reason. An unnecessary game.",
            "I honestly liked the first vector more. This one is detailed and complicated while the first one was nice and easy to understand. Another thing I don't like about this one is that you can't restart the level while playing instead you have to finish the whole level first and then try again. It's just that having the restart bottom available in the options is so much more efficient. the last thing is that it doesn't give the star rating of how you did on the level unlike the first one.",
            "Have played \"'thrice\"' from floor 1 to 22 and after each attempt the game makes me start back from level 1 afresh...Thats so frustrating😡😡 i even got into episode 2, twice,but then the game started all over...I love the difficulty of the game and i'm okay with the numerous subjects, but its a no-no situation for the game restarting all over after going very far each time",
            "Fantastic! It's a great advance from Vector 1. Instead of hunting and being hunted it's about running and doing your best! Controls are a little \"not-working\" at the first of each level, but afterwards they become well, this feature adds more excitation. So keep playing and having fun and don't give up!",
            "I luv this game it's very cool and I am very satisfied that we can wear Armor in this one unlike the other one! Ya this game is a little difficult to understand but once u get it it's awesome. But I really loved that a guy chases us in vector 1 but in this one no one chases us so I actually wanted to give 4 1/2 star but we can't so I give it a 5 star. Really liked it and nekki also fixed the issue I pointed out in vector 1. Must play!"

            "This game is awesome my favorite game on this is zombie mode that is super cool and just game I don't know what to say I like the first and the other one they're good but this game is very amazing I hope you have some more updates like you game modes and I hope you have a good Halloween🎃",
            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

        "comments": [
            "I was using for the first time and I loved it, it was better than all the drawing apps I tryied. However, I was goig to reopen a drawing I did for several days and it was gone. Sketches keep on vanishing eventually and I don't know how to \"save\" an artwork with all the layers I need to use. Please solve this. Once it is completed, it will definitely be a 5 star app.",
            "So, I actively love this program, and don't want to rate it this low. It does nearly everything you could want in a digital stylus drawing tool. However, the quirks of the app are infuriating and many and will stop you dead in your work. The radial pattern tool will decide to shut off between layer switches, for example, and doesn't switch back when you go to the layer you were on to begin with, and you won't realize it until you zoom out. Also, what art program doesnt have a crop tool?",
            "I got used to the controls/bruches after a while, but there should be a more precise eraser, I would give it 4 stars, but the app suddenly wouldn't open. I even deleted it, along with all of my sketches in it, reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. I took screenshots of them in case if something like this happened, but I would like to still be able to use the app.",
            "As someone who can't afford an sketchpad and draws on the phone, this app is everything to me. I draw everything, from class to work to just my things, on here. It always worked perfectly, but lately some of the brushes glitch when using them, creating \"glitched\" lines that can't be erased or painted over, basically destroying part of the work. I would so love if this could be fixed. Until then, I have to rank it with 2 stars",
            "I used to adore this app. I loved being able to scan in my sketches, as well as the variety of different brushes that I had access to, all without having to pay, and with minimal ads, too. But, as of the past year, the file recovery bug has become an increasingly challenging problem, one which has been plaguing others for just as long and the developers have claimed to try to fix. The last straw was today, when a file I closed for three hours became corrupt in the process. I am deeply upset."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

This helps me support other indie businesses in my area. Now it just won't copy, won't hold the copied link or won't post to my Instagram. Frustrating, cos this was the full package and the ads were bearable.",

            "Used to love this app. Now all I ever get is \"Media error: Bad request\". I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well as cleared the cache. Fix this please and maybe I will change my rating.",
            "App doesnt trim videos! you set it up and trim a video and it plays the trimed version before re-posting then you re-post and it hasnt trimed, very frustrating, would love a fix for this, please let me know to improve rating. 02.01.2020-Any feedback on this yet? Would love a fix on this. Uninstalling, still can't trim videos, and now the ads are too big for the screen so you can't exit because the ''x'' is below the screen I've been hitting the back key on my Android but today the ad is stuck."

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "Scam, do not bother. Forces you to subscribe for almost 10 dollars - a month (!!!) before you even get to play, and then it is *still* choke-full of ads on every corner. The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",
            "I can't play.When I start the app, it shows me a way to continue and be a member(common)I click on the \"x\" and then another page appears wich allows me to pay for the membership I look and wait for an \"x\" I see none I can't do anything except pay wich I will NEVER do.I am really disappointed in this app I thought it would be fun but turns out it's just another stupid scam.DO NOT INSTALL.",
            "This is a horrendous app!! Won't allow you to even play, without paying 70 for a 1 year subscription. There is no way to exit, no X or option to use limited features. Total scam. Don't waste your time. Developers, you need to fix this issue!! Or delete the app!! Calling you out...",
            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

Last year, felt it was worth the money until this month's update. Wow, it is an incredible step backwards in design and functionality. Playlists cannot be re ordered, it takes extra clicks to do any task...they have until Christmas to straighten it out or I'm back to Amazon.",
            "Great music app, no question there. The recent update to the UI has placed your library as the last item in the hotbar at the bottom. Why? The primary function of this app is for people to listen to the music they want. If people want to discover new music, they will select that tab. Don't force people to go there when they open the app. I think the Spotify app opens directly to people's library. I suggest others try Spotify first.",
            "Seems to me you ruined a good app. I don't understand the order of anything or how to get to anything. 'Listen Now' seems a bit useless & redundant, as we already have radio. Have no idea what you all were trying to do here. Also, I know it trivial, but the colors throw me off the most. You even changed the widget I keep on my phone to a bright pink. PINK. The brightness agrivates my migraines, even in dark mode. At least give people a way to change the colors or opt back to the classic app look.",
            "Good for listening. Can be a pain to get music to download to my device and I really wish I had access to podcasts within the app. The latest update is stupid annoying. The listen now, browse and radio option are all basically the same thing, put it back. I hate having my main menu on the right side now. If you're going to do an update make podcasts accessible. It also randomly will pause my music for no apparent reason.",
            "There's an issue with sorting your library. The only options are playlists, artists, albums, songs and downloaded. Theres an edit feature where you can select the desired ways to sort your library but it does not work. I would like to sort by genre. There has been plenty of updates over the years however this issue has never been fixed."

First when the app tried to play an add it would come up with a screen that said the website can't be reached so I'd have to restart the app, and now whenever I open it it just closes itself. I tried restarting the app, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and I tried restarting my phone, But the issue persists.",
            "This game is so annoying it freezes after like 10 Minutes and is sooooo annoying the graphics are good enough and the controls are fine but please fix the freezing it's highly annoying I would give this game a 0 stars but that's not an option so fix it please this has such potential",
            "(Left the BETA to come review publicly.) Use to be the best free driving game. Now its just like ever other one.... Pay to play. Not just pay but pay monthly subscription.",
            "Very fun bit when a ad comes on it says this site has failed I tried everything u have to leave the game so you can still play I will change my rating to 5 stars when u fix this plz do I love this game and don't want to uninstall",
            "This is a great game!I have played this since 2015. But the reason I'm reviewing now is because I am bored.We need missions like bump 3 red cars or drive around the map and it gives u like 50 cash. The other reason is cos I feel like we need like way more maps and since I've stuck with the game so long I don't want to be let down by one update that has needed to be added. Only reason I have 5 stars is cos 1. I'm addicted and 2. U can turn off data for ads so idk y ppl complain about ads!"

            "I'm very picky with games, and this just managed to get past that barrier with stunning graphics and controls, its just a couple things that caught me off-guard. 1. Please add an arachniphobic option for those who need it! 2. Its hard to really progress when the banner keeps coming. 3. I feel like there isn't a good way to get farther. Every time you uninstall it or stop playing for a certain amount of time, it will wipe your data! 4. Everytime you jump, sometimes it pauses it for some reason :\\",
            "The graphics are incredibly amazing for a game that does not lagg very much. I like how tjere are a lot of things to do and you can live either indoor or outdoor and can raise a family too! Though the adds banner does get reaaallly annoying. It comes like everytime I go to sleep. And the skins are quite expensive. I understand you want some money, but maybe you should lower the amount of times the banner shows up.",
            "I underestimated this game. At first, I expected it to be a low quality game like most other simulators, but I was wrong! The graphics are great, I love the family feature and the customization, and especially the house area! Of course, the game can start to feel repetitive and slow, sometimes it just depends on your mood. I think it would be interesting to have more areas (like a modern world, a park, stores), or have more landscapes, like desert and snow. Overall, this is a great game!",
            "I love this game it is the best no bugs or gitches but i do want ,new places like the basement in the house and more mushrooms not amanitas , and you can add upstairs in the house or a grocery store and i wish the cats in the game could have kittens and for the mice more babies at 1 time pls, and add humans! well nice game!",
            "Still too sensitive and now the game is way too difficult. you spend all your time gathering instead od exploring like before. and by the time you half finish one quest you're too tired and hunrgy to get much farther. in short, this game got worse since I last played it in 2017"

            "Benji Bananas is a fantastic game, I love benji and his wife, the graphics are sooooo good and I also love benjis hair when it sways, my only request is the vine at the end of every level isn't as detailed as the other vines, and a bit glitchy, also at the end of level 2 benji goes through the waterfall and the rocks and sometimes even when I'm holding on it makes benji let go and he falls. Otherwise this game is great and I definitely recommend it👍",
            "It's very easy and best for boring people like me..but seriously ,it's very nice ..The graphics is excellent.. benjis wife looks too cute so as benji ,its very easy to love monkeys after you play this game ..Thank you so much ♡.but I think the tasks should be explained properly, its difficult for many to understand. .look after this Heyyy what is happening with me ,I'm installing it , it was processing also after 100% also its not there in my device. .......Please help me out",
            "5 stars it is! The game is amazing! I've had it for 2 months. The animations are really good just like the graphics. If it's bugging, it ain't the game.... It might be your phone or your internet cuz it never happened to me. The controls are very comfortable as long as you understand how swinging works. The only problem that I've had was that it was quite annoying to buy \"snake oil\" and \"smak a tiger\" every time though that's not a big of a deal ya know. I love that game its amazing",
            "It was wonderful playing the game, but that was ages ago. Eversince I accidentally dropped my mobile gadget & had slept over it many times over , LCD got busted & hadn't played the game since. I wld really like to play the game still tho'.",

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

            "There are too many ads and full commercials you have to watch now. The biggest problem is it gives you bubbles that are impossible to use so you run out, then you have to watch ads to get more.",
            "Games a cheater..Changes the color of the ball to make you lose..Makes the arrow loose and all over the place when you want to shoot ..This only happens when your at the end of the game and only have a couple shots left..",
            "Have played this game for a couple of years now. It used to be fun. Now you have made it so diffucult that without constant extras you can't win a level. This used to be my go to game but since you have made it so diffucult I don't enjoy playing. This is supposed to be a game for everyday players not professional gamers.",
            "It was really fun until all of a sudden it got so difficult that I could rarely beat the level without using many boosters or watching videos. I enjoy a challenge and understand they need to make money but it has taken the fun out of it and I'm quitting and deleting the game.",
            "Very addictive game. Fun to play. On level 5200 and it just keeps going."
