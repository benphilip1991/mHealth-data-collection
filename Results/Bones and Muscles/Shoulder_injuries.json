            "i don't write reviewa but this one really made me do it.Its an amazing which is has three qualities:Good Excercises,Less ads and real healing qualities.Thank you Developers for this app.",
            "Well designed and very useful App, I personally injured my shoulder and using this App to recover.",
            "A little background, so you know what I'm using this for: I sustained an overuse injury at work and had to go to phys-therapy for months. The office was far from me, so making time to go in while also working full time was nearly impossible. So I stopped going and quit my job (who had no real empathy and wouldnt listen to doctor's instruction anyway). Now I'm at a new job and getting new injuries because my shoulder was never fully healed and strengthened. But now I had no worker's compensation. Thus decided to start looking up rehabilitation exercises on my own. Mostly I was hitting various websites with pretty good info, but none were as compiled (and portable) as this. Seriously glad this app exists. The sleeper stretch is one of my favourites and the first time I did it I realized just how messed up my shoulder was. Weak too. However, I'm also glad for my experience at the phys-therapist's because I have the tools I need for some of these (such as a resistance band) and I already know how to do some and can apply that knowledge to others. Now if only I could get the massages. LOL",

They give alternatives for people using bands, weights, or no equipment.  The major problem is that the app doesn't show your progress day to day, and doesn't seem to have notifications for the days you are supposed to work. The biggest reason for me to use an app is for motivation and tracking: I can get the exercise techniques elsewhere.

Low back problems, tennis elbow and shoulders tendonitis can become injury factors when improper form is sacrificed to heave heavier weights.\r\n\r\nStand erect when doing shoulders exercises. Do not lean back, and heave the weight, because too much momentum will be involved in the lift and clearly, not enough shoulders action. Keep your elbows close to your side without lifting up the elbows.\r\n\r\nHow many times do we see people in the gym lifting their elbows during these shoulders movements? When the elbows come up there is a loss in resistance due to gravity. Also, when the elbows come up, full extension is lost, so the bottom of the shoulders muscle will not be hit with the movement.\r\n\r\nToo few weightlifters in the gym pay attention to wrist position while performing shoulders lifts. In order to achieve results from shoulders training, emphasis must be kept on this muscle during the lift. But, when the wrist is bent backwards, some emphasis will be taken off the shoulders muscle and shifted to the forearms.\r\n\r\nArnold Schwarzenegger further discusses keeping the emphasis on the shoulders muscle in a discussion of the line of the hand. \"When you do a Curl, you must bring your hand directly up to your shoulder. If you change that line an inch to the inside or the outside, you are taking stress off the shoulders and you won't get the same results.\" 3\r\n\r\nTraining shoulders allows for a great variety of exercises using bars, dumbbells, EZ curl bars, cables, machines and Scott benches. The diversity will allow flexibility in program design allowing your client to achieve the maximum results.\r\n\r\nGenetics can make a champion bodybuilder, but hard work, careful selection of exercises, and good technique can bring a shoulders muscle to its full potential.",

Yes, obviously it's you, unless there's another entry on Google play called injury map which strangely charged my card that I signed up to your app with that I evidently have on my phone... Or I wouldn't be able to post a review, would I? Further it is $79.99 NZ I have been charged. I will happily post pictures.",
            "This is a life changing app that I'd recommend to everyone! Having been through many years of severe lower back issues and visited a range of specialists, only Injurymap has had a significant impact, with its daily activities, check ins after every step, and slow progress towards pain free movements.",

Free access allows you to read the general program description and the 'Tips' section.",

I picked up my shoulder injury by carrying the world on it for too long. I actually picked up my injury from excessive over use. I am a plasterer by trade (used to be) and the constant movement and rotation of my arm in a circular motion weakened the tendons over time.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I had to do was go see a doctor and in my case this was a complete waste of time. I mean, what in god's name is a doctor going to do for my shoulder I ask you...nothing but prescribe some pain killers, and I bloody hate prescription drugs. This is why I set out to get the injury fixed without the need for pill popping and you can too. Natural remedies for shoulder pain was the best option for me, but I must stress, it may not be for you. It all depends on the severity of the condition.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a few things I did to get my shoulder back to its peak performance. Just remember, if the problem persists and you feel the injury is very serious, you should go to a physiotherapist to get it looked at by a professional. If you have little or no money like me then you can try the steps below:\r\n\r\nStretching:\r\n\r\nThe single best solution to start with is to stretch those muscles and joints throughout the day. This has done wonders for my shoulder and I continue to use stretch exercises every day, 5 years on. I haven't had any muscle or joint worries since then so I recommend you buy a good book that teaches the basics of stretching and do those exercises every day from now on.\r\n\r\nHeat:\r\n\r\nIf you are having shoulder trouble (which of course you are) make sure to get a heat pad and place on your shoulder throughout the day. As natural remedies for shoulder pain goes, heat is a great way to determine how serious the injury really is. The heat relaxes your muscles and this alone could be enough to get your joints back to basics. Soaking in a hot bath once in a while can be great to ease any discomfort also. What I'm saying here is that heat is a great indicator to how serious the problem really is.",

        "title": "Shoulder Workouts -30 Effective Shoulder Exercises",
        "description": "To create the looks of large shoulders you need to pick exercises in your shoulder workout that strike the proper muscles. Your shoulder comprises of three muscles...leading deltoid, the medial side deltoid, and the trunk deltoid. It is important to concentrate your shoulder workout mainly around the medial side deltoid if you need to create width.\r\n\r\nWhat Exercises in Your Shoulder Workout Emphasize the Side Deltoid.\r\n\r\nInclude plenty of lateral raise variations in your shoulder workout, if you want to really isolate the side deltoids. Many people choose to start their shoulder workout with shoulder presses, but I favor to begin my shoulder workout with lateral raises. When you begin your shoulder workout with lateral raises you pre-exhaustion your side deltoid muscle tissue. When you strike the shoulder presses, you can completely blast the medial side deltoid muscle groups. When you perform any pressing movements try to preserve your elbows aside of your body. Never let your elbows to drift ahead, as this will place the focus on the front deltoid muscles.\r\n\r\nWhat Exercises You Should Avoid in Your Shoulder Workout.\r\n\r\nThe larger your traps are, the narrower your shoulders can look. I would recommend dropping all shrugging and upright rows from your own shoulder workout. The wide and sq . shoulder look is attained by focus on the deltoid muscles throughout your shoulder workout. I in fact think that big traps create an unattractive turn to the physique and present you a curved shoulder look.\r\n\r\nHow Many Sets and Reps to Perform in Your Shoulder Workout.\r\n\r\nYour shoulder workout will change based on your shoulder development. If you have small shoulders, i quickly would recommend a higher volume method of your shoulder workout. Muscle tissue is increased by carrying out a higher volume of focus on a particular muscle group. If someone has smaller sized shoulders, they should aim to obtain a pump within their shoulders throughout their shoulder workout. That is achieved by performing an increased number of reps and less rest among sets. I'd aim for 15-20 total units for shoulders and adhere to reps in the 8-12 range. For people that have bigger shoulders I'd perform about 1/2 of the quantity of lifts through the shoulder workout. Shoot for 8-10 total models in your shoulder workout and 5-10 reps per set.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo know more about the workouts download this app now.",

        "description": "Sit and stand with proper posture and you will physically look 10 years younger and 10 pounds lighter. Psychologically, good posture conveys confidence, poise and leadership.\r\nUse our App to learn about good posture, poor posture, what causes posture problems and how to fix and improve your posture.\r\n\r\nHow important is correct posture for overall health?\r\nCorrect posture aligns everything in your body. Bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons are all able to function optimally when you sit or stand up straight. Your organs assume their proper placement with good posture.\r\n\r\nThe best way to improve your posture is to focus on exercises that strengthen your core -- the abdominal and low back muscles that connect to your spine and pelvis.\r\n\r\nPosture is the position in which you hold your body upright against gravity while standing, sitting or lying down. Good posture involves training your body to stand, walk, sit and lie in positions where the least strain is placed on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement or weight-bearing activities. Proper posture:\r\n\r\nKeeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are being used properly.\r\nHelps decrease the abnormal wearing of joint surfaces that could result in arthritis.\r\nDecreases the stress on the ligaments holding the joints of the spine together.\r\nPrevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions.\r\nPrevents fatigue because muscles are being used more efficiently, allowing the body to use less energy.\r\nPrevents strain or overuse problems.\r\nPrevents backache and muscular pain.\r\nContributes to a good appearance.\r\n\r\nLiving with bad posture can be a dangerous thing.

        "descriptionHTML": "Sit and stand with proper posture and you will physically look 10 years younger and 10 pounds lighter. Psychologically, good posture conveys confidence, poise and leadership.<br>Use our App to learn about good posture, poor posture, what causes posture problems and how to fix and improve your posture.<br><br>How important is correct posture for overall health?<br>Correct posture aligns everything in your body. Bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons are all able to function optimally when you sit or stand up straight. Your organs assume their proper placement with good posture.<br><br>The best way to improve your posture is to focus on exercises that strengthen your core -- the abdominal and low back muscles that connect to your spine and pelvis.<br><br>Posture is the position in which you hold your body upright against gravity while standing, sitting or lying down. Good posture involves training your body to stand, walk, sit and lie in positions where the least strain is placed on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement or weight-bearing activities. Proper posture:<br><br>Keeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are being used properly.<br>Helps decrease the abnormal wearing of joint surfaces that could result in arthritis.<br>Decreases the stress on the ligaments holding the joints of the spine together.<br>Prevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions.<br>Prevents fatigue because muscles are being used more efficiently, allowing the body to use less energy.<br>Prevents strain or overuse problems.<br>Prevents backache and muscular pain.<br>Contributes to a good appearance.<br><br>Living with bad posture can be a dangerous thing. The muscle and ligament imbalances that result from poor alignment can lead to all sorts of problems:<br><br>Chronic back, neck, and shoulder pain<br>Foot, knee, hip, and back injuries<br>Headaches<br>Stiffness<br>Fatigue<br>Muscle atrophy and weakness<br>Difficulty breathing<br>Digestion issues<br>Impingement and nerve compression<br>Sciatica<br>Carpal tunnel syndrome<br>But we&#39;re going to fix that right now!

Sometimes the stretches and exercises aren't clear as each is just represented with one static illustration so it's not easy to know how to move.

There are some minor inconsistencies as well, like a stretch named 'slide right hand down thigh' that asks you to change sides half way through, then starts over again for the left side. Useful!",

It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

        "title": "Shoulder Workouts Guide",
        "description": "Shoulder Workouts is this app to help have a strong shoulder and Shoulder is often trained while training the upper body. However, bringing out the striation and shape of the shoulder muscles is a big part of the upper body workout. However, first you need to make sure that you have enough muscle mass. Most men spend most of their time in the gym to train their shoulders, but they do not see any progress. Therefore, this article will exclusively explain and show you what are the five best shoulder exercises for masses that men can use to extract the shape and striation of their shoulder muscles. Note that many other exercises exist even though this option seems good for the overall shoulder muscle.\r\n\r\nEspecially, having a strong shoulder will help you improve other forms of exercise such as deadlifts and bench press involving the arm. In order for the shoulders strong enough to support other exercises efficiently it is recommended to follow the exercises\r\n\r\nSo, what a good shoulder training to start?\r\n\r\nArnold's buffer presses - sit and hold a dumbbell in each hand in front of you at the shoulder level, elbows bent and with palms facing you. Lift the dumbbells above your head, rotate them as you lift so that the palm faces outwards in a straight position. Lower the dumbbells again to their original position. Repeat.\r\n\r\nPush forward - you stand with a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing you. Raise one hand straight ahead with the bow until it is above the shoulder height. Lower the dumbbell, and at the same time raise the other hand (both hands move at once). The key point here is smooth movement without arm swing.\r\n\r\nLateral boost, or shoulder flies - you stand with dumbbells in each hand, arms at your sides. Palms inside Lift the dumbbell up and to the head height, hold it, then lower the arm to its original position. Again, avoid swinging your arms. A bent bow, or an inverted fly is a variation of sitting where you are sitting facing down (bending) and lifting the dumbbell so that your arms are parallel to the ground, then moving downwards again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Shoulder exercises\r\n* Training traps\r\n* Deltoid exercise\r\n\r\n\r\nfeatures in this app\r\n\r\n- updated every week\r\n- The tips and secrets we will provide\r\n- Simple view in app\r\n\r\n\r\na little explanation about Shoulder Workouts:\r\n\r\nShoulders are one of the most important muscle groups. Abandoned shoulders give you the advantage of looking much larger than you actually are. The square view will give you a well-trained appearance. In addition, wide shoulders make your waist look smaller. Even so, his shoulder is one of the most abandoned parts of the body. What many people do not understand is that after developing a shoulder will help you build your chest and back muscles faster and better.\r\n\r\nProper shoulder exercises should include exercises for all three shoulders: Front, side and back. There are several exercises to work on each shoulder section.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost shoulder exercises are the shoulder press. They mostly train the front, but if you run the exercises behind your head work on your back. If you are experienced, I would recommend using dumbel. They let you move in a much wider range that helps focus on the contraction itself. For beginners, it's better to use a shoulder engine to get used to moving.\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal exercise for the shoulder and should be included in every shoulder routine. You will get the best results if doing this exercise with dumbbells. We recommend that you start with less weight since doing the movement correctly is very significant.

        "descriptionHTML": "Shoulder Workouts is this app to help have a strong shoulder and Shoulder is often trained while training the upper body. However, bringing out the striation and shape of the shoulder muscles is a big part of the upper body workout. However, first you need to make sure that you have enough muscle mass. Most men spend most of their time in the gym to train their shoulders, but they do not see any progress. Therefore, this article will exclusively explain and show you what are the five best shoulder exercises for masses that men can use to extract the shape and striation of their shoulder muscles. Note that many other exercises exist even though this option seems good for the overall shoulder muscle.<br><br>Especially, having a strong shoulder will help you improve other forms of exercise such as deadlifts and bench press involving the arm. In order for the shoulders strong enough to support other exercises efficiently it is recommended to follow the exercises<br><br>So, what a good shoulder training to start?<br><br>Arnold&#39;s buffer presses - sit and hold a dumbbell in each hand in front of you at the shoulder level, elbows bent and with palms facing you. Lift the dumbbells above your head, rotate them as you lift so that the palm faces outwards in a straight position. Lower the dumbbells again to their original position. Repeat.<br><br>Push forward - you stand with a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing you. Raise one hand straight ahead with the bow until it is above the shoulder height. Lower the dumbbell, and at the same time raise the other hand (both hands move at once). The key point here is smooth movement without arm swing.<br><br>Lateral boost, or shoulder flies - you stand with dumbbells in each hand, arms at your sides. Palms inside Lift the dumbbell up and to the head height, hold it, then lower the arm to its original position. Again, avoid swinging your arms. A bent bow, or an inverted fly is a variation of sitting where you are sitting facing down (bending) and lifting the dumbbell so that your arms are parallel to the ground, then moving downwards again.<br><br><br><br>In this app we will discuss:<br><br><br>* Shoulder exercises<br>* Training traps<br>* Deltoid exercise<br><br><br>features in this app<br><br>- updated every week<br>- The tips and secrets we will provide<br>- Simple view in app<br><br><br>a little explanation about Shoulder Workouts:<br><br>Shoulders are one of the most important muscle groups. Abandoned shoulders give you the advantage of looking much larger than you actually are. The square view will give you a well-trained appearance. In addition, wide shoulders make your waist look smaller. Even so, his shoulder is one of the most abandoned parts of the body. What many people do not understand is that after developing a shoulder will help you build your chest and back muscles faster and better.<br><br>Proper shoulder exercises should include exercises for all three shoulders: Front, side and back. There are several exercises to work on each shoulder section.<br><br>The first and foremost shoulder exercises are the shoulder press. They mostly train the front, but if you run the exercises behind your head work on your back. If you are experienced, I would recommend using dumbel. They let you move in a much wider range that helps focus on the contraction itself. For beginners, it&#39;s better to use a shoulder engine to get used to moving.<br><br>This is an ideal exercise for the shoulder and should be included in every shoulder routine. You will get the best results if doing this exercise with dumbbells. We recommend that you start with less weight since doing the movement correctly is very significant.

        "title": "Upper Body Workout Plan",
        "description": "Do you want to add a serious amount of lean muscle mass in just 30 days? Then you’ve come to the right place because this 4 week, training plan will do exactly that by pushing your body harder than it’s ever been pushed before. \r\n\r\nTo add as much lean muscle mass as possible over the next 30 days, while also stripping off body fat, it’s important you follow this training plan as closely as possible. It’s been designed to tax your major muscle groups, especially your chest and back, to radically transform how you look.\r\n\r\nTypically beginners will often start with a total body workout program, but that isn't the only option, especially if you're on a busy schedule. You can easily split your workouts so that you're working different muscle groups on different days. Your workouts are shorter and will fit into a busy day.\r\n\r\nThis upper body workout is perfect for beginners who want to get started. It includes easy-to-follow classic dumbbell exercises that target all of the muscles of the upper body as well as the core. Included is the muscle group you're working so you can start to learn which moves work which muscles.\r\n\r\nThat will help you focus on that muscle as you're doing the exercise, which makes the move more effective. \r\nThe idea here is to start to build strength and muscle so you can create a strong foundation that will allow you to move on to more challenging workouts. The most effective strategy is to integrate a combination of compound exercises into your routine. Some of those will include barbells and dumbbells and machines, yes, but others just require your own body weight and some call for resistance bands.\r\n\r\nAn upper body workout is any workout that involves training most or all of the muscle groups of the upper body. This includes:\r\n- Chest\r\n- Back\r\n- Shoulders\r\n- Biceps\r\n- Triceps\r\n\r\nProgressing your bodyweight workouts by adding resistance, like a set of dumbbells, is a great way to further challenge yourself and build stronger muscles. Even though the exercises primarily target muscles in the upper body, they will also engage your core abs.\r\n\r\nWe have the 50 best upper body exercises and strength-training moves, which will target and trigger muscle growth as fast as possible. Not only will these moves increase your overall strength, but they will decrease your risk of injury, create a more symmetrical build, and will naturally improve your core strength for everyday functional fitness.",

Flexibility training.\r\nStretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.\r\nTight muscles can cause undue strain on the neighboring joints during normal daily function, or they themselves can become injured,\" Sasha Cyrelson, D.P.T., clinical director at Professional Physical Therapy in Sicklerville, New Jersey, tells SELF. As we age, our muscles get shorter and less elastic, she adds. \"We need to take an active role in maintaining and improving the length of our muscles so we can continue to enjoy our abilities without pain.\r\nStanding Hamstring Stretch.\r\nStand tall with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, arms by your sides.Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lowering your head toward floor, while keeping your head, neck and shoulders relaxed.Wrap your arms around backs of your legs and hold anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.Bend your knees and roll up when you're done.\r\nPiriformis Stretch\r\n\r\nThe piriformis muscle is a deep internal hip rotator, located on the outside of the butt. Its primary role is external rotation, Atkins says. \"Deep internal rotators, while small, produce a lot of the movement at the hip and are often overlooked.Since the piriformis crosses over the sciatic nerve, \"if it is tight, it can result in sciatic nerve irritation, Cyrelson says. Stretching this muscle can prevent potential future sciatica, or help treat it.\r\nLunge With Spinal Twist\r\n\r\nAtkins notes that this stretch is commonly referred to as the World's Greatest Stretch (WGS) in the fitness community. And for good reason: \"It's essential to help with posture-related pain or for people who sit for prolonged periods of time,\" says Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., cofounder of Bespoke Treatments Physical Therapy in New York City and Seattle. \"It helps open your hips and improve thoracic (mid-back) mobility,\" he tells SELF.\r\nFigure Four Stretch\r\n\r\n\"This specifically stretches the piriformis and iliopsoas muscles (essentially your hip rotator and flexor muscles) and the IT band. Because of this and the passive nature of the pose, it is an excellent and gentle approach to helping relieve symptoms associated with sciatica and knee pain,\" John Murray, yoga instructor and co-founder of Lyons Den Power Yoga, tells SELF.\r\n90/90 Stretch\r\n\r\nThis modification of pigeon pose helps with internal rotation of one leg and external rotation of the other, \"so you're hitting both movements of the hip at once,\" Atkins says. It's a good option for people who have extremely tight hip flexors, she adds. \"The front thigh is safely on the ground in a position that doesn't cause too much stress.\"\r\nFrog Stretch\r\n\r\n\"Most of us sit and cross our legs, which can lead to tight hips and result in lower-back pain,\" Lacee Lazoff, a NASM-certified personal trainer and instructor at the Fhitting Room in New York City, tells SELF. \"This stretch directly target tights spots in the hips/groin and is especially useful for runners.\"",

To have variety you need to increase the minutes of the stretch session. The other problem is that the app suddenly ends the session when using it, this have been happening for some time. It may happen when I almost finish the session or in the middle of it. Overall good app for stretching and far better than many others out there.",

It's hard to keep training when you're hurt, but it's really important not to stop to recover faster.\r\nIf for any reason you cannot stand, it does not mean you have to give up your healthy amount of daily physical activity.\r\n\r\nSitting Cardio features exercises for the upper body that will tone your arms, shoulders, pectorals and back, but at the same time will make you sweat and burn calories.\r\n\r\nExercising the upper body is also known to help eliminating excess liquids from the lower body, so don’t worry if you can’t use your legs muscles for a while, these workouts will keep you fit until you can walk and exercise your full body again.\r\n\r\nYou can do these exercises while sitting on the bed or on a comfortable chair without armrests. \r\n\r\nYou will burn calories, tone your arms and increase blood circulation, also improving drainage in the lower body.\r\n\r\nThese workouts can be handy even if you don’t have problems but you feel more tired than usual and prefer to train sitting down. \r\n\r\nI tried to make the exercises fun but effective.

            "I just downloaded this app, and I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on many issues. First of all, I have MS, and I was looking for an app that will work my abs while sitting down. This app does not do this at all. It mainly works the arms. Then it does not have a voice magnetism at all only the music. You have to watch the screen to know what is next and how to do it. At hee end, the app stopped working. I am definitely uninstalling. Looking for another app for the abs.",
            "I love this app! I lost my entire left leg and have gone from an independent, active person to someone who has to rely on another for 80% of daily activities. This app has given me hope and encouragement that, even though life has totally changed, I can be active and feel positive about myself and what life will turn out to be!! THANKU SO VERY MUCH",
            "My daughter is very weak and problems standing. This app is wonderful, I just wish the exercises model moved a little slower. Thanks",
            "This was great for me. I haven't been able to get any excercises in for a long time due to health issues. I actually broke out in a serious sweat. Thanx for having this app",
            "Love this! I am recovering from double knee surgery and needed to find a way of exercising without causing pain or damage to my knees. My hear rate was raised and it's really fun to do ! Obviously the more effort you put in, the more you're going to get out of it"

        "description": "Check out these  great exercises to strengthen your knees so you can enjoy your day-to-day activities with less pain, popping and stopping.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to develop stronger knees and ward off future injuries is to build strong, fluid and solid muscles around the knees and in your legs and core.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating precise knee stretches and targeted exercise for knee pain into your routine, you can revamp and enhance the strength of those achy knees that have been bothering you for years.\r\nSit on a table or desk with your legs hanging freely, and place a thin pad under your knee, so that the knee is slightly higher than the hip. Extend the knee slowly with the foot flexed, until the leg is extended; hold 3-5 seconds, and then lower slowly under control. Do 10 repetitions and repeat with the other leg. You can do 2-3 sets as needed.\r\nAs you get stronger, you can add light ankle weights to increase the resistance. Your kneecaps will love you for this one! Your hamstring muscles will also get an excellent stretch in the process, as you strengthen your quads.\r\nStand on a 2 inch board or small step. Keeping your thigh in a straight line with the upper body, bend your knee to a 90 degree angle and slowly lower down. Keep your foot flexed throughout the movement. You can keep your thigh pressed against a table, to ensure that it stays in line with your trunk.\r\nDo 10 repetitions, and repeat with the other leg. You can do 2-3 sets as needed.\r\n\r\nAs you get stronger, you can add light ankle weights to increase the resistance. In this exercise, your hamstring muscles get stronger, while you stretch out your quads.\r\nStand with your head, back and hips against a wall, your feet about hip-width apart. Slowly bend your knees, and glide down the wall until just before you reach a sitting position. Hold the position for five to ten seconds and then slowly come up. Repeat 5-10 times as needed.\r\nYou should keep your abdominal muscles engaged and not allow your pelvis to slide down lower than your knees. Avoid bringing the knees forward over the toes.\r\n\r\nThis quadriceps exercise will strengthen your knee joint and build stamina along the entire leg.\r\nBy strengthening the muscles around your knee, you’ll be able to relieve the regular strain placed on the knee joint. With less stress on the knee, you’ll be able to boost your chances to relieve pain and avoid further injury.\r\n\r\nAs with all things, action is the key. It’s crucial to make time in our busy schedules to devote to improving our joints and bodies. Investing just fifteen minutes a day can provide a great payoff for your quality of life down the road.\r\n\r\nA final note: the term ‘no pain, no gain’ is outdated and obsolete. You should never experience sharp or shooting pain when engaging in the above exercises. If you do, modify your position or consult your doctor or a physical therapist.\r\n\r\nStrength and flexibility go hand-in-hand: a fluid muscle is a happy muscle. Knee exercises and stretches that promote both power and flexibility are of the greatest benefit. Knee strengthening exercises develop the muscles around the knee, but they can also cause the muscles to get tight, if not stretched properly. A tight muscle will constrict the knee joint and be more prone to injury. Stretching after knee strengthening exercise will alleviate muscle soreness and keep the muscles long and elastic.",

            "A decent stretching app. I like especially the four week programs. There are a few issues, however: The rest screen hides the next excercise so it's hard to prepare for it. Also, you cannot navigate back or forth during the rest period making it slow to get back on track if you touch the back button by accident. Some excercises don't really have instruction on how to do them, just some words how 'beneficial' they are. Would also help if one could pause the timer and go read the instructions.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

        "description": "Are you are looking for bodyweight workouts and exercises?  Then you came to the right place!\r\n\r\nCan bodyweight workouts actually build muscles?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts really burn fat?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts increase stability?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts truly build strength?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts be done at home?\r\n\r\nThe answer to all of these questions is……YES! \r\n\r\nYou can achieve amazing results with bodyweight workouts!\r\n\r\nDownload our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app and we will show you how.\r\n\r\nWe have warm ups, stretching routines, exercises, and workouts for every fitness level, from beginners to advanced athletes.\r\n\r\nWe offer effective training and workout plans that are designed to achieve efficient results. Our training plans contain an optimal balance of high intensity, endurance, and strength building workouts; and all of our workout plans incorporate an optimal level of rest days.\r\n\r\nOur exercises are bodyweight focused, and require proper form in order to achieve optimal results. That is why we spent over a year developing high-quality exercise animations, which visually illustrate the proper form for each exercise.  \r\n\r\nThe key to exercising is to create balance by training your entire body, including chest, arms, abdominals, shoulders, back, and legs.  Creating this balance promotes stability and reduces risk of injury.\r\nFor example, one of the key components to core stability is strength in the glutes, a body part often neglected by men.  Martial Arts fighters train glutes to build stability in their hips in order to improve internal rotation.  On the other hand, weak glutes may increase the risk of developing low back or knee pain.  Our app focuses on balanced full body workouts and training plans in order to help optimize your fitness level and minimize your risk of injury.\r\n Our workouts are easy to follow, and are based on time and number of repetitions.  Since balance is the key, we offer a variety of workouts including full body workouts, upper body workouts, lower body workouts, and workouts based on individual muscle groups.\r\n\r\nMany people do not realize the benefits of stretching. Stretching promotes flexibility which helps maintain a full range of motion in the joints.  Our workouts start with a short warm up and stretching in order to help you achieve this benefit.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in burning fat and building strength is eating properly.  Our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app contains a variety of high quality nutrition plans, such as plans for vegetarians, plans for athletes with fast metabolisms, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe want you to have the best user experience possible.  Our app includes features such as:\r\n\r\n💪 Easy-to-follow workouts \r\n💪 A Calorie counter\r\n💪 Transformation images\r\n💪 Data backed up on the cloud\r\n💪 A Weight tracker\r\n💪 High-quality exercise animations\r\n💪 An Achievement system with badges\r\n💪 Reminders to always be on time with your workout\r\n💪 Filters for content\r\n💪 A Workout/Training plan tracking system\r\n💪 Availability in 18 Languages\r\n💪 and much more...\r\n\r\n\r\nTry our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app and get results in as little as 20 days!

Then you came to the right place!<br><br>Can bodyweight workouts actually build muscles?<br>Can bodyweight workouts really burn fat?<br>Can bodyweight workouts increase stability?<br>Can bodyweight workouts truly build strength?<br>Can bodyweight workouts be done at home?<br><br>The answer to all of these questions is……YES! <br><br>You can achieve amazing results with bodyweight workouts!<br><br>Download our Summer Bodyweight Workouts &amp; Exercises app and we will show you how.<br><br>We have warm ups, stretching routines, exercises, and workouts for every fitness level, from beginners to advanced athletes.<br><br>We offer effective training and workout plans that are designed to achieve efficient results. Our training plans contain an optimal balance of high intensity, endurance, and strength building workouts; and all of our workout plans incorporate an optimal level of rest days.<br><br>Our exercises are bodyweight focused, and require proper form in order to achieve optimal results. That is why we spent over a year developing high-quality exercise animations, which visually illustrate the proper form for each exercise.  <br><br>The key to exercising is to create balance by training your entire body, including chest, arms, abdominals, shoulders, back, and legs.  Creating this balance promotes stability and reduces risk of injury.<br>For example, one of the key components to core stability is strength in the glutes, a body part often neglected by men.  Martial Arts fighters train glutes to build stability in their hips in order to improve internal rotation.  On the other hand, weak glutes may increase the risk of developing low back or knee pain.  Our app focuses on balanced full body workouts and training plans in order to help optimize your fitness level and minimize your risk of injury.<br> Our workouts are easy to follow, and are based on time and number of repetitions.  Since balance is the key, we offer a variety of workouts including full body workouts, upper body workouts, lower body workouts, and workouts based on individual muscle groups.<br><br>Many people do not realize the benefits of stretching. Stretching promotes flexibility which helps maintain a full range of motion in the joints.  Our workouts start with a short warm up and stretching in order to help you achieve this benefit.<br><br>Another important factor in burning fat and building strength is eating properly.  Our Summer Bodyweight Workouts &amp; Exercises app contains a variety of high quality nutrition plans, such as plans for vegetarians, plans for athletes with fast metabolisms, and many more.<br><br>We want you to have the best user experience possible.  Our app includes features such as:<br><br>💪 Easy-to-follow workouts <br>💪 A Calorie counter<br>💪 Transformation images<br>💪 Data backed up on the cloud<br>💪 A Weight tracker<br>💪 High-quality exercise animations<br>💪 An Achievement system with badges<br>💪 Reminders to always be on time with your workout<br>💪 Filters for content<br>💪 A Workout/Training plan tracking system<br>💪 Availability in 18 Languages<br>💪 and much more...<br><br><br>Try our Summer Bodyweight Workouts &amp; Exercises app and get results in as little as 20 days!  What are you waiting for, start your journey today!<br><br>Please reach out to us any time via email at support@spartan-apps.com if you have any questions or feedback.",

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",

To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

            "This update will give you seizures. I have no idea what you are thinking Response: when running. The screen appears to be twitching more than the character running. Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck 🤗 And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "This is a good app with 3 complimentary workout programs in the free version. I am doing the basic. I like it so thought I'd get the premium as it promises 50 extra workouts. I thought, maybe a morning routine, nighttime routine, neck stretch routine etc. 50 should cover all bases. Great! But don't be fooled by the terminology. I paid for premium and there is still only 3 workouts. I can't see any different between free and paid. Did they mean up to 50 extra exercises? Disappointed.",
            "The measurements aren't realistic for everyone. My split measurement was 17 my husband's was 25. The highest you have is 11. It also wouldn't allow me to put 0 in for the side measurement even though it's an option. I would love to see a stretching app for specific sports too.",

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I used to play this before and i just dowloaded it again. But there is a glitch. You cant get past level 5 which is the shield boss. Once u die on the level, the robot comes to save you and it is supposed to kill the zombie but now, the robot causes no damage. Had to delete the game because clearly there is a bug.",
            "So far it s a great game, i am now at stage 400+, but there is something i want to request... regarding the green chip and blue chip, my weapon are already legend and can only be step up using only yellow, pink and colorful chip to become mythic.. my green and blue chip are useless.. so can you please put an NPC that i can trade a certain amount of green to become blue chip then blue into yellow and so on, so that those chip still be useful. Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",
            "Fun game IF REWARD VIDEO was AVAILABLE. I don't care if it isn't available give me the reward without the video... I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",
            "When I try to get triple reward, open chests or anything that requires opening an ad; it says REWARDED video is not ready. I also made a purchase but did not get the secondary weapon!!! Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

The previews of each adjustment is handy. The dehaze seems to work far better within PsX? It's never made more sense until now. I've been using Photoshop for decades, I've got my issues with Adobe, but I'm really liking this app.",

It doesn't allow you to fake anything with pictures like regular Photoshop. It just let's you adjust what's there which is exactly what I wanted. No fake beauty standards here! Just real photography editing.",
            "Just starting to use this app. Other than 1 crash I had trying to create a collage (hoping there are'nt any more crashes etc...) the app itself is neat, seems easy to use, a small learning curve and easy to navigate. The app was obviously designed for the average person who hasn't got a lot of time to learn how to use a complicated and professional grade photo editing app. Although...I can see a professional photographer using this app. Lots of good bells and whistles. Well done Adobe👍🏼!",
            "At first, I didn't know which app I could use to edit my photos, as I am a new born in photograph life, but this app gave me the best of the best. But my problem is that the very same app I enjoy does not allow me to watermark the photos, therefore I have optioned to watermark my photos using my mobil phone, otherwise I am happy with this app. I can recommend it to a new baby on photograph world"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "This is the 100% Reliable Printing App to Use, Instead of Your Manufacturers App! If you are lookn' for an app, that will work with any printer, that you use at home and maybe, for your work, this app from Mopria, will work for you! 100% for most printers from Brother♾Epson♾HP♾Etc...So, if you cannot find the right plugin or app, try Mopria! It will work, for you!",
            "I love this app it always find my printer when my actual printer name with his brothers black and white printer and and sometimes it won't find it but mopia print all always locate my brother's black and white printer I love this app is great it deserves more than a five star in my opinion I have no problem with it and it's so easy to use thank you very much. I'm very satisfied user,",
            "Only 5 minutes ago (12.40 hrs) I downloaded this app, because my new Huawei p20 Pro was not printing, but I was able to print the same item using my laptop. I have the HP 5520 all in one printer, I printed off the test page which printed BLANK! GOOD START. I have just tried another 2 different prints, both blank pages.. That's from 9/10/18, not used the printer for a while 6 months at least, same bloody thing, no printer, yet it's on your listing, rint page = chuck out blank pages , uninstalled",
            "Used to be awesome Update killed my canon mf240. Support only offered a canned response. Thought it was the phone, tried a brand new phone with the same result... It was fine till the update, nothing wrong on my end. It will connect and recognize the printer over WiFi and direct-connection but when you get to the print screen the icon to start print (blue printer icon) is gone!! Checked print services, cleared cache, all should be well and it's not!! Please fix!!!",
            "Been using this app both on my fire tablet and for the last few days on my Moto G5. It appears to be working VERY well on both devices. Does everything that I want. 5*. Update: Some months later. This app is still working well and has caused no problems at all. Thoroughly recommend."

I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

I would just use a yoga app of I wanted to do a handstand people are looking for a well rounded strength like a gymnast would have and you can't achieve that without any pulling, or rings, or lever work. Send me an email if you add these things I'd be happy to re subscribe if there was more",

It helps you learn stuff earlier and shows how to get in your position that you need to get in and gets you ready for competition. This app is amazing and show your friends and family . AMAZE",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

However, there are a number of reasons that can be responsible for this.\r\n\r\nInjury in the form of fall or blow to the neck area can lead to a stiffness in the neck. The nerves between the shoulder and the neck are injured in such situations and can manifest itself in the form of neck stiffness.\r\n\r\nA condition called radiculopathy occurs due to repetitive stress on the neck or continued bad posture, resulting in pain in the neck muscles.\r\n\r\nDiagnosing A Stiff Neck\r\n\r\nIn most cases, except for serious ailments like spinal stenosis, the most common form of relieving stiffness in the neck is to correct your posture and take proper rest. However, in a world where time is a luxury most cannot afford, most people would run to the nearest dispensary and get themselves a pain relief ointment. But the question here is, whether the ointment is actually a cure for stiff neck or whether it makes way for future ailments?\r\n\r\nConsidering that most commercial pain relief medicines contain chemicals like toluene, dioxane, parabens, etc. the long-term effects of using such medicine easily weigh out the short-term relief they provide.\r\n\r\nMost available ointments for this ailment have other nasty side effects like bad odor and may cause rashes or inflammation on the skin.\r\n\r\nDownload the app to know Cures For Stiff Neck The Natural Way",

            "Been my favorite \"go-to\" photo editing app. Wish there was the same features for videos. But I dont take many of those. So I don't mind keeping it strictly to photo edits. My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

Update October 28: Now you can't even upload pics because it's says the permissions are incorrect, even though they are correct. How useful is a dating app that won't let you upload pics?",
            "Nothing free about this, from the moment you sign up, they're trying to pry your wallet open. You can't see who likes you or who is messaging you (unless they're paying). If you want to do a subscription service, just do a subscription service. Don't tell people it's free when it's not. Even the worst freemium apps give you some time, but this app hits you with a paywall within 30 mins of signing up. The other dating apps are bad, but this is the worst of the lot.",
            "From 5 stars to one! The latest version is so buggy as to be almost unusable. It takes now takes an inordinate amount of time to go from Alerts to Carousel, and from writing a message back to a picture. Writing a message does not show up in a timely manner. More errors exist but you get the idea. Do yourselves a favor, reissue the previous version!",
            "I have just paid £25 for a months subscription which is supposed to include unlimited messages but other than \"liking\" someone's profile I can't send any written messages. Also just found out the \"liking\" is also limited to a certain number a day & everything I try to do I am hit with a upgrade message wanting more money from me. Is £25 for the month not enough for you? Obviously not because for that £25 I have nothing!",
            "Downloaded the app and tried to sign up. I got a message that said \"the action could not be completed at this time\" so I tried again only to be told that I had already signed up. I tried to reset the password I was never allowed to create and received an email that had two different link that took me to blank pages that never loaded."

            "This game is horrible! There is ads for EVERYTHING!!! You have to watch an ad after every level, and the graphics are absolutely disgusting! I would never recommend this game. I did one piercing and I am uninstalling!! If I could rate this game lower than one star, TRUST ME!! This would have a negative 1000 star rating! Never again!",
            "This game is an absolute joke. To many ads, and even if you pass on the upgrades it will still play at least one ad after every level some times more. You spend more time watching ads then you do playing the game. I've only done 3 piercings and I will be deleting this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",
            "This was a huge disappointment the game itself is a great design but after doing 2 people the game wigs out and makes it where you cant see anything so you have to close the app and reopen it , and not to mention when you're in the middle of doing something and then an add pops up not before or after no in the middle. Needs alot of work",
            "Everything is very far off from where your finger actually is on the screen. You have to watch ads to do literally anything in the game, and, on top of those ads you have to watch to progress, you also get random ones too. I get that they need ads to make money, but this is ridiculous. Why have games come to this?",
            "Yeah everybody's right about this game is way too many ads nobody should get this game cuz there's so much else you can't even play the game I got past the first episode then there's that and then I couldn't afford that because the video was so long and then I had to watch another ad before I picked it a different ear piercing and another add another another"

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

Incorrect form hinders progress because it leads to injury. Low back problems, tennis elbow and biceps tendonitis can become injury factors when improper form is sacrificed to heave heavier weights.\r\n\r\nStand erect when doing biceps exercises. Do not lean back, and heave the weight, because too much momentum will be involved in the lift and clearly, not enough biceps action. Keep your elbows close to your side without lifting up the elbows.\r\n\r\nHow many times do we see people in the gym lifting their elbows during these biceps movements? When the elbows come up there is a loss in resistance due to gravity. Also, when the elbows come up, full extension is lost, so the bottom of the biceps muscle will not be hit with the movement.\r\n\r\nToo few weightlifters in the gym pay attention to wrist position while performing biceps lifts. In order to achieve results from biceps training, emphasis must be kept on this muscle during the lift. But, when the wrist is bent backwards, some emphasis will be taken off the biceps muscle and shifted to the forearms.\r\n\r\nArnold Schwarzenegger further discusses keeping the emphasis on the biceps muscle in a discussion of the line of the hand. \"When you do a Curl, you must bring your hand directly up to your shoulder. If you change that line an inch to the inside or the outside, you are taking stress off the biceps and you won't get the same results.\" 3\r\n\r\nTraining biceps allows for a great variety of exercises using bars, dumbbells, EZ curl bars, cables, machines and Scott benches. The diversity will allow flexibility in program design allowing your client to achieve the maximum results.\r\n\r\nGenetics can make a champion bodybuilder, but hard work, careful selection of exercises, and good technique can bring a biceps muscle to its full potential.",

And how to use offensive gripfighting to control the pace of the match and set up your own attacks. \r\n\r\nThe gripfighting techniques taught in this app apply both to standing work and on the ground. This means once you learn a technique you can use it in both contexts. \r\n\r\nIn this app Emily and Stephan ALSO share their collection of must-know, must-do grappling drills.\r\n\r\nThese sports-specific drills will strengthen your body, prepare you for training, and prevent injuries. Most importantly these drills allow you to easily perform lots of repetitions in an easy and efficient manner. Repetition leads to mastery.  With these drills you'll have a ton of reps under your belt in no time. \r\n\r\nLarger grapplers often just use their their strength, size and weight advantages to overpower you. It's very frustrating to get pinned and smothered by a less skilful opponent whose only advantage is having 10 (or 50) lbs of additional muscle. \r\n\r\nBig guys often just 'bench press' their way out of bad positions. If you try this not only will it be ineffective but it will leave your arms limp, drained, and feeling completely powerless. \r\n\r\nPlus it's scary when big guys don't know how to control their strength and weight, and have no clue how to train with smaller people. Injuries are often caused by Sasquatch-like grapplers who go totally 'agro' when their egos are threatened. \r\n\r\nIn this series of apps you'll have two Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belts show you the techniques and strategies to defeat even the biggest, strongest, scariest attackers on the ground. Crazy speed, flexibility, or athleticism are NOT required; the emphasis is on staying safe and preventing injuries at all times. \r\n\r\nEmily is a multiple time BJJ world champion, both with and without the gi. She's taught and worked with thousands of grapplers of all levels. \r\n\r\nStephan Kesting is a BJJ black belt who has been training in the martial arts for over 30 years and is the founder Grapplearts.com. \r\n\r\nFEATURES \r\n~ 1 hour and 39 minutes of solid, filler-free, video instruction \r\n~ Professionally filmed and edited \r\n~ Complete menus for easy navigation \r\n~ Create a list of your favourite techniques and drills using our one-click 'favourite' feature \r\n~ Download the entire app to your phone or iPad; an internet connection is NOT required to view the videos \r\n~ BONUS: 'The Roadmap for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu' book for free! \r\n\r\nINDEX \r\n1) Intro to Defeating Bigger Opponents \r\n2) Why You Should Drill \r\n3) Fundamental Drills \r\n4) Breakfalls \r\n5) Technical stand-up \r\n6) Forward Breakfall \r\n7) Backward Roll \r\n8) Shrimping \r\n9) Leg Circles \r\n10) Leg Triangles \r\n11) Grappler's Lifts \r\n12) Advanced Drills \r\n13) Scoot Forward \r\n14) Scoot Backward \r\n15) Shrimping Forward \r\n16) Four Point Rotation \r\n17) Kickouts \r\n18) Spidermans \r\n19) Jumping Lunges \r\n20) Partner Drills \r\n21) Leg Switching on Hips \r\n22) Wheelbarrow Forwards \r\n23) Crab Walk \r\n24) Granby Roll \r\n25) Leap Frogs \r\n26) Drag with Sleeves \r\n27) Bear Walk \r\n28) Butterfly Lifts \r\n29) Jumping Guard Sit Ups \r\n30) Hook Walk \r\n31) Guard Pop-ups \r\n32) Introduction to Gripfighting \r\n33) Four Fingers In \r\n34) Pistol Grip \r\n35) Lapel and Sleeve \r\n36) Common Mistakes \r\n37) Guidelines \r\n38) Stripping Sleeve Grips \r\n39) Stripping Lapel Grips \r\n40) Stripping Elbow Grips \r\n41) Stripping Over the Shoulder Grips \r\n42) Stripping Grips on the Ground \r\n43) Stripping Leg Grips \r\n44) Demo & Summary \r\n45) No Gi Grip Fighting",

Even then, the ad doesn't close. So there's literally no way to get to the editor.",

The pop-up ads for other apps are annoying, but it's a free app, so perhaps shouldn't complain - but it typically takes 10+ clicks to exit the App.",

I'm really happy but..I gavi it 4 stars because it would be great to not have the watermark there. I mean if I'm gonna post it then I wouldn't want anybody calling me out for body editing. I mean yeah I can just crop the watermark out but, still. I think that if ya'll remove the watermark then I will give it 5 stars, and if u want 5 stars you should remove it 😊"

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",
            "This app used 5 gb of my data from the background. I haven't even opened the app over a month but it's running in the background for some reason and takes up a lot of your data.",
            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",
            "Yelp has gotten worse then GOOGLE search when it comes to searching for the nearest business you search for. Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

In such a situation, people do not pay attention to their health and the resultant body becomes the home of small diseases. Even if these diseases seem normal, but take it seriously afterward. Headache is also one of these diseases. Many times the headache gets so high that people start taking up the headache medication. Later these drugs have a bad effect. Therefore, it is better to take medication that home remedies for headache are made. Today in this article we are telling you home remedies for headache and headache.\r\nWhat is headache?\r\nBefore knowing the symptoms of headache, it is important to know what is the headache and what is its symptoms? Headache is the human nervous system i.e. the nervous system and the neck related problems. Usually when you undergo any emotional or physical stress, then this problem appears as a physical reaction. In such a situation, not only the head, but the neck and the back also cause pain. Nowadays the headache is a very common problem, but if the meditation is not given during the time, then this problem can increase.\r\n1. Tension headache\r\n\r\nThis is the most common headache. In this type of headache, the person feels the acute pain on both sides of his head, like someone is pressing the rubber band from both sides. Due to such headaches, neck and shoulder muscles become very tight and feel swollen.\r\nReason: This kind of pain is caused by stress, lack of sleep or injury to the head.\r\nNote: Stress-related headaches can also be exposed to cold air. When the winter comes and the cold air moves or the air comes in contact with the air condition, when the air appears on your neck and head, this condition can also be a headache. Physiotherapy can be quite beneficial in tension headache .\r\n2. Migraine\r\nThe pain in migraine occurs on one side of the head, which is also called alfalfa. In this headache, the patient may have trouble with nausea, vomiting and light. In this, the patient feels pain like sticking something in the head.\r\n\r\nCauses: This headache can be due to the sharp aroma, changes in gold currency, changes in hormones, consumption of alcohol, stress or even loud noise.\r\nNote: Apart from this, this headache is also done with the consumption of certain foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, fruit of groundnut and citrus.\r\n3. Cluster headache\r\nThis type of headache is quite acute and painful. Cluster headaches can occur several times in a day, but do not occur for a long time. Sometimes it starts at any one time, like - if it starts in the morning, then for some time it will be in the morning only. This pain can occur at one side of the head and one eye, because it also affects the nerve of the face.\r\nReason: It can be due to heat, exhaustion, smoking, alcohol intake and more or faster light.",

In this type of headache, the person feels the acute pain on both sides of his head, like someone is pressing the rubber band from both sides. Due to such headaches, neck and shoulder muscles become very tight and feel swollen.<br>Reason: This kind of pain is caused by stress, lack of sleep or injury to the head.<br>Note: Stress-related headaches can also be exposed to cold air. When the winter comes and the cold air moves or the air comes in contact with the air condition, when the air appears on your neck and head, this condition can also be a headache. Physiotherapy can be quite beneficial in tension headache .<br>2. Migraine<br>The pain in migraine occurs on one side of the head, which is also called alfalfa. In this headache, the patient may have trouble with nausea, vomiting and light. In this, the patient feels pain like sticking something in the head.<br><br>Causes: This headache can be due to the sharp aroma, changes in gold currency, changes in hormones, consumption of alcohol, stress or even loud noise.<br>Note: Apart from this, this headache is also done with the consumption of certain foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, fruit of groundnut and citrus.<br>3. Cluster headache<br>This type of headache is quite acute and painful. Cluster headaches can occur several times in a day, but do not occur for a long time. Sometimes it starts at any one time, like - if it starts in the morning, then for some time it will be in the morning only. This pain can occur at one side of the head and one eye, because it also affects the nerve of the face.<br>Reason: It can be due to heat, exhaustion, smoking, alcohol intake and more or faster light.",

            "My experience with BiA is just awesome, you guys are the best when it comes to mobile games. Graphics are phenomenal and the game play is splendid, this review is not just for BiA but also for other games under Gameloft, but my grievance is why is it that most of your games has to be played online? Please and please work on that, am already spreading the word about you guys. So keep up the good work, thanx",
            "I really liked the game so very much,the graphics are pretty good including the controlls but it seems we players are having the same problem here which is getting our weapons upgraded with little resources,i was hoping maybe u can work on that. I was also thinking maybe in ur next upgrade you could add in a mutiplayer mission,where players can work together to accomplish a mission. Thanks for your time",
            "This is the best war game avalable on mobile ever!i would reccomend this to anyone but the reason i rate it a 4 syar is cuz the stuffs are quite expensive and multiplayer battles are not even.i went to the multiplayer battle as a begainner and everyone mannage to kill me with 1 shot... Keep up the good work and ill be waitin for ur next update.",
            "I just got a new phone, and after installing, it brought me up to the level i was on my old phone, (which is good), the bad news is that it didn't unlock some of the guns i already unlocked... like the SMG, which is unlocked from the first level. Now I can't advance cos I need an SMG for my next mission, so I'm basically stuck. If this isn't corrected soon, I'll have to uninstall. Fix this and I'll give you the five stars the game actually deserves"

The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer.

If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",

Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",

Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day.

            "so satisfying and relaxing game. it's all features are very good. we can give it any shape. we can create it as we want. but sometimes I get bored. anyways but I like it more. keep going like this. I wish this game goes more ahead. so actually I like this game so much.",
            "The idea is great and someone recommended it to me for relaxation. But when I installed it there was only one or 2 features. I totally respect if the designers want compensation for their app, it's totally their right. But giving us the option of a free trial version with no real features bothered me a lot.",
            "I like this game very much. We can sell too. I made many pots. This game is relaxing. Painting the pot is the one I like much more. Many tools. But after some days it asked me to download another app. I thought to buy handles but I can't buy. I should download it with money. But whatever, I like this game very much.",
            "With pottery lite I feel like I am doing real pottery. There are so many colours features and designs that you could try and it's so good. I really love the noise, it's like being in a forest or in a quiet place. I love the thing where the screen turns to wherever we turn. It's amazing.",
            "I think it is a absolutely fantastic experience. And when aunt chole's email came that is the best part of the game feels like that in real selling the pots made by our own but ya i had complaint with the developer that u shouldn't asked us to buy why can't we have it free pls make it free full version then I'll give u all 5 stars...🙏"

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

        "description": "Flexibility exercise is one of the four types of exercise along with strength, balance and endurance.\r\n\r\nMany people think stretching is essential to improving flexibility. Runners stretch their hamstrings before hitting the pavement, gymnasts do hyper-splits during their warm-ups and yogis wind down their practice with some forward bends.\r\n\r\nFlexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay flexible. These exercises may not improve your endurance or strength, but being flexible gives you more freedom of movement for other exercise as well as for your everyday activities. It may also help you avoid discomfort when confined in a space for a long period of time (like a long meeting or a plane flight).\r\n\r\nStretching may help you:\r\n\r\n✓ Improve your joint range of motion\r\n✓ Improve your athletic performance\r\n✓ Decrease your risk of injury\r\n\r\nBenefits of stretching\r\n\r\n✓ Improve your performance in physical activities\r\n✓ Decrease your risk of injuries\r\n✓ Help your joints move through their full range of motion\r\n✓ Enable your muscles to work most effectively\r\n\r\nStretching also increases blood flow to the muscle. You may learn to enjoy the ritual of stretching before or after hitting the trail, ballet floor or soccer field.\r\n\r\nWhen should I stretch?\r\n\r\nThe best time to do flexibility exercises is when your muscles are already warm so they can stretch farther without tightness or pain. If you’re doing only stretching exercises, warm up with a few minutes of easy walking first to warm up your muscles. If you’re doing endurance or strength exercises, stretch after, not before.\r\n\r\nApplication сontains:\r\n\r\n1. Neck Exercises\r\n2. Shoulders Arms Exercises\r\n3. Chest Exercises\r\n4. Back Exercises\r\n5. Hips Exercises\r\n6. Torso Exercises\r\n7. ABS Exercises\r\n8. Quadriceps Exercises\r\n9. Hamstrings Exercises\r\n10. Lower Legs Exercises\r\n11. Total Body Exercises\r\n\r\nKnow when to exercise caution\r\n\r\nIf you have a chronic condition or an injury, you might need to adjust your stretching techniques. For example, if you already have a strained muscle, stretching it may cause further harm. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about the most appropriate way to stretch if you have any health concerns.\r\n\r\nAlso remember that stretching doesn't mean you can't get injured. Stretching, for instance, won't prevent an overuse injury.",

Then you came to the right place!\r\n\r\nCan bodyweight workouts actually build muscles?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts really burn fat?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts increase stability?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts truly build strength?\r\nCan bodyweight workouts be done at home?\r\n\r\nThe answer to all of these questions is……YES! \r\n\r\nYou can achieve amazing results with bodyweight workouts!\r\n\r\nDownload our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app and we will show you how.\r\n\r\nWe have warm ups, stretching routines, exercises, and workouts for every fitness level, from beginners to advanced athletes.\r\n\r\nWe offer effective training and workout plans that are designed to achieve efficient results. Our training plans contain an optimal balance of high intensity, endurance, and strength building workouts; and all of our workout plans incorporate an optimal level of rest days.\r\n\r\nOur exercises are bodyweight focused, and require proper form in order to achieve optimal results. That is why we spent over a year developing high-quality exercise animations, which visually illustrate the proper form for each exercise.  \r\n\r\nThe key to exercising is to create balance by training your entire body, including chest, arms, abdominals, shoulders, back, and legs.  Creating this balance promotes stability and reduces risk of injury.\r\nFor example, one of the key components to core stability is strength in the glutes, a body part often neglected by men.  Martial Arts fighters train glutes to build stability in their hips in order to improve internal rotation.  On the other hand, weak glutes may increase the risk of developing low back or knee pain.  Our app focuses on balanced full body workouts and training plans in order to help optimize your fitness level and minimize your risk of injury.\r\n Our workouts are easy to follow, and are based on time and number of repetitions.  Since balance is the key, we offer a variety of workouts including full body workouts, upper body workouts, lower body workouts, and workouts based on individual muscle groups.\r\n\r\nMany people do not realize the benefits of stretching. Stretching promotes flexibility which helps maintain a full range of motion in the joints.  Our workouts start with a short warm up and stretching in order to help you achieve this benefit.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in burning fat and building strength is eating properly.  Our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app contains a variety of high quality nutrition plans, such as plans for vegetarians, plans for athletes with fast metabolisms, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe want you to have the best user experience possible.  Our app includes features such as:\r\n\r\n💪 Easy-to-follow workouts \r\n💪 A Calorie counter\r\n💪 Transformation images\r\n💪 Data backed up on the cloud\r\n💪 A Weight tracker\r\n💪 High-quality exercise animations\r\n💪 An Achievement system with badges\r\n💪 Reminders to always be on time with your workout\r\n💪 Filters for content\r\n💪 A Workout/Training plan tracking system\r\n💪 Availability in 18 Languages\r\n💪 and much more...\r\n\r\n\r\nTry our Summer Bodyweight Workouts & Exercises app and get results in as little as 20 days!  What are you waiting for, start your journey today!\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to us any time via email at support@spartan-apps.com if you have any questions or feedback.",

            "SO good! I got this game not knowing anything about it. And when i started! It was amazing! I got controller compatability wich is really fun and is neat. Overall good graphics and addicting. You dont need to spend money on the game unless you are willing to support the developers. And there is barely any ads! (Besides ad rewards) im new and got some new cars!",
            "Good graphic, good control, best racing game so far. -1 star is the introduce of touchdrive auto drive which takes away players excitement although you have an option to manual steer but it became unfair since others just touchdrive. That's the only down side for this version. Update- uninstalled, seems like there's bug or virus that mess up with my phone. First came out ads issue, then cause my phone can't charge. Nearly goes into store to warranty my phone..",
            "One of the best arcade racer in the market. I'm having fun with this game on smart phone even more than arcade racers on pc. Just remember it's a game that relies on sales to keep it going, so be patient and don't go on a shopping spree without caring, cuz you can get a lot without spending much. And don't spend on any cars from classes higher than the ones from your current career. If you're in chapter 1 or 2, don't throw your money on S class cars. Each thing in is own time.",
            "The game was fine for the first few days but after that the game just crashes whatever I am doing in about 1 minutes time. Gameloft please do something about it or please tell me a way to troubleshoot this. If this wasn't a problem then the game is fantastic PS: I have a new phone and it can't be the problem on my device",
            "Ever since the last update, there's an advertisement that never loads and is just stuck. I can't even hit the back button. I have to close the app and go back in. It happens on my husband's phone as well, so it's not just me. I can't claim packs and use it to skip gas refilling. I just finally started spending my money on this game, and now it's giving me problems. Fix this issue and it'll be 5 stars from me"

Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "I don't get notifications at all anymore. It's annoying since I have to go on the app very 15mins to check if i have any messages, and it also sometimes doesn't even send despite having a good connection. Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

            "Band has been fantastic! I've been using it for the last 3 years since I became cheer director for our local youth league. It keeps me organized and everything in one spot. Its so helpful with parents. You can add everyone to your band and set things how you want them. They even have a live streaming option, polls, attendance and sooo much more. I will always use band for any group stuff I may have.",
            "I love the original Band App. It works so well from. My team at work and our daughters softball team to communicate with the parents. I recently downloaded the BAND FOR KIDS for my daughter to talk to her teammates, it hasn't worked yet. I have paid 2 different times, $.50 and I still can't make it work.",
            "Great app--has essentially transformed our group's communication. Feature request: Please allow toggling the visibility of calendars within a Band. If we have multiple calendars created for different purposes, it would be nice to be able to declutter the agenda view by hiding events from irrelevant calendars. Also, please let us specify an individual calendar (when there are multiple) from a specific band when we are creating a widget. Thank you, developers!",
            "This is a excellent app. I was able to listen enjoy and be a part of a church service that was active. Thank you Pastor Rodrick Reeve of New Creation family worship center. Also the staff and congregation. Love the way it works. I will tell others how good it is. Thanks.🤩",
            "Perhaps the best application to manage a sports team activities and keep everyone coordinated and on the same page. Same is true for the recording project, as it is a platform to have all the materials shared and updated between the participants."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",

            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "I love this game and have been playing pretty much since it came out,however I have some concerns,I have gotten the short end on some plays,for example birds will sometimes go away sooner than they should and have lost out on points,jewels,etc,one of my biggest issues is items landing on pigs without popping them,this happens ALOT,and certain levels you get 3 feathers etc.and just weird numbers,rewards should be more, but do love game,look forward to improvements.",
            "Normally a great game but the levels (500 or more) are all ki generated and then its not really fun anymore. You loose in a game, try it again and it's built totally different than before. It's like you're playing the same level every 20 levels again and that really takes the fun, sadly :/",
            "Very nice game. Some individual free hats are stray&poisonous. Like Park Ranger Hat(update in sept).U willn't get hats for all birds, remaininng hats U have to buy frm hat shop at very higher cost( black gems). This hat set will not rise power of Ur sungshot by 3, only by 1 & birds power by 1. Now 'Calavara' hat started. (See hat shop). Also rewards are poisonous. After playing, U search for rewards, but in vail. U just download & play. I have 2 games in my mob, so 2 five stars. TC Suresh.",
            "Way way way too many updates. And every update is a requirement to play the game. That is a lot of bandwidth you force people to use, instead of a simple patch. So you either wait for an opportunity to use wifi, or eat the data usage. Besides that, the game is fun to play, but there are now way too many facets to it. You can opt not to play all of it, which is nice, but the interface is extremely cluttered now.",
            "This game is actually really fun and addictive. But the fact that to really progress you have to spend money is a drawback. Hats to strengthen the slingshot/birds cost black pearls which are won mostly in small increments. Gems are the same, if you want to continue in any element of the game you have to pay. Continue once 60 gems, twice 180. You get 5 lives, run out? Pay gems. Stamps? Can't even win in game have to buy. Other than that, it's fun."

            "Thank you for correcting the issue with ads being displayed after paying for premium. Question: is it possible to include in the options menu the ability to move the controller position to the player's liking? The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "I really love playing this game, the gameplay experience is awesome. Beautiful graphics and smooth. I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",
            "Best game ever, really entertaining.... Just add more items to the customize hub maybe add more tattoos and more hairstyles and an option to type your name on gloves😁and make the characters movements more realistic like dodging and the way they throw a punch.. Thank you developers for this great game🤩🤩🤩",

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "Great workouts really gets you pumped ready for the day 💪 also like the fact you can design your own workouts... Really cool.. Just a quick thought tho could you add some boxing 🥊 in your apps as a addition to the spartan workouts.... Good cardio.... Cheers💪",
            "The 1 thing I can say about these apps are, I'm actually sorry I was a little critical of them. I look in the mirror and all I see are results just from your free routines. Even if 1 can't buy upgrades,the free excersises still give people the opportunity to change their life in someway and maybe feel better about themselves and for that I commend you, & say that's better then all the money in the world. I sure like what I see from following these workouts. So much I'm thinking of upgrading. 👍",
            "This app is excellent, probably the best 7-min android app in UI/UX terms. But for two major flaws. First is most plans require gym equipment. Yes - you can just select those plans that don't, but still - there should be an option to filter out any exercise that requires equipment. Also it requires you to log in with one of the big data companies - well, no.",
            "Probably one of the best Fitness app I have ever come across...Big ups to the developers .It is very easy to follow and a real help to would be Fitness fanatics😉...the workouts can be done in any place..Temba Mseteka ,Lusaka,Zambia"

The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps.\r\nFlexibility challenge is defined as the range of motion within a joint along the various planes of motion. Within each joint, there is an optimal range of motion rom that is essential for peak performance. Stretching refers to the process of elongating the muscles to improve rom. I already introduced you to Dynamic Stretching upper body, which is ideal for stretching before exercise. Static stretching is when you stretch while staying stationary, which is the preferred type of stretching during and after exercise. There are many naysayers who believe static stretching is a waste of time and doesn’t prevent injury. I think it’s possible that a seasoned athlete with optimal rom may not benefit as much from stretching, static stretching is very, very helpful, if not essential. If you are interested in the physiology of stretching and how the range of motion increases. How to do legs up the wall? When you do Yaga poses like Legs Up the Wall consistently in the morning for a period of time, you may notice that your full body feels healthier overall and that you are better able to find a calm state of mind, it an amazing morning feeling !!. Bicycle crunch exercises for the abs: The bicycle crunch is the best ab exercises you can do to activate the rectus abdominis, your upper abdominal muscle, and it is second only to the captain's chair for activating the obliques, your side abdominal muscles. how can the floor push you up? The ground doesn't have any energy to use to push you up, so it may seem counterintuitive that the ground is the source of the force. Because you are raising your legs, you also engage the transverse abdominis, which are the deep ab muscles that are hard to target. Besides working your abs, you will also be toning your thighs as both your hamstrings and quads will be involved with bicycling. Touching toes stretches what muscle? Stretch Your Hamstrings and back. The classic, standing toe-touch exercise primarily stretches your hamstrings, the four-muscle group in the back of each thigh. This exercise also works the erector-spinae muscles in your lower back.\r\nMajor stretching benefits :\r\n• Decreased risk of low back pain\r\n• Increased movement efficiency\r\n• Decreased risk of injury\r\n• Improved balance and postural awareness            \r\n• Increased blood supply and nutrients to joint structures\r\n• Reduced muscular tension\r\n• Increased neuromuscular coordination\r\nThere are many techniques for stretching in general :\r\n- cat and cow stretching\r\n- Legs up the wall\r\n- The bicycle crunch exercises\r\n- floor push ups\r\n- foot touching exercise\r\n- downward facing dog pose\r\n- half lord fish pose\r\n✶ Minute Stretching Routine Instructions: The routine below is a basic static stretching routine designed to complete on an exercise mat at the end of your workout.

It features master trainer Roy Duquette and BJJ world champion Emily Kwok.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, Grapplearts offers an entire series of instructional apps in which Emily Kwok shares a detailed breakdown of her grappling strategies and techniques.\r\n\r\nEmily is a bona fide world champion, both with and without the gi. And obviously her high level of technical expertise has a TON to do with her tournament success.\r\n\r\nBut it would be foolish to overlook the importance physical conditioning has had in her competitive achievements. That includes conditioning to increase strength and endurance, but also conditioning is to avoid injury.\r\n\r\nIt comes down to this: If you’re injured then you can’t train.\r\n\r\nCorrect conditioning = less injuries = more training = faster skill development.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the sad fact is that many of our favorite techniques tend to overdevelop certain parts of our body. And these imbalances ultimately make us much more vulnerable to injury.\r\n\r\nFortunately increasing your functional strength with proper training makes your body more resilient to injury.

There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard 💪.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Love the actual game of chess, but am driven mad by the ads, because you can't chose to turn the sound off beforehand, so they randomly boom out loudly with irritating music showing games I would never, ever consider playing..😡 Chess is a quiet, thoughtful game, or should be! May decide this one's not for me. When I turn my sound off, it should mean I want quiet.",
            "It's classic!!! You missing out on some fun/mind challenging experience. Dope classic, chess game it's surely a must have if you enjoy challenges and it's also educational(you get to play & learn at the same time), Patience is key & Planning is a skill!!! \"THIS IS A REAL DEAL\"... Download this game so you don't miss out on some extremely fun, challenging and exciting way to spend your free time.",
            "Enjoyably challenging. I would like to know why, most of the time I have an undeniably guaranteed win, it calls it a draw? Was the simulator designed to cheat like an angry child, or is it a glitch? The only thing missing is the visual of the compu-child flipping the board over and running away crying. Please, stop this, its quite annoying and off-putting.",
            "The best game I ever played! Its a realy amazing game. Its graphics are also too good. And if you do not want to see ads, it can also be played offline! In this lockdown period, I play my turns and timepass. In every stage when I unlock, it becomes more difficult to win and sometimes I even get confused! Its so interesting and attractive. I recomend to play this game and stay HAPPY!",
            "It seems unfair many times. It shows different rules for the participants. Rules are not same for both sides. It allows himself to move anywhere any time but not to us. If computer is going to lost the game it will not accept their defeat but ask for settlement."

Maybe you could add a few mini games. Oh also sometimes when I am doing tricks on my snowboard my game glitches and I can't move the steering and so that makes me get behind. So for anybody who's reading this if you get really aggravated when games glitch out you might not want to download this game. But other than that I would totally play this.",

            "I really... Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",
            "Why is it that I always get a 2 star superstar out of a premium I dont understand this concept is this luck or It is decided before itself that a 3 or a 4 star is not available in a premium otherwise this game is good! Keep it up!"

            "I loved this game... not anymore. The update reset all my lvls so now instead of lvl 100+ I'm at lvl 1... And you are forced to watch ads after every single lvl which on average takes a few seconds. So, in seconds it goes something like this: lvl\"2 ad\"15, lvl\"3 ad\"12, lvl\"2 ad\"14. This isn't a game that I used to want to give 5 stars to. Now, it's an app you download to watch ads. Highly disappointed and will be deleting.",
            "It is a very cool game and when I play it I think it is very good but the reason for me to give it 4 stars is of the horrible ads when you finish a level you have to watch a 10 second ad and if you lose again you have to watch a 10 second ad I will give it 5 star after seeing the result thank you 🤟🤟🤟",
            "🎃👻It's an amazing game despite the adds. I really enjoy it and I have never ever had any problems with it besides the ads because to be honest I don't really ever get any ads and if I do they are like 5-30 seconds. So I recommend you get this game and it's really fun and if you don't want any ads then just turn of your WIFI, if you do that then you won't have to worry about ads coming your way. So, what I'm really trying to say if your looking for a fun game to play with different skins...👻🎃",
            "Too many ads . When I open this game a ad when I close this game again ad when I switch to next level a ad God so many ads 😡 I prefer you to not download this game just a waste time and your Mobile's memory I have given given this 1star because I can't give 0 stars if there was a option to give 0 star I will give",
            "Advertisements after EVERY LEVEL are way too much. The concept is actually pretty cool but you spend as much time watching ads as playing the game. I would even pay a few dollars for an ad-free version but they want a hundred dollars PER YEAR to eliminate these ads."

            "Disapointing is what this app is. I had it on my phone a few years ago and i decided to open my old phone and look at the app it was really fun going through all the old stuff i made. That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",
            "Worst app ever ! It doesnt even record my voice and says everytime that app needs more of your voice to give better results.",
            "This app has seriously improved in the past couple of years, I'm impressed.",
            "The clarity of the recorded voice is not clear like it used to be."

        "comments": [
            "Great game but there are SO MANY ADS! I'd gladly buy a full version to remove them but that isn't an option, meaning you get a 30-45 second ad after every few games, and anither 30-45 second ad if you want to unlock the perks for a round. That often adds up to over a minute of ads for (sometimes) only 30 seconds or a minute of gameplay.",
            "The game may be hard it is just it's fun it's just fun but still they need to work on the difficulty though like you can be a beginner and you can have the most trouble on one stage it's like hell but you'll get used to it like anybody else will get used to it I'm starting to get used to it I only got this game like yesterday so or last week I'm not sure I kind of forgot",
            "Not what I thought it was, just running through a field as long as you can. Yeah you get weapons and I even got a dog by my side on only my second run from having perks from watching the ad, but still not what I thought it was. Controls feel strange. Not buggy, but the turning/moving side to side is way too fluid. I know that's the point but that exactly why I dont like it :/",
            "Update didn't fix anything, it's WORSE. Sh_tty adware crashed the sound fx completely and won't let me ingame. Had to reinstall. I will NEVER play online again. Sounds still play after being dropped/new weapon pickup. Hardcore map still plays weapons NOT selected. Lame mission points overlap. Random weapons drop my ass. This game has the potential to be great, unfortunately it's mired in endless moronic grinding. Most aggravating is the \"instant death\" *Hates the noisy dog!!*",
            "If this game was my girlfriend, it would be a love hate relationship. Love the run and gun aspect, but some of the weapons suck. Main the beginner ones(except the shotgun) I hate getting a those weapons out of a box after having a good one. Once I've made it so far keep me going with the good guns. I guess there in lies the challenge. Ok I said enough. Love the game and keep up the good work. PS, Love you too beautiful."

            "Love it 😍 love it. I've been waiting so long to start practicing yoga but i didn't know where to start from and how to plan each session. This app takes so much of the burden off and lets you just enjoy the yoga session itself. Talks you through each exercise, has timer and even considers rest time between each two exercises which you can skip if you want. It also has a toturial video for each exercise. You can costumise each exercise and it's order and duration. Thank you👍 💯 Great job,👏🌟",
            "Awesome app! Not too many ads - only a few; and i love the fact that it has an easy, normal and difficult mode for user's level of experience with yoga😊. I'm still working with the easy mode right now, but with time, i hope to progress into the normal and subsequently, difficult mode. Thanks!",
            "I'm not completely certain that all these poses and exercises are completely legit. It seems disorganized and you need points for basic features. Overall, it has personalized workouts and gives you a good one.",
            "I just installed this app and as a beginner it's perfect. The exercises are not hard but very effective. You can feel the difference. I had shoulders and neck pain and by the time I was done with my first day exercise, I felt relieved and relaxed. Thanks so much for this app. It's amazing for now. I hope the rest of the time will be as amazing as my first day.",
            "this is a very great app by the time i couldn't go to the gymnastics so i decided to try yoga at home because of covid 19 and i weighed more and more and more so trust me this is even good for fitness and flexibility and health well i am just 16 but it still works even in the younger ages too"

I have tried to fix it by reinstalling the app, but the same issue persists. There doesn't seem to be any recent app updates either. UPDATE: After a few e-mail exchanges, we were able to resolve the issue. App is working smoothly! Tech response was prompt and helpful.",

            "I listened to about 1/2 of the free session but having used lots of self hypnosis apps for various self help and really finding them useful I found this one the least relaxing and helpful of any I have ever tried. The speech is much to fast paced and made me feel anxious as my mind was unable to do what was been asked before moving onto the next thing. I had to switch it off and certainly would not consider purchasing the paid elements based on the free session.",
            "After a stressful experience of birth with baby number one I was determined to feel relaxed and more in control of my second one. I started using the app at 8 months and it really helped in the lead up and during the birth itself. I felt as though everything I'd heard through the sessions came true and made the birth a truly enjoyable and empowering experience.",
            "Actually useless app. It's a free app to have, it however is not free to use. You get a quick audio telling you about the hypnotherapist and what she does, everything else is locked and expensive to listen to. €8 some odd to listen to a 40 min audio on hypnobirthing. No thanks",
            "None of the links on the menu open, I recieved the message 'page not found' . Is this app just the audios listed, which you need to purchase to unlock? Do you need Paula's book alongside this app to fully understand the Hypnobirthing?",
            "Great to listen to in lead up to giving birth, listen again on labour day and calmed me down. Even now still using some of the better sleep recordings post birth."

        "description": "Upper body workout for women - Beautiful breast\r\n\r\nAt-Home Chest Workout for Women If you’re like most women, you probably rarely train your chest for fear of making your breasts appear smaller. But in reality, you’re missing out! Chest exercises can actually lift your breasts and make them look bigger, giving you that shape you’ve always wanted! Who wouldn’t want that? Weight training your chest muscles will enhance the look of your breasts while also helping you avoid injury. So if you’re one of those women who choose not to train their chest, then these workout ideas will definitely change your mind. Follow this chest workout for women to add a little extra oomph to that upper body of yours! No equipment? No gym? No problem! This workout can easily be done at home. The moves are super simple and will help you get that natural lift you’ve always wanted! Chest Fly Lie on your back with feet flat on the floor. Raise your dumbbells above your chest. Keep your elbows slightly bent. Slowly lower the dumbbells out to the side until you feel a stretch in your chest. Chest Press Lie on your back with feet flat on the floor. Push the dumbbells up so that your arms are directly over your shoulders and your palms are up. Lower the dumbbells, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle with your body. Close Grip Chest Press Lie on your back with feet flat on the floor. Place the dumbbells in front of you, palms facing toward each other, weights touching together. Keep the weights touching together & raise your arms all the way up, slightly bending your elbows. Slowly lower the dumbbells into the fly position until you feel a stretch in your chest. Close Grip Chest Press Fly Lie on your back with feet flat on the floor. Place the dumbbells in front of you, palms facing toward each other, weights touching together. Keep the dumbbells touching together & raise your arms almost all of the way up slightly bending in your elbows. Lower the dumbbells back down to your starting position. Push Ups Lie with your stomach on the floor. Place your hands on the floor outside your chest and under your shoulders, toes on the floor as you would as regular push-up. Tighten your core and push up from the floor until your arms are fully extended, but not locked. Lower yourself back down slowly until you are back to the starting position with your body on the floor. Pause for a few seconds Nothing can actually increase your breast size – except for surgery of course! But a good chest workout for women can get you the shape you’ve wanted and the lift you desire. So don’t shy away from weight training your chest – it won’t make them smaller by any means. Rather, developing the chest muscles underneath your breasts will enhance the look of your breasts and make them appear bigger. It’s only when you start to lose weight and fat that you might lose some bulk from your breasts. Training your chest muscles will help to counteract that effect so you don’t lose that lift. And it’s easy to incorporate this chest workout for women into your regular routine –no equipment or gym required. Use these ideas at home at least twice a week to build up your strength and sculpt those chest muscles. The effects will give you long-lasting results that will leave you flaunting those curves with confidence. While you’re busy working your chest muscles, the last thing you want to be worrying about is whether the girls are staying put in your sports bra. That’s why investing in a good supportive sports bra, whether you’re well-endowed or not, can make a huge difference in the quality of your workout. Knowing you’re fully supported allows you to spend more time on your reps and less time fixing your bra! For the best-customized fit, try SHEFIT's Ultimate Sports Bra for big busts. You’ll get a perfect fit no matter what your size with their patented adjustability and two-way wear.",

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning.

            "i ended up uninstalling. this game wasn't bad until a recent update prevented you from playing offline. it won't load if you have wifi or data turned off. this wouldn't be as much of a problem if the amount of ads didn't outweigh the actual gameplay (turning off wifi/data was the only way around this). as far as gameplay goes it wasn't anything special, and as far as i'm concerned it's not much more than a cashgrab. but, before the aformentioned update, it was good for killing time at least.",
            "This game is fun, but if only the race again button was there every round. Its so hard having to just close the app and re-open it every time I lose the race. Its challenging, but its easy! I hope you take my advice and MAKE SURE TO CLOSE THE APP AND RE-OPEN IT EVERY TIME YOU LOSE THE RACE. And do you play with real people in this one game? I mean its geting annoying having games that seem to have real people playing, but only have an AI. Also I don't like having to watch an add everySec",
            "The game freezes a lot. I loose the won matches. It will freeze in the mid point of the match i.e. while you are running and will force you to close and reopen the app once again. Thus, loosing the whole match. One more disgusting thing is that it will also force you to close the app and reopen it once again if you loose the game more than three times. Thus, back to the same thing - \"Loosing the Whole Match\". Please Fix This Problem... It's very disgusting to loose the games again and again...😣",
            "I hate this game sometimes but actually like this game,so I have this game 4 stars(this game is a online game).I wanted to give this game 5 stars because it has wonderful graphics,so many skins,lots of backgrounds,3 players can play this game in the same time and even 4 structures (normal,body builder,thin and fat)!but,the only thing is that if I lose 3 times then I can't play the game anymore!😡but anyways I love Run race 3d a lot so I gave this game 4 stars.",
            "When you will first play this game you will like it! And then after two or three days you will see long long ads and when the cut option come you can't tap that if you try your play store will open!and sometimes it got no options for next level and it repeats one level twice! And that's the reason why i gave this 2 Stars pls improve these things and it's offline! Thanks."

            "It looks funny but all it does is continuously drop you into mini games that are so fast that literally by the time you've read and understood the instructions you've already lost. At least once it didn't even give me instructions. And you can't retry; it just instantly drops you into another game. Let me read instructions before starting and give me more than 3 or 4 seconds to play it, and then let me retry, and maybe it would be playable.",
            "Loved this & the original for manyyy years now ! It's one of those games that has a style all its own; very hard to replicate !, It's a blast to play, humorous, lifts my mood no matter the day. Excited to try Dumb Ways To Die3 ! Thank you ! Buying a few others too like the hospital & cooking games not just for myself but my 4 year old lol ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "I cant even explain how much joy this brings me! Its classical fun and hilariousness! This was my childhood and I love it. I highly recommend this to you! If you don't have it, download it. You'll thank me in the future. It brings back so many childhood memories with me and my brother! It deserves the best game of the world, in all seriousness, amazing game. Nothing id change about it. I'm so glad I found this again!",
            "I like the game alot when it's playable but had to many glitches for my taste. Got nothing but a black screen a few times and had to close out also had several times where the controls didn't respond at all.",
            "It's actually really entertaining to me and to the people I proposed this game to. Download it, you won't be disappointed. Really fun. If its lagging it ain't the games problem. Thank you for making this addicting game."

Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag. Secondly, there are so many ads that I feel as if I spend more time watching those than playing the game, EVEN WITH IT TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF LAG. This app completely isn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",
            "This game is good but the lag and ads are annoying,I certainly hate this and we spend alot watching ads then playing the game,this game have problems,glitches,Etc.I never experience a game that have 1,000 ads in a day more like everyday i'm going to uninstall it.",

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

But the quality is good and in multiplayer, although it lags, it has exciting gameplay. I was and I am still critical because you have removed DLS 19, but this sort of wins it back. Pl focus on the improvements and add DLS 19 ( if possible)",
            "Easily could've gotten 5 star with the gameplay itself. But ads every half time is terrible. I do watch ads to get extra coins so no need to put it at the half time. Also the cost for stadium is too expensive. You really expect the player to score 10 goals every game? Can't improve the squad and have to watch ads after every game just for the stadium upgrade bullcrap. That's just plain stupid.",
            "So many things to improve. 1. The analog joystick. When my players make a long shot, the ball still move towards the goalkeeper even when I move the joystick to the top corner of the goal. 2. The goalkeeper's reaction doesn't make sense. Even the GK from PES still can be defeated at short range, unlike the GK in DLS 20. 3. The goalkeeper still error. You can review that game again. I don't know how to explain it ~_~",
            "Out of all of the football games I have played, the controls and smooth gameplay that DLS offers is far better than the competition. PES and Fifa struggle to create such a unique and lag free experience, but every year DLS improves their already superior controls. DLS is in no way a pay to win game like Fifa and is a very enjoyable game. Everything about it is a 10/10 from me.",
            "I love this game and wanted to give 5* but damn! Some things really piss me off. 1. Why don't we have control over how we upgrade our players anymore? 2. Why don't we have the options to sell our players for money 🤦 Now the multiplayer experience is getting worse. It will disconnect even if there's strong network connection. And the other person wins. And your team's fitness drops.... Too bad"

        "description": "Improve Performance - Scientifically proven exercises for safely conditioning athlete’s hamstrings.\r\nPrevent Injury - Monitor eccentric strength and inter-leg imbalance to prevent injuries.\r\n\r\nHamstring Elite can monitor left and right hamstrings, building a player/athlete's profile and setting target strengths. It’s fast, accurate and simple to use. It features secure cloud storage and real time feedback. The Hamstring Elite gives you a unique insight into a player/athlete's hamstring function and allows you to monitor progression and prevent injury occurring.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nAs we know it’s better to be pro-active in preventing an injury rather than re-active which usually leaves us with some of our top players looking on from the side-lines, missing out at the vital stage of the Championship action due to an injury they sustained either before or during the season. This exercise relies, in most cases, on the aid of a second person or unsafe alternatives which results in a minimum 85% non-completion of the program or collateral injury mainly to the knee and lower back. The Hamstring Solo removes the need for a second person to assist. The Hamstring Solo utilises the person’s own body weight, no additional weights or components required. Both hamstring eccentric and concentric exercises can be performed in a safe and optimal position preventing hyper extension of the knee joint, reducing the range of motion and preventing injury to the lower back. The athlete’s feet are allowed to hang freely with no additional strain being incurred. The Hamstring Solo accommodates users of all sizes, heights, weights and levels of fitness with minimal adjustment.\r\n----------\r\nRobbie Lodge, MISCP Physiotherapist for Kilkenny Senior Hurling Team (2001 to 2010):\r\nThe Nordic hamstring exercise is one which every sports person should include in their exercise regime in order to protect against injury and improve performance to their hamstrings. The Hamstring Solo is an excellent and safe exercise aid.\r\n----------\r\nDr. Clare Lodge B.Sc. MSc (Sports Medicine) Chartered Physiotherapist says:\r\nI was delighted to come across the Hamstring Solo as for years, when teaching a patient to perform eccentric Hamstrings you would be instructing them to find a second person to assist or use a piece of furniture that doesn't move! Neither of which is ideal or does anything to motivate the patient therefore compliance is frequently compromised. With the Hamstring Solo, the patient has the independence to perform and comply with the prescribed program. The device also has the versatility to adapt to modify the level of difficulty the Nordic curl can be performed at as well as adapt for tibial leg length with its long platform and adjustable ankle fixator. It is mobile and lightweight so can be transported from clinic to gym / dressing room. As part of the hamstring strength and conditioning regime, I would recommend the Hamstring Solo.  \r\n----------\r\nDr Breandán Long, FRCSI FFSEM specialises in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Surgery and Rotator Cuff:\r\nRehabilitation of the hamstring muscles after an ACL reconstruction is slow and difficult. In fact, non-injured players in general have poor hamstring muscles compared to quadriceps. A lot of players have trouble in exercising the hamstring muscles properly. The Hamstring Solo device is an excellent solution to this problem. It allows the athlete to do Nordic hamstring curls on their own in a controlled way. The device is soundly made and is easy to use. Using it will lead to better hamstring muscle strength.\r\n----------",

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

There are very few levels, one can complete it in 3 days at max. Suggestions: try to add more levels and add it where one can continue the game. Overall",

            "Love the game it's totally relaxing and fun to play but I cannot get the first one on level 27 and it will not let me go past it. I have a medical condition that leaves me at home and if I can't get the first one then I'm going to have to uninstall it. Is there anyway I can bypass the first one because I have tried for 4 days now to get the first one on level 27 and I am unable to figure out how to do it. Please help I don't want to uninstall it"

            "It's a great app. But it has a serious problem that some of their screen types do not rotate on Arduino devices, including on Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e and S6 that I'm using, or on the A71 and S20. It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",
            "Update: Previous issues have been resolved, thanks! I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates. Thank you!",
            "Just when I was setting up the boards and telling my team to download this amazing app. Barely 30 mins in, it decides to delete my board and stop working. All my work down the drain.",
            "By far the best project/team management app I've used. The way it integrates the columns together and the ability to switch between different views are excellent features I have yet to see on any other platform.",
            "The inability to customise the date format is very frustrating and leads to confusion as the ROTW uses dd/mm/yyyy but the app is locked into American style. Please add this feature, it's available on the desktop."

Increased flexibility makes it easier to move your joints in a normal direction with less effort.\r\nThese yoga poses for flexibility will help you lengthen and stretch your muscles in a safe.\r\nLess muscle tension. Stretching your muscles can help release tension and tightness, making it easier to move.\r\nBetter posture. Tight, tense muscles can lead to muscle strain and poor posture.\r\nLess pain. When your muscles aren’t tense, there’s usually less stress and pressure on certain parts of your body and, as a result, less pain in your back, neck, and shoulders.\r\nLower risk of injuries. Greater strength and flexibility in your muscles and joints may make you less prone to injuries.\r\nLess stress. When tension is released in your muscles, it may help you feel more relaxed. In turn, that may lower your stress levels.\r\nImproved circulation. Better blood flow may help your muscles recover more quickly after a workout and also prevent stiffness. \r\n\r\nBest yoga poses for improved flexibility\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in trying a yoga class to increase your flexibility, Hatha, Vinyasa, or Yin styles are all good options.\r\n\r\nIf you’re short on time, or would prefer to practice some yoga poses at home, the following poses can be especially helpful for stretching many of your major muscles and boosting flexibility.\r\n\r\nWith each pose, go at your own pace.

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",

The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",
            "The ads freeze so the game must be closed and reopened. This happens after every turn and your version of ad-free is a $10/mo subscription? If there's a cheap, one-time, ad-free purchase....I'm not seeing it. Fix this please. I'd be more than willing to pay a very small one-time fee to just remove ads.",
            "I cannot view the ads to gain more coins, BUT am over run with ads after each move. Some dont finish, so close game. Have repeatedly complained to no effect. Will not buy coins for power ups! People complain about creeps lurking - don't answer them, then when finished game, block them. Turn volume off to block loud music or noise."

        "description": "What is Forward head ? : Forward head posture is the anterior positioning of the cervical spine. This posture is sometimes called \"Text Neck\", \"Scholar's Neck\", \"Wearsie Neck\", \"iHunch\" or \"Reading Neck.\" It is a posture problem that is caused by several factors including sleeping with the head elevated too high, extended use of computers and cellphones, lack of developed back muscle strength and lack of nutrients such as calcium. Neck pain when head forward and possible negative effects include tingling and numbness in the arms, headache or migraine, and a burning pain between the shoulder blades . Incorrect forward head posture can lead to chronic pain, numbness in the arms and hands, improper breathing and even pinched nerves. This is because for every inch your head extends forward, your neck has to support an additional 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of weight! How to tell if you have forward head posture ? Many people do not realize that they have poor neck posture, so you will want to test your posture to see if prolonged computer use, television viewing or incorrect sleeping positions have affected how you hold your head. Stretch and strengthen your muscles with specific exercises to reduce tension and other symptoms of poor neck posture. The misunderstanding of what the “head forward and up” direction means.
