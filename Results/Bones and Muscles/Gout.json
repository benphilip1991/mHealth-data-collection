        "description": "Gout Diet - Low Uric Acid Diet Plan | Gout is a painful form of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up and forms crystals in your joints. Your body makes uric acid after it breaks down a substance called purine, which is found in many foods.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that may help you manage your gout is to reduce the amount of purines you eat. Keep in mind that while what you eat can affect how much uric acid your body produces, the effects are small compared to medication.\r\n\r\nNo specific eating plan will completely prevent flare-ups, but a good gout diet will help you:\r\n\r\nReach a healthy weight\r\nSet and stick to good eating habits\r\nLimit foods with purines\r\nAdd foods that can help control uric acid levels\r\n \r\nWhile a healthy diet can help control how much uric acid is in your system, you may still need medicine to prevent future attacks. Talk with your doctor about all your treatment options.",

I love buying and selling shoes there but everytime you make it really hard and confusing, app is not fun anymore just keep it the way it was",

Proceed to make a new account and it says you're already logged in. And then it says you tried too many attempts",
            "The app is always crashing with errors that can't be resolved with common troubleshooting. It's been like this for 2 years. Just go to their website on your phone. This app is garbage.",
            "Hi your GOAT app is absolutely shocking. I am typing to buy 2 pairs of sneakers, and also make a bid on a third pair. everytime I click on the size, the next option is to then \"sign up\" or \"log out\", even though I'm already logged in. The app is AWFUL. Please sort it out ASAP. Its frustrating sitting here trying to figure out whats wrong with it. even if I go to the goat website using a browser, It doesn't let you make offers. probably easier to just use StockX",

Nowadays, it is one of the most common metabolism illnesses among adults that is associated with nutrition. Gout results from excessively high uric acid levels in the blood. There are two types of gout, primary gout, which is congenital and secondary gout, which is an acquired disease. Primary gout is the result of a metabolism problem associated with insufficient removal of waste by the kidneys.

Nutrition-related causes include total fasting and the increased consumption of meat and alcohol.\r\n\r\nBut what causes excessive uric acid in the blood? \r\nOrganic compounds called Purines are changed into uric acid by the metabolic activity of the body. Uric acid is then eliminated from the body through the kidneys. If this function is disrupted, as in the case of primary gout, the uric acid will remain in the body.

Ultimately however, permanently increased uric acid levels will result in gout. These increased levels cause the formation of uric acid crystals. These crystals tend to gather in the large toe, in bursae, tendon sheaths, and ear cartilage or in the kidneys as stones. Acute gout attacks typically involve the sudden onset of severe pain, accompanied by extreme redness and swelling in these areas. There is no reason to get to this stage if countermeasures can be taken at the right time, and symptoms can be avoided with a balanced diet.\r\n\r\nHow to diagnose gout? \r\nUric acid levels can be determined through a blood test.

This is the app you need to get it!\r\n\r\nWhat is it\r\nGout is the disease that is caused by the formation of crystals of a salt of uric acid (sodium urate) in the tissues, most often in the joints.\r\n\r\nCauses\r\nIt is due to the prolonged presence of a high level of uric acid in the blood (which we know as \"hyperuricemia\"), in the same way that common salt deposits are formed in salinas. When they grow and we can see them or touch them under the skin we know them as tophi.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\nThe treatment consists of reducing the levels of uric acid in the blood, so that the urate crystals dissolve definitively, this requires an optimum level of uric acid for a long time. The prevention and treatment of pain is good for patients, but it does not address the disorder that gout produces.\r\n\r\nGout is considered a \"curable\" disease: reaching an adequate level of uric in the blood gradually dissolves the crystals, makes the symptoms disappear and prevents irreparable damage to the joints in the long term.\r\n\r\nThese homemade recipes have been used for a long time and the results are quite interesting. Take a look and do not hesitate to try them:\r\n\r\nLemon juice\r\nThis fruit (and more precisely its juice) has different natural compounds with the ability to cure gout. Not only the lemon, but also other citrus fruits such as:\r\nThe Orange.\r\nThe grapefruit\r\nTangerine.\r\nThey can all help you reduce the uric acid in the blood and relieve swelling because they give you citric acid. If your taste is very strong, dissolve in a glass of water. Drink three times a week, fasting.\r\n\r\nApple vinager\r\nIt is one of the allies for our health due to its multiple properties. And it's more effective than just consuming the apple (although you should not stop doing it).\r\nIt has the ability to balance the pH of our body, so it is more alkaline and less acidic. Although no research has been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of vinegar, many patients with gout have proven it with excellent results. Mix it in your meals (such as salads) or dilute a tablespoon in a glass of water, drink on an empty stomach daily.\r\n\r\nSodium bicarbonate\r\nThere are many uses and applications of bicarbonate, so it is not surprising that it is one of the home remedies for gout. It allows to alkalize the blood and reduce the acidity. Dissolve a spoonful in a glass of water and drink every day. This recipe is not recommended for those with high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nPineapple\r\nPineapple or pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain, which provides a more than important property for the treatment of gout: it is anti-inflammatory. You can consume it alone or in fruit salad, smoothies and juices as many times as you wish, as it has no counter-indications.\r\n\r\nGrape\r\nThe grape offers a large amount of antioxidants, so it helps prevent gout. Eat several grapes a day and as many times as you want a week.\r\n\r\nYou have come to the right place!\r\n\r\nDownload now our app and you will have the best natural remedies to relieve the pain of gout!\r\n\r\n**** Rate our app to help us improve ****",

        "description": "Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than twelve hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.\r\nGout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due to a combination of diet and geneticfactors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly eat meat or seafood, drink beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.\r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Gout Guide, Gout Disease Management & Gout Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Gout Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly eat meat or seafood, drink beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.<br>==========================<br>APP FEATURES<br>==========================<br>This exclusive app will help to understand the Gout Guide, Gout Disease Management &amp; Gout Disease causes.<br>Here are features that make this app better than all other Gout Disease apps - <br>-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. <br>-\tEasily Change the page.<br>-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.<br>-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.<br>-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.<br><br>All these features are available for free. <br><br>==========================<br>SAY HELLO<br>==========================<br>Any medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "I love this app! Very upset that it'll go away in 2021, I've used it for SO long, and it's very useful, especially with chatting when texting on your phone isn't available. We are supposed to migrate to Google Chat, but the reviews there say that the app is too buggy, and that it barely works. Although Google will probably not see this, in the rare chance you do, please just fix the bugs and keep using Hangouts!",
            "The app is very useful for chatting with people quickly as an alternative to email. Although, there are some things it could improve on. Sometimes, after I have the app downloaded for a long time, it stops giving me notifications and I have to redownload it. Also, you can't delete your messages causally. Other than that, it is a really good app. Keep making new innovations Google!",
            "Hello..I have been using Google Hangouts ,not for long time , but I find it very reliable because first of all it is easy to use, and while emailing you can sidewise have chat with your colleagues, friends, etc. Other then this you can send files, documents, images, and videos as well. You can not do screen sharing from mobile with the clients, colleagues, friends, and family members and please solve it out .but i think video quality can be better rather than it is good enough......",
            "This app is amazing. I am even surprised that it is this good. The fact that you can video call (or just call normally) without having to set up anything is mind-blowing. I have been using this app for about 4 months now and it is the best way to talk to friends and family during quarantine. But lately, this app has not been responding and always closes itself when I open the app. It's been very frustrating and it was my only way to talk to my sister. I'm not sure what to do now.",
            "Excellent app. The interface could be cleaned up (modernized), but otherwise it does what it is suppose to do and it does it very well. Messaging integration is great with text, voice and video. I particularly love the calling functionality to actual phone lines (e.g. cell numbers and land lines), so everyone is reachable."

        "description": "If you suffer from gout one of the most important things to do is to change to a natural gout diet plan. But what does this mean, and why is it so important? Here you'll discover why, as a gout sufferer, you really do need to have a healthy gout diet plan, and, a list of gout foods to avoid as part of that diet...\r\n\r\nSo then, why do you need a natural gout diet plan? Well, your gout is caused by uric acid crystals in your joints. And these crystals form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. So remember that 'high uric acid leads to gout crystals leads to gout.'\r\n\r\nBut where does uric acid come from in the first place? It is naturally produced in your body as a result of the breakdown of compounds called purines. These form part of your metabolizing system in your body, so are important to your survival. Now, normally, your kidneys take the excess uric acid produced, process it, and excrete it out of your body.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are occasions when they cannot do this efficiently enough. This can be when your kidneys aren't functioning to their full ability, or, your body is making too much uric acid for your kidneys to cope with. The outcome is too much uric acid in your blood.\r\n\r\nAnd here's where your natural gout diet plan comes into play: Purines, as well as existing in our body's chemistry, also exist in our food at varying levels. So you can now see that the more food you eat containing high purine levels, the more chance of high uric acid, and thus gout.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to help maintain lower uric acid levels, it makes sense for a gout sufferer to change to a low purine diet. This means avoiding those foods that are high in purines. As a general guide, foods with high concentrations of purines are also high in protein.\r\n\r\nHere is a short list of gout foods to avoid as part of your natural gout diet plan:-\r\n\r\nAnchovies, sardines.\r\nFatty red meat, game.\r\nHeart, kidneys, liver, brains, sweetbreads.\r\nBroth, consomme, gravy, bouillon.\r\nHerring, mackerel.\r\nGoose, turkey.\r\nShrimps, scallops.\r\nBaker's yeast, brewer's yeast, yeast extracts.\r\nDried legumes.\r\nCauliflower, asparagus, mushrooms, spinach.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of space, the above gout foods to avoid can only be a snap-shot of all of those that you need to cut-out of your natural gout diet plan. And, of course, they don't contain the relatively low purine foods that you can eat.\r\n\r\nBut such a natural gout diet plan is important in preventing recurring gout. And this is because frequently recurring gout can leave you with permanent joint damage as well as painful kidney problems like kidney stones...",

The only reason i got was because the pictures looked fun and i thought it was a free version of goat simulator(which is fun). And why is this rated 12+. There's no violence except running into people which isn't that violent. I'd rate this at 3+. And too much ads. Do not download this. Because its the worst game in the world. Trust me. It is.",

The abilities of the goat are pretty fun and you are invincible, but the time limit just ruins it. You also can't pan the camera, which makes it difficult when you're running hills and the camera is basically looking at the ground. The dancing zombies are funny tho",

Also the controls and camera angle to this are really wonky and bad, and is really hard to move around much. But all in all, it's a good game I remember playing years ago and pretty similar to the real goat simulator gameplay.",

The game has tons of things to do & many things to explore. I played the game 5-6 days/week, for 20-30 minutes/day, and I was entertained & engaged for roughly 1.5 months. That's a great ROI on my $5 spent! After a month and a half, I had seen, explored, & completed everything; I had partaken of everything the game had to offer and consequently lost interest in the game. But it was well worth the $5. Going to a movie costs twice that, and if it's a good movie, you're entertained for only 2 hours. Goat Simulator is a better deal by far! I enjoyed the pranks & running from the police. I also loved going around & hitting random people. My only complaint is that driving the cars is awkward & not very intuitive on the Android version of the game. But it's much easier & better on the PC version of the game.",
            "I really don't know how anyone can dislike this game! It's so fun! I really like the feature they introduced where you could drive cars! Just one thing, when you switch between the main characters, it teleports you to the place you last used them... overall a great game though! 10/10!",
            "I love this game but I cant even get on it anymore! I never play the game now and I installed it in 2019. Later in 2020 I installed it again and it still has the same problem! It just has a gray back round and I can only see a glimpse of a thing that says pause download. I dont know what to do and I only rate this game 5 stars because of the memories from the game! Plz help! I dont want a waste of 5 bucks! Help!",
            "This is definitely worth the money! The car features, The exotic animals, the various options and the gameplay in general! I would recommend getting this app!",
            "I love goat simulator but only on a console. The controls for this are terrible and everything moves way to quickly or too slowly there are only 2 speeds for how fast your goat can go..light speed or turtle...nonetheless the console version is great. Ill have to get this one on my Playstation when I get wifi. This world seems really fun to play."

The abilities of the goat are pretty fun and you are invincible, but the time limit just ruins it. You also can't pan the camera, which makes it difficult when you're running hills and the camera is basically looking at the ground. The dancing zombies are funny tho",

        "description": "The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\r\n\r\nFemale goats are referred to as does or nannies intact males as bucks, billies or rams and their offspring are kids. Castrated males are wethers. Goat meat from younger animals is called kid or cabrito, and from older animals is simply known as goat or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas mutton which more often refers to adult sheep meat.\r\n\r\nMost goats naturally have two horns of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are polled meaning, genetically hornless or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth. There have been incidents of polycerate goats having as many as eight horns although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins and are used for defense dominance and territoriality.\r\n\r\nGoats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates.

        "descriptionHTML": "The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.<br><br>Female goats are referred to as does or nannies intact males as bucks, billies or rams and their offspring are kids. Castrated males are wethers. Goat meat from younger animals is called kid or cabrito, and from older animals is simply known as goat or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas mutton which more often refers to adult sheep meat.<br><br>Most goats naturally have two horns of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are polled meaning, genetically hornless or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth. There have been incidents of polycerate goats having as many as eight horns although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins and are used for defense dominance and territoriality.<br><br>Goats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an udder consisting of two teats in contrast to cattle which have four teats. An exception to this is the Boer goat which sometimes may have up to eight teats.<br><br>goat wallpapers for your phone or tablet!<br>- This feature can tap on the screen and make the image immediately.<br>- It has support for landscape mode and portrait mode switching screen.<br>- Beautiful background free and fun are waiting for you!<br>Instructions to install:<br>Home - Menu -&gt; Wallpapers.<br>Movements and flashing light keeps changing with time.<br>- You can choose from several different styles.<br>- HD Graphics and Open GL<br>- Battery usage optimization.<br>- Compatible with 99% of mobile phone accessories.<br>- Aeroplane pictures fully supports landscape and look amazing on tablet devices.<br>Please contact us if you have any problems with our application.<br>* Android is a trademark of Google.",

Presenting Deeeer Simulator: Your Average Everyday Deer Game, a game that uses Goat Simulator-style hijinks as a building block for even more ridiculous shenanigans.\r\n\r\nThere is some physics-based silliness here, but what sets the game apart is that it gives you more tools and animals to unleash your chaos. You can, for instance, make the deer bipedal, which somehow allows you to shoot guns.\r\nAbsolutely deeeer simulator funny moments destroy the town and everything in it. The animals can fight back, too. While some can be easily manipulated with food, you can also see a hostile polar bear riding a tank, as well as a giraffe riding a police car. At one point, a hippo comes out of the water, opens its mouth, and reveals as mini-gun. Also, there are penguins attached to its legs for some reason? Logic doesn‚Äôt exist here. You can set a cow on fire and receive a hamburger. That same cow can use its milk as a jet to propel itself into the air. Sure, why not.\r\n\r\nPlease note: this is a game guide, it contains only information, not a game.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER / NOTICE Legal\r\n1.

You can, for instance, make the deer bipedal, which somehow allows you to shoot guns.<br>Absolutely deeeer simulator funny moments destroy the town and everything in it. The animals can fight back, too. While some can be easily manipulated with food, you can also see a hostile polar bear riding a tank, as well as a giraffe riding a police car. At one point, a hippo comes out of the water, opens its mouth, and reveals as mini-gun. Also, there are penguins attached to its legs for some reason? Logic doesn‚Äôt exist here. You can set a cow on fire and receive a hamburger. That same cow can use its milk as a jet to propel itself into the air. Sure, why not.<br><br>Please note: this is a game guide, it contains only information, not a game.<br><br>DISCLAIMER / NOTICE Legal<br>1.

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world‚Äî if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Penguin Simulator is an artistic masterpiece. It has wonderful graphics, a beautiful OST, and controls with such perfect precision. This game has changed my life. The meaning behind this game tells a horrific tale of a penguin, their life, and how they perceive the world around them. I won't travel into any spoilers, but this game's heart wrenching story truly moved me. This is truly the best game I have ever played, and I'm not sure where I would be without it.",
            "This is truly the best beach penguin simulator on the market. Never before has such grace an realism been bestowed onto a flippered being. It truly puts happy feet to shame. I don't say this often but it is truly deserving of an Oscar for its compelling story and shear raw emotion conveyed by its stellar cast. Few animals have put such performance depths as the still horse. Which manages to say through a look more than most people in a life time. Honour this game and cherish it forever.",
            "Time waste, the character strucks and there is nothing in the game, just keep wandering hitting people and objects then it shows 1 out of 10 torch? Really it has some mission, we were never told about that.",
            "This is fun and amazing graphics and all that stuff but I would like more to do maybe mini games different breeds of penguins to unlock and stuff that would be nice maybe battles with different penguins or predators and can those giant spiders be hostile thanks please use my ideas"

            "Poor Customer Service response. Constant delivery delays. Status of orders doesn't update on the app. No service phone number just emails that don't connect to a live person. Will never use this app or service again.",
            "The buying process was great as far as the actual items go. The shipping process is slow and rarely makes the time it states in the initial email of when it will arrive. But the new processing fee doesn't cut it for me. The 9.5% sellers fee is normal, businesses have to make their money too. But the 3% processing fee? No sir. I was buying before the extra fees were added earlier this year and it was so much better. My issue is if you're selling something for 100 dollars you only make 875.",
            "This is far most the worst app I have used. When you check the prices it immediately increases. No one responds to the bids, accidentally I bought 2 shoes because this app doesn't give me order confirmation pop up, when I tried to return one of it, you lr customer care said it is not possible! And today you have cancelled my order all together!!!!!! You are being a pathetic mediator."

Unfortunately though when an ad comes up, the screen flashes violently and causes either the game to crash, or my phone to freeze and restart. This may just be my device however if it's not that could have some serious issues for those who suffer epileptic seizures. It would truly be a shame.",
            "Realy fun, but when updates happen it will delete my progress. Then I have to uninstall and then reinstall the app to get my progress back. But overall it is a great, fun, & addicting game!",
            "Was enjoying the game, and making great progress. Looked like I was going to break through the atmosphere into alien land and all of a sudden, BAM! Game would crash (screen would disappear) and never open. Tried everything to get it to work; cleared cache, force stop, reboot phone, nothing worked. Uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it. Of course, now all my progress is gone because apparently this game stores everything locally. It was fun for the few days it lasted, not going to waste my time starting over only to possibly have it happen again. Good bye...",
            "Such an addictive game, its such a good idle distraction game. I haven't played it in in about 5 years and I downloaded it this evening and I'm loving it just like last time!",

After about ten minutes of playing I got sick of the large amounts of ads which you get when you purchase goats using the free in-game currency. There's no real gameplay in this either. The goats don't do anything and you don't use them for anything other than, well, get more wacky goats.",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this....

            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. ¬£43 per year or ¬£12 per PER MONTH or ¬£4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me ¬£5 per month and Netflix ¬£8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "App itself is annoying as it is that i get sometimes almost 15 - 20 msgs whenever i open the app & hassle to individually touch & hold the msgs to delete each one, no feature to select multiple or all to delete. Today, Nov. 1, devs are being insensitive as kids experienced a rude wakeup call with a ghost girl voice as the notification sound. I'm not fond of the sound, too. Might as well be listening to someone saying \"hey, let's play spirit of the glass coz it's fun\". Deleting. 'naf is 'naf.",
            "Overall a good app for shopping items. There are so many items to choose from with competitive prices & the shipping time is good. They need to work on monitoring their sellers. Some sellers don't honor a return exchange policy despite sending the wrong items, Some sellers don't put clear item descriptions on cart, some sellers post photos of products but then just have a \"random pick\" option when you add to cart, some sellers are rude when given a poor rating. Have a QA mo itor these at least.",
            "Shopee has become my favorite online shopping app. There's alot of vouchers. There are many sellers to choose from. I guess my only concern is, sometimes the app isn't connecting to internet. At first I thought maybe it's an internet problem, but when I test the speed it seems fine25mbps. I tried lazada, and it's working just fine. My sister has that same problem.",
            "I like this app. There are plenty of choices for every item that you ought to buy. Also, to there are lots of stores to visit! Just a piece of advice for those who are new to this, check the ratings and stats of the stores you visit in this app before checking out items. It's important to know if the seller is reliable. One more thing, don't be fooled with cheap prices! Check the items first and make sure they provide complete details about the sizes or whatsoever! Nevertheless, kudosüëçüíó",
            "The app is definitely great for online shopping. It could be improved though, like having the option to choose what notifications you'd like to receive or a night mode or even allowing the split screen option. Also with the games, the Shopee Farm in particular, I have to turn off the sounds each time I shake a friends tree. An option to permanently turn off the sounds would be nice as well."

            "I find that the chat feature in the app is extremely glitchy. Often times my messages don't load and I get the \"loading wheel\" or it freezes. Also I have been using the app for a year now and quite often I will buy or message someone to buy something and I don't get a response for many months saying they never received any notifications. So I think the app defiantly needs work. Other than that I would have been a really great platform to buy and sell second hand stuff. I have had some success on",
            "When I first started using depop 2 years ago, it was fantastic. It was a great way to buy cool clothing, and it was a big source of my income. Now it's impossible to use, there is a different bug every week (rn people aren't getting msg notifications and it's affecting sales), they only push specific sellers, their customer service is non existent, and the algorithm change had me go from making 20+ sales a week to literally 1/3 of that overnight. I'm getting fed up, looking for other sale sites.",
            "I love this app but the new update is weird and I hate it so I thougj I would say something. You are no longer able to receive notifications. It has a hard time loading recently. Also the new that I dont lie is that when you are viewing and item, you are no longer able to see how much shipping costs....i would like to know the price I am paying for a certain object.",
            "Depop could be so much better. I'm giving it 2 stars because before the updates, Depop was doing well. Now, after the updates, searching for specific items is nearly impossible, I get NO notifications anymore, and refreshing my listings only decreases my engagement and visibility. The app glitches all the time. I'm going to keep trying to stay with Depop, but I'm going to stop using it if they dont fix these issues.",
            "This app has serious issues. I've been a user for a few years, and for the most part I've liked the app but there are some serious technical issues with it. depop also has some of the WORST customer service ever. When you send them a email you get either a convoluted response that isn't valid to your question or nothing at all. I dread having to deal with them but since there are so many problems I have to pretty often. Please fix your app and your customer care (if you can call it that)"

            "It's a great app to sell, I love this app because you will definitely will sell your old or new items here.! And for that I give a ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ 5 star. I do recommend this App to anyone. And I love that they have priority mail which you will receive your package no later than 3 days. But I am giving a four star overall because I think the Poshmark 20% fee is to high. I think they should change the fee for smaller sales at least $50 and under (just an idea)",
            "I love this app the sellers are great I find that the people on this app for me personally are very honest and up front and friendly. Also I feel quite safe and secure when shopping and buying. And the merchandize are in new and like new condition, The prices are, in my opinion fantastic!! ‚ù§üòäI have been shopping on poshmark for a long while now and it's one of my favorite places to shop!! Love ‚ù§Ô∏è Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it üòâ",
            "I have bought quite a few things off of here but I thought it was going to be more of a higher end marketplace app but really it is just another Kijiji where you can sell absolutely anything. The categories need to be updated so you can specifically look for tops in a specific size. I have to search a skincare brand because I can't find it in the categories half the time. And if you hit luxury you get luxury everything, again you can't specify if you want luxury skincare (my fave search)",
            "Easy to use app. Selling & shipping is very easy compared to other resell websites. As a buyer, there's some protection, you're allowed returns if the seller doesn't accurately describe an item. One downside as a seller is you have to be very active on Posh if you want to sell anything; at first start, it may take a few weeks before anything sells. Since COVID19, I've had a very hard time selling anything, not a good time to start as a seller but there's lots to find if you are a buyer.",
            "Notification settings do not work. Was hoping the last 2 updates would fix it but they did not. Settings are ignored. I turned off notifications for someone following me, next thing I know I have 25 notifications for people following me. Also the \"picked for you\" lists are nothing I would ever want. App needs help but overall, very nice."

This took me 4 hours to download litteraly 1 percent every 2 minutes, then i get the worst possible experience of my life. Also, ads every single level and usually i instantly die because theres 6 wheel spikes at the very beginning not timed right to be possible. I dont care what you do to this game, im never playing it again.",

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that ü§≠)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! üëçüèªüòçüòÑüòÅ"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "Sad to say this game has gone south fast. Ucool only cares about implementing new features to make money and shun players who have been playing since beginning. 5 years of playing and they introduce new feature called awakening that made all my past purchases irrelevant. It is basically like a reset button on your account. Only new players actually benefit here and also get better packages offered for purchase it was discovered recently. I am on a lower server and all players I know in the range and above have never seen the packages offered on the newer servers. Do not waste your time with this game better options available.",
            "Devs don't care about those who play and game constantly has issues. Pay to win only now, expect to pay tons. Longtime players got screwed as past purchases were cancelled out with new format put in. I do not understand how this is legal. Don't waste your time is my advice.",
            "I've been playing for 4 years now and its still fun to play but this awakening thing has gotten out of hand. It would cost hundreds a month to stay competitive and it's getting worse by the day. If I had to start all over it would be on a cheaper version.",
            "Stay away from this game unless you have $5000 to invest in. Completely ruining the game with all the pay-to-play options which has led to hackers on fake accounts and the influx of level 90 characters on these 200 type servers and then openly selling accounts on your Facebook page. All your company cares about is driven by money and you're just catering to the VIP 15 and higher which is then leading to an influx of cheats, hacks and fake accounts then leading to selling those accounts."

            "It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this programüëçüèªKUDOS TO YOU‚ùó",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

            "I've loved this game for years and keep coming back to it, but why are there SO MANY ADS?! There are wayyy too many of them! Shoved in my face between runs! I think watching a 30-second ad to double my coins and spin the wheel is pretty much enough, but between runs is way too much. Please reduce the ads and I'll gladly give a five star.",
            "Update 10/23/2020 - the game has been loading every time for a few days now. Perhaps I just had a system update that affected this app for a period of time. Just happy all is working now. Also, I reached out to the developer contact Google provided and the Rodeo Stampede team got back to me within 48 hours with some troubleshooting steps. My app started working again so I didn't reply, but I'm confident they have a good team who can help resolve problems. ---- Older review: I love love love this game, but it crashes every single time I try to load. Restarting does not help, and I'm afraid uninstalling will erase all my hard work building my zoo. Spent $15 in the first few days to get rid of ads, but now the game won't even load.",
            "Rodeo Stampede is a very good game, with fun gameplay and cool new characters and animals to tame. The graphics are pretty bad, but I know that's the point of the game (kinda like Minecraft). I got to Tundra 3, then the game started getting pretty boring, because I had already unlocked most of the animals and done many missions. For anyone who's looking at getting Stampede, it is a very good game and you can play it for ages without it getting boring. I highly recommend this game.",
            "While I think this game is quite fun and very good in concept, it's desperate for your money and absolutely shameless about getting as much of it out of you as possible. The microtransactions are absolutely not worth the money, especially not the subscriptions- one being four dollars a week (yes, you read that right, not per month, per WEEK), and the other being EIGHT DOLLARS A WEEK, which is utterly obscene. Do not spend your money on this game.",
            "I can't lie I hate mobile games and their ads but this game is gold it's an hidden gem I would say. I remember playing this long time before but never loved it as much as I do now . I only have one problem though the ads . It's ok to have ads as rewards as for extra live and to finish the breeding between animals faster but seriously every time I die and press restart to play again I get 30 sec unskipable ads everytime plz look in to that . Other that that 11/10 I love it :)"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.üòÄüòÄ"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Great system, really handy for the whole family!!! It would make more sense though if you had to tap and hold the items to remove them from the list and just tap once to edit... So basically the other way around. Because the way it works now it happens to us quite often that we accidentally remove items from the list. But other than that, super happy with the app :)",
            "Okay so I've used it for the first time for shopping yesterday, and yeah random things did get added to my list. It was frustrating because it was items that we go through regularly and it made us doubt if we actually needed it or not. Also I wish the inspiration page was bigger. I wish there were 100s of recipes you could search for rather than there be the same 5 recipes on a list. Over all I love the idea of this app, but it needs some work. I'll keep using it for now.",
            "Great app and would normally give it five stars but recently the Wear OS app doesn't seem to be sending notifications? It's strange as I can get notifications from Bring! to my phone when the Wear OS app isn't installed but obviously can't view my list on my watch without the app. But when I install the Wear OS Bring! app on my watch the notifications no longer come through. Any ideas? Have made sure all relevant notification permissions are set up on both the Watch and Phone apps so I don't think the issue is there.",
            "Great app. We live far from town and sometimes one of us will head out to do the shopping. Anything I miss from our shopping list can be sent automatically from my wife's list and vice versa. This is how web based apps should all work.",
            "Amazing grocery/shopping list app.. why? 1) Share lists easily for others to add to 2) Google assistant integration for hands free operation 3) WearOS support 4) stores your loyalty cards in one place 5) clean and intuitive interface 6) responsive development team 7) always improving and incorporating user feedback."

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "The game is very much pay to win at the higher levels and every update brings a new way to squeeze players for money. With that said, if you are careful and keep your level relatively low, you can have an amazing time for no money. Gameplay is fast and fun and there are more heroes than you could ever possibly master. I'm not even sure what genre this is. It has LoL elements, idle elements, management elements. I enjoy playing a little bit every day.",
            "Broken, Frustrating, Expensive, Overrated, Dilapidated. Are words that go along way to describing this faulty game. Very early game is fair, but it's all down a very sheer cliff thereafter. This is the most over controlled and forward progess limited game I've ever played. And the money that's required for progress. You could literally spend a thousand dollars and be wondering how that money bettered your game. Plagued with bugs. Customer service just adds insult to injury. Oct 2020",
            "I used to love this game until they changed the style and graphics of the game, they took out several things and changed everything. The game is still good but it didnt need to be changed style wise because it doesnt suit the game itself when lots of old players see all the changes",
            "what the heck is doing the devolepers adding these garbage \"puzzles\" to the game, its just another idle/merge heroes game stop pretending that is a puzzle game, its not a good addition, its garbage i get nervous watching these screen and waiting like an idiot to get some basic heroes, played 5 mins and i dont want more.",
            "A simple game, very playable, which would appeal to a lot of ppl, atm loads of glitches, today its completely bugged, unable to play due to screen not launching, still waiting after 5 hrs, for DEVs to tell us something or give us an update."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !üëçüèªüòÄ",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "I love Dragons, so this is very enjoyable for me. Still learning the game only level 86 i think, so still a lot to do to master the game. Update 10/16/2020 I am now over level 110 my dragons are getting stronger and accomplishing more in the gane, it just keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth 5 star rating and if it were possible 10 star. Keep up the great work everyone!!",
            "I'd rate this game 5‚≠ê, but everytime I try to watch an ad (for extra rewards), it keeps saying \" No ads available \" , then after about 3 minutes of try to get the ad to play, the game crashes, and have to wait another 2 minutes for the game to load again...If this issue gets fixed I'll change my review to 5‚≠ê, but as it currently is, the game is practically unplayable. (Suggestion: if there's no ad available, you could have it auto give the rewards. Rather than having the game constantly crash.)",
            "This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics! The game play is easy to learn and use. I like that the dragons look lifelike versus other games where the dragons look more like a cartoon. I only gave 4 stars because you can't use a dragon's special weapon until a certain criteria has been reached in the game, which I haven't been able to reach yet.",
            "I've been planning this for a couple of months now and I find it fun and easy to play even though I cannot buy anything with cash because Google locked me out of my account. It's super addictive and got some of my friends and family to start playing too. I only need to spend about 20 minutes or so 3 or 4 times a day and I in the top 40% of the server.",
            "Extremely fun BUT... one of the most expensive games if you want to try to support the devs. If things were cheaper I'd actually spend some money, but 25 + a month for auto play and no adds... no one time purchase options. 30+ for battle passes... The high prices forced a bad rating for a great game. I will probably search for another game to support. Dropped to a 1 star, legion chat always disappears leaving you with no idea about who has asked questions or anything. Pathetic devs."

Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",

Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enoughü§îüôÑü§¨üò§üßêüôÉüòíüò†üëéüëà",

Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off ü§î And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself üòä Jackie"

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

She asked and then listened to everything I had to tell her, she asked me questions that I wouldn't have thought of probably, until I hung up. She is 1 of the most attentive and caring doctor's I have had the pleasure of knowing. When I hung up I felt like I just got out of the real doctor's visit. Thank you plushCare for hiring such a professional.",

            "Superb,, wish they had convenience 30 years ago. No travel, perfectly safe re covid. Made to order. Doc was terrific, asked the right questions. Would definitely continue to use. Incredible technology.",
            "I definitely would recommend this to anybody I'm not a big fan of going to the hospital I'm not a big fan of waiting man to see a doctor especially if I don't have insurance I don't want to get paid three times four times much just for going to the hospital $100 with no insurance got to see a doctor got my prescription all with in under an hour you can't beat this",
            "This app is actually real. I made an appointment this morning and got to see a Stanford educated doctor who resolved my issue for 99 bucks. I was pretty skeptical at first but it worked for me"

However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important.

They need to fix it as it does not backup anything on your SD card and once you turn it on you can NOT turn onedrive sync back on. I am still trying to get this fixed. Ugh. It also created another onedrive account in onedrive with the same name and the same pictures. And you can't remove it. Didn't anyone test this?",
            "Hard to access self made albums. Albums made to access certain groups of pictures to ease searching are difficult to access. Often times requires scrolling through 100s of pictures to access \"correct\" picture. Then often times 2nd picture has to be searched all over again because \"Gallery\" returns to most recent pics at top of page."

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one‚ù§Ô∏è!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "It's a fun, clicker game also great to pass the time. It's not a complex super story based action rpg game. However its simple and rather fun. If you need to pass a large amount of time. I would suggest this game definitely to a friend. Who not looking for anything fo complex story or super high open world multiplayer type game.",
            "Very nice game 5 stars. Still a decent amount of people who play boss hunt. Easy to pass time and play offline if you wish. Developers listen to help make the game better for player experience. Plays smoothly. The ads to get extra items such as cash or tokens or even gems helps you progress through the game a lot faster. Well done with that keep it up",
            "It's a shame really. I love this game, but you spend more time watching adds than playing. I've left the game a few times and come back hopeful it had gotten better. Nope, worse if anything. Not sure it's even really been updated in a long time either. Plus the timing on your taps are strange at times.",
            "My Knight hasn't stopped for 4-5 Years. Bought a new phone. Just reloaded the game. Trillions in bonuses to unlock. Nice. Nice to watch. You equip him with Swords n fancy weapons. You control the buffs in the fight. Lazy way to play, but still good entertainment.",
            "Guess you could say the gameplay is so fun (& offline) it gets addicting... least it does for me.. Not a lot of hype to buy stuff either, so naturally = 5 stars!!!"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature‚Äôs balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home. You might even encounter the tiger king on your adventure (a superior evolution of the natural tiger), who has been spotted in the forest for the first time in centuries!  \r\n\r\nGROUNDBREAKING 3D GRAPHICS\r\n\r\nExperience never before seen 3D graphics quality in a wildlife simulation MMO, with dynamic lighting and time of day cycles which bring the virtual world to life! Start your day at the mountain peaks, watching the sunrise with your pack before embarking on your adventure for survival and territory dominance.\r\n\r\nBUILD & DECORATE YOUR DEN\r\n\r\nCraft a home! Dig tunnels and secret passageways to expand your virtual family. Craft the best environment for your cubs, and raise a family to tackle the strongest predators in the forest.

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers ü§ò‚úåüòé",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Easy to load. No ads. Works as advertised. Not a five -yet. If it's still going good a few months from now, I'll come back and upgrade my rating. Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

            "The cloud itself is pretty fine, but the app is weak in terms of a cloud app. It can't check file checksum to see if the file already exists so that it doesn't re-upload it. Multi selection of the items are not possible, you should select them manually by hand, which is funny! Recently I've seen some instances of users complaining that pCloud or other 3rd parties scan your files to check if there are any so called \"illegal\" files and they terminate your account. This is the opposite of privacy!",
            "No way to upload files and open new folders. Yet it reads: \"created folder\": \"uploaded files\". Network ok. Other fully functional apps. Update today 22/10/2020. Version2.11.2. But already with the previous version ie version 2.9.1 I had the same problems. But momentary, not like today. Thanks for the attention. Good job . In Trust I always leave 3 stars. GOOD DAY .Review update 22/10/2020 All solved for now. Thanks for the effort, the commitment and the seriousness. Let's go to 4‚≠ê",
            "Looked far and wide, this is the best there is. If you are like me and have bunch of media on your external hdd which makes it very inaccessible to you. Then this is for you, the media streaming facility is excellent. I've compared it's lifetime plan against Google drive, idrive, purchasing a nas. It's without a doubt the most sensible choice.",
            "Still now it's good to use. But one think I want to know,after installing day to now present time, how much MB (products) I upload on this \"pCloud\" free cloud storage,I found 1 thing is not going well, For ex:- supposed that, I upload 20 MB on this 'pCloud\" store,but the problem is I see,everytime I upload any file any size,after completing upload,if I go settings-app & notification-click on this \"pCloud\" I see as much (MB/GB) upload on \"pCloud\" storage,this app size will also expend the same.",
            "This company isn't able to repair a bug in the audio player reported 8 months ago. After I sent a reminder I got a reply saying: \"Be advised that your feedback has been provided to the Android team months ago. You don't need to worry, we are already working on a new and improved Audio player.\" - That was in July, no change since then. They claim to be \"a young forward-thinking team doing our best to make a significant impact on the rapidly growing IT market\". Not like this, guys."

Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",
            "Buggy.. obviously poorly tested. Would give it zero stars if it were possible.",
            "it does what it's suppose to do no frills no fancy stuff ,I was looking for something I could just write something on real quick notepad does that...I only gave notepad 4 stars because when I first go to notepad to use it there's ad that pops up every time ,,I just hit go back button the notepad is there for me to start writing tommy g So,Cal,",
            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

The adverts & rewards were many & selectable & I watched them but now, every couple of minutes a 5 second ad shows, then a popup ad, then another.... just spoils the game. I constantly viewed the ads to get the rewards but now it's just plain infuriatingly irritating. Still a great game but latest update bombards you with so many ads it completely spoils the gameplay and flow of the game. Sorry, I'm out.",
            "The best of its kind! Thank you for the support and fast response to your community. In the new arena mode how you can earn more points? What's the concept? First time got 22k high score and after that I can reach only 15k",
            "I actually like the game. It's a good shooter. My problem was that I bought gems didn't receive them. Contacted the developer twice and did get an acknowledgement let alone a response.. in the end had to seek a refund from Google. Thanks Google üëç but shame on the developer üëé",
            "Retro vertical space shmup. If you're a fan, you might like this one. I'd recommend it as the ads haven't been oppressive and it's pretty straightforward.",
            "Love the game. It is way better and much less glitchier sluggish like some other one which I wouldnt recommend. One setting that they also remembered with these type of games with lots of flying and enemies and exploding etc, is the the one to give you a choice if you want to play with High, medium or low graphic settings. That gives you a 1 in 3 chance to play the game and not like others force you too and then its sluggish and glitchy. Well done devs. Great game."

            "One ear is always out. I don't know if it's the app or the actual earbuds but I very rarely automatically get both working at the same time, either the right works and the left doesn't or vice versa. It's official, I hate this even more. The left ear is always out, it doesn't automatically connect to things it was previously connected to. I had a pair of Bose SoundSport which I loved, they took two input, once I'd connected a device as soon as I walked by it it would pick it up. These suck",
            "Honestly, these are the worst ear buds I have ever used. I have previously used two cheap ($20-40) wireless buds and they were better than these. Originally had problems with the buds cutting out for 1 second with loud static. Then I completely lost the left bud. No audio would come from it and when outside the case, it wasn't detected. I tried to reset the buds and unpair in hopes of fixing it, but now I cannot even connect the buds via Bluetooth to my Galaxy s10, my iPad tablet, or my PC. Bad.",
            "It is very useful. It's more useful than attempting to use the buds without the app. The app was optional, but with it, I have full functionality and constant updates which is retained within the buds. So, when I switch them to be used on my PC, the options I have selected still works on my PC!",
            "Was very excited to get these and as soon as I did, my right ear bud hasn't been working. Tried everything to fix it and it's updated to the newest firmware and still nothing. These have the potential to be great but based on the reviews by others it seems they're far from great. Very disappointed, wouldn't recommend buying these until they fix this issue.",
            "They've had an update available for a month and it just never installs (no way to manually force the update). The right bud drains twice as fast as the left. The touch controls sometimes don't function. So far a massive waste of money. Edit: I've done a factory reset, got the update to work (following the ridiculous update method that can't be explained in less than a paragraph). I still believe this is an unfinished product but I'll follow up if the other problems resolve."
