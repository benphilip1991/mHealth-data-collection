Within version 2.x this was working in Android. Also the first 3 version displayed the records. Now it is gone. This makes the app nearly completely useless. Update 24/8/19 yes the playback of a mounted SAMBA drive (NAS). It's a LE201.",

I feel so relaxed when ever i am on my way to home from office that my home and its controls are in my hands. The app is bug free till now and its running so smoothly. Loved to use it and recommended for all smart home users. Loved it. Hats off to LUPUS.",
            "This is one of the most useful apps for smarthomes users. With this app, your home is on your fingertips when you are away from your home. Lupus has given a straight forward and flexible interface which is very easy to handle. I am too much satisfied with this app. Feeling too excited as I have uninstalled lot of smart home system apps but this time i got one which i needed from a long time.",

Their response was very prompt & accurate. Changing stars for Customer Service WAS: I can't open to access any of my trackers or enter any new information. Very disappointing. All seems to be lost in cyber space. I've emailed, and now this review. I do hope I will get help or an answer.",

I have only been able to do the practice mode and in the first puzzle of normal, hard and expert there is one level in the 1st picture that has something wrong with it so you can't compete the picture and all the other levels are locked because you can't finish the pictures. Can you fix it please.",
            "I absolutely loved this app, until I opened it this morning. It completely changed! It was simple and classic, just strategy games without the fuss the other games had. Granted I had to watch horrible ads for mindless junk games, but they weren't all the time. Now I have pop ups about bonuses and levels and BAH! I do not want games that reflect the glitz and flashy of a casino floor. I want to just play a classic, using your brain, game. So disappointed.",
            "The classic number puzzle game has a great layout and is easy to play. It was also a very pleasant surprise to find over a dozen other very cool games to play along with this app!!! A very big thumbs up from me. 👍🤠👍 You guys went above and beyond with this app it deserves a big 7* stars!!!",
            "It's a really good app . Very enjoyable it contains a lot of games I love stalk stick the most. Other games r also nice, but there r a lot of ads I am tired of it and why one star is missing. Once the ads are removed u will get 5 full stars, very disappointed 😭😭.",
            "I played this games in my granddaughters' phone and it's really challenging and good as my past time. And now I'm downloading it to my phone but it can't be downloaded. It always say waiting for download... I don't know why."

            "Game is well made and would be fun if it all didn't come down to people always asking what role everyone is and killing anyone who doesn't answer. This game is not designed to be played that way and the word role and roles should be filtered in chat to avoid this kind of lazy game play. It destroys any spirt of the game that may even be remotely fun. Basically it's a case where the idiots who need to learn to play need to be forced to play the game the right way before they ruin it for good.",
            "I had really high hopes for this game but it seems to have a lot of wasted potential. First, the actual game itself is really boring as everyone automatically starts throwing out their rolls and if you dont buy talismans (which raises the probability of you having that specific role) assume that you'll likely be a werewolf. Out of all of the games I played, I can count on one hand the amount of times I wasn't werewolf.",
            "The whole idea is cool, and I'm glad someone have created an app version of this fun game. However, some things are a bit messy (like the changes on chats during the day/night phases), and I think it would be nice to be able to take notes or mark people as we think they are suspicious, or something like that, because the chat becomes confusing sometimes, due to the amount of players talking, and it is easy to miss info...",
            "1. Snippets is a problem. It's easy to tell who's lying with snippets. Devs have removed them from some versions but some players still have it and use it to their advantage. 2. The background music in my game doesn't work after a game, at all. 3. Some ads don't play and I can't double the xp. 4. This a great game and I love it but there is a lot of room for improvement. Some teammates don't know any strategy, some don't even know how to play....",
            "Very fun game 😁. Note for NEW PLAYERS: please don't play on sandbox mode before you know about roles on this game. Look it on role list and read their descriptions, befriend to other player who have high level and talk about this game. Oh you can talk to mentors to knows more!"

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

The controls are very easy, and I really enjoy playing your games. One thing I could ask is for puzzles specifically the picture puzzle, to put a hint or something because I'm trying to complete it for days, but still no progress. Other than that, fantastic gameplay, all ages, and I love it. Keep up the great work!👍😁😎",

Initially I thought it was me, so I started to pay really close attention and when some moves are played it does not give you the sum total, thereby making it almost impossible to move further ahead in the game.

I wanted to relate this to triggers causing pain and also to actions/Meds to reduce pain. This app did not seem to do that or had such a lack of intuitive design that it was all but useless.

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

So I request playstore to remove ads and without ads this game would be so exciting!😊",

            "I just downloaded this app but I already love it! I love that it doesn't count calories and focuses on the way food makes you feel instead. I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

            "I really enjoy playing this game but I wish that it went up in levels instead of just continuing 1 game and u constantly repeating it or trying to get a higher score. Plus a good idea would be to have like maybe 2 games going at once and it just keep getting harder but it is very fun cuz I have sat here and played it n I don't get bored with it yet and I've been playin about a good hour now.",
            "Great design. No freezing or app closing in the middle of a game...However, app stops giving you dollars and gives you cents instead. UNTIL...you get to the last .20 cents of the game. It then gives you nothing so you can not reach the pay out goal. If i could give zero stars, i would. What a rip off and waste of time. And to think I shared this game with friends and family as one of best payout games on the market.",
            "Love the game!❤❤ I play it for hours and don't get bored with it at all! The only time I do actually stop is when my battery is dead (I hate when that happens) and when that does happen thankfully my progress saves for the next time I want to play. It's the best game ever, the only thing that would make it better is that if it had some levels or daily challenges at least, but still the BEST GAME EVER!!! Keep up the great work!😁",
            "I wish this was more enjoyable. WHERE ARE THE SETTINGS? Can I turn off volume? Turn off vibrate, etc. Ads after EVERYTHING. Pausing, getting a combo, starting new, sometimes 2 ads after resuming from a pause. Ugh! I understand ads, but this is too much. To be honest I may be more apt to pay for Ad free if I could access settings to actually play without having to adjust the volume on my phone.",
            "The game itself is a lot of fun. The ads make it basically unplayable. The game makers need to make an income, sure. But I've played plenty of f2p stuff that pulls off ads without being so pervasive. For context, I was getting an ad every 2-3 numbers dropped."

            "Changing my review after what seems to be a total change in the ad system. It used to be where ads are optional, but now they're after every single level. Each level takes less than a minute if the setting is right, so each ad takes up ti half of your gametime. There's tons of variety, beautiful interface, well thought out puzzles, but playing without spending money is nightmare.",
            "There's nothing wrong with the puzzles or game. What's frustrating is after, literally, every completion of a puzzle you get an ad. Every. Single. One. Like I get it's free and you can pay to remove ads. If I got an ad every three or so completions that'd be fine. But after every puzzle? It's so annoying. They just use a tactic to annoy you so much you give in and buy to remove the ads.",
            "Really like the game, it's a great time killer. However, I find myself encountering an ad after I finish ANY level, which is pretty annoying, so that brought my rating down a star. Otherwise, the multiple puzzles and difficulties prevent it from getting boring too quickly. If you've been considering installing it, I'd recommend doing so! ^^",
            "I used to have this game a while back and I had a lot of fun playing it. But now there are so many ads. Usually ads don't bother me and I can easily turn off my wifi, but it's inconvenient and frankly, annoying. There is an ad after every level which is ridiculous. I'll keep the game for when I'm in places without wifi, but still.",
            "The puzzles themselves are great. I love them! BUT! There is an ad after every puzzle now whereas it wasn't like this in the past. Its really annoying that I can't do one immediately after the next, no I have to wait for the ad to finish every single time. Been using this app for years and it wasn't like this in the past. Until the ad system is changed my rating will remain low."

Had a Swann *Hikvision) ADS-446CAM that would not register with the Swann app. Programmed the camera through it's browser interface and was able to select a Hikvision model and enter the info into this application, and was able to access the camera easily. I really like this app as it can be extremely useful for me in troubleshooting and setting other cameras directly. Excellent find for me. After using for about 30 minutes I upgraded to the Pro version.",

            "Hey guys wouldn't it be great if The Cult, Werewolves and Spyfall games had a shared player library? I mean all these games are great and we play all 3 games together and what's more, they're by the same developer! A shared player library would probably make stuff easier. Or maybe, put all these games in one single app! Just suggestions, because I'm still playing these games anyway😂",
            "This game is made by Phillip. He is an excellent game developer, who developed my personal favorite mobile games like Werewolf, Werewolf Online, Spyfall and Drawfast. This one is much more different from others and the objective itself makes every player important in one part or another. This is awesome, Phillip this style of game rocks.",
            "It's a port of \"The Resistance\" with a different name. Unlike \"Werewolf\" which is an open-source game, \"The Resistance\" is under copyright and I have little doubt that the reason this game has not incorporated online multiplayer games is because the app publisher would run into copyright/licensing issues in the U.S. So I really can't give this any more stars until the publisher has that resolved."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

I've also noticed that the achievement/task/etc icons on the bottom bar disappear. I have to restart the app to open them, and claim the rewards from them. Overall, the app has room to improve. Especially with the reward features not always being accessible. The amount of ads could also be lessened...",
            "I enjoy the variety of brain games I can play using this app. It helps reduce the number of games I have downloaded. The graphics remind me of the 80's Atari games but I don't play this for the graphics. The only downside is all the ads. Way too many ads for the amount of game play.",
            "This game is challenging but yet relaxing. I have seen zero glitches and there aren't so many ads that you feel you spend more time watching ads then playing the game. I also have my MIL who has dementia playing it to try to help keep her brain sharp.",
            "It's really too good app 5 to 6 logical games we can play in a single app... All the games are very very interesting... This also increases our IQ level... There is noo disturbance at all Just a cool app i really feel glad to play it... It's AWESOME👍👏",
            "Lots of game choices. Fun and challenging. Good way to wake up my brain in the morning. Number of ads is reasonable and I've not run into any glitches so far."

            "Great game and I love, love, LOVE IT! it gets my brain working and I find it really interesting. The game loaded in the end, sorry about that! There is just one problem for me. There is an ad after EVERY puzzle. My screen goes black when the puzzles come on and when there is rewards to collect so I have to close the game and open it back up again. There is no possible way to collect the rewards. Does anyone else have the same problem?",
            "This game had potential to rapidly become my favorite except many of the puzzles don't stick with \"you can always use logic to solve them\".... Frequently, the puzzles have no logical way to proceed because there are multiple solutions... So you pick one, and even if it's obviously the opposite of what was intended, it will still work. That shouldn't be possible. There should be only one solution, and it should be one that can be found without guessing.",
            "Clue font is too heavy. Is it a 3 or a 6 or a 8? Would hate to rely on it when the grid gets bigger and the pitch gets smaller. And why do I lose coins to play a game? Eventually I will not have enough coins to play the game. Bad premise. Thank you for your response. Any response to fonts? Any response to why you use coins to play but can only get them back by paying and not playing. No reward. So no play. Bye",
            "Was enjoying playing and yes lots of ads to increase the number of gems which are needed to play but I'm OK with that as I expect it if I want it to stay free. Suddenly out of nowhere it has stopped connecting online so now I cant get any of the 8 daily rewards as it just hangs on ad loading and there is no option to increase game reward by 3 if watching an advert. Im guessing it is stuck on offline but there is no option to change this anywhere. Glitch needs fixing quick!",
            "You should make it to where you can reset the nonagram puzzle part like how you can reset the picture puzzle.. I have finshed them all and cant really play anymore because i dont have enough coins but have plenty of diamonds! So you should definitely fix that because its by far my favorite nonagram app!!"

I would like to thank the whole team for such a beautiful game. With this I also give my best wishes for you people's such a wonderful startup.",
            "Too annoying! I'm somewhat experienced at Sudoku and was using this app for the first time on an easy puzzle. I must have accidentally touched a wrong button. Up came an ad, which was okay, but when the Sudoku grid returned my plays were gone. I cannot imagine why anyone would design a game app to have to start over each time. I'm done!",
            "No option for New Game after you lose your 3 chances. You have to either see an ad for a new chance or see an ad for restarting the same match. I have no issue with seeing short ads but those are too long, and you need to add an option for new game instead of making us restart the whole app",
            "I enjoy the Sudoku app because I can erase if I put the number in the wrong spot. I like the option of easy, medium, fast and more that I have with each puzzle. There are adds but mostly when I want another chance",
            "I love the app, i have been using it to learn sudoku. The ability to put \"notes\" on squares is really nice touch! I would give this a full five stars except that if you make 3 mistakes you are kicked out & have to start all over. I do not like that bit."

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ❤",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! 😀",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "had this as a handheld (not a digital) game 70 years ago. It was made of plastic and the cheap ones were a 4x4 grid and hard to move. The more expensive ones were a 4x8 grid, moved easier and had a nice pouch to keep it in!",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",

I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

I wish the developers spent more time optimizing the game for modern screens, the hole-punch cutout on my screen makes the game render with a large black bar instead of a simple fill around the hole. Also, since I've paid for an ad-free experience, I would expect the notification in the corner to watch an ad go away, but they're still there",

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "can the developers add the option to manually add more werewolves? I bought some extra roles, but with a lotof people the amount of regular wolves still remains 2 at 10 players, which becomes a bit unbalanced. Furthermore it works fine, but this is very much an issue.",
            "I just installed this app, the reason for the 3 stars is that there is still many bugs in this game. It is also very confusing with unspecific tutorials making it harder to play the game. But i like the concept of it, i just hope it could have more wnd more features because i really do think it has a potential. Anyways please keep doing a good job on the game and maybe ill up the stars a bit. :D",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "So here's the thing: It is a super adorable game if you crave very easy puzzles. The game plays one ad every two or three levels. Sounds reasonable, but the puzzles are absolutely toothless, so you'll be getting an ad a minute on average until you get to the advanced levels. And that is 150 puzzles in to each type. It wore me down after a while. I can't recomend it as a simple game for kids either, because the microtransactions are pretty prominent with no apparent way to turn them off.",
            "A really good collection of puzzles. Love the themes (wish there were more themes though) However, too improve the app I have a couple of suggestions. 1) Make it so you could earn more coins with levels 2) Less adds would be better, you get one after every win, an it's annoying and 3) Like I said before, more themes would be great. Otherwise, great app.",
            "I'm not gonna lie, i love this app, I've had it for such a long time now and i never got bored of it. This is the perfect app for anyone who just wants to play quick little games to keep you from boredom. It has so many actually fun games in one!Yeah the ad's do get a bit annoying popping up after you finish every other level but with the fact that you are getting a bunch of games for free (plus minimal space usage on your device) i don't mind it. Besides they need more money to add more games!",
            "Completely free and, with patience, there are many fun little games to unlock. Good for just passing time. I'd love if there was a faster way to unlock later levels. Like longer ads give you x5 coins or something. Let you start out with the games you're really interested in!",
            "I love this game!! I just don't understand why you have to unlock puzzels!! I DON'T mean levels, I think it sucks that you have to unlock the different puzzles!! I give it 4 and 3/4 because you have to unlock puzzles. I would give it 5 stars if you didn't have to unlock puzzles."

        "comments": [
            "My experience with Word Connect is fairly limited. I`ve only played it for about 8 hours, much less than the 30 - 40 hours I'd normally play a game before giving a review of it. I like the bonus frequency, amounts of the bonus', and variety of characters. Games are challenging and hints are very helpful. Well, off I go to hopefully complete another level. Good Luck everyone.",
            "Too many ads and some that run too long. Been playing this game for over 4 years and it used to be my favorite game, but now it is my least liked game due to the ads and too many game competitions. It needs a feature that allows players to communicate with one another or the developer via chat or something similar for either questions, concerns, assistance, etc. I don't mind ads, but not ads that take up more time than playing the game. Wish the developer would consider these changes.",
            "Love it. Very challenging. I play everyday. Gets a little tougher the more you play. In love with this game. This game is very mentally challenging. I'm addicted. can't stop playing. Got my husband playing with me.Great way to pass time and I'm learning new words. I am truly addicted. Still playing everyday. Can't wait to beat the daily challenge. So much fun. Joined a team. Adds alot of fun.",
            "I like the game, mostly. But, I often spend twice as much time waiting for the ads to run than I actually do playing. And, a lot of the ads run consecutively. For things I have no need of (seriously, a man having to watch women's?!?) Plus, there are a lot of words that don't seem to be in the dictionary. The scoring is strange. Often it's by the word, not the complexity. So you get more points for 5 3-letter words than for 1 7-letter one. But it's fun, and can be challenging.",
            "Good most of the time but frustrating in a couple of areas. For example, it won't accept all words, only those that have been predetermined. There are glitches in the reward system ... too often you get a message saying 'Oops, there was a problem' and you don't get the opportunity to claim your point rewards. In team challenges there are usually 20 out of 50 people who contribute absolutely nothing but still get equal rewards. If you can overlook these, then it's an entertaining game."

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats £7 a month, over £80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",

The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

            "Similar feedback to most of the other users. Since the update the ads are much more frequent and really interfere with the enjoyment of playing the game. I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Fair does if it was every 5 levels or so but I actually spent more time watching ads than I have spent playing the game. That said, the games looks nice and works really well and the levels are good, easy at first but then you actually have to think about it. But not for me with adverts after literally every level, plus wherever else they pop up.. Thank you for reply.",
            "The game is good, but adds are too long. I spend 20 seconds solving a puzzle and have to wait through 2 minutes of adds. Once the adds are over I get to play again, but only for a few seconds before more adds.",
            "One puzzle that lasts 10 seconds or less. One advertisement with a 30.00 second timer that counts down. Sometimes two advertisements. The advertisements are for other games with advertismentses. 75% adds 25% ... im not entertained ... I'm gonna click a button and see more adveradvertisevertismentsestisements. Apps suck. Phones suck. The future sucks."

            "Good relaxing game but a lot of the challenges are on repeat or have multiple of the same ones. Currently on advanced level and keep seeing the same puzzles over and over again with each one i do. Wish there were larger more complicated ones with more variety. Its a bit too easy and a little boring. Still helps when im having anxiety though.",
            "This game is amazing!! But there is a flaw, the ads ughh! Its really really annoying . But this game would be a perfect game without the ads l tried to turn off my internet but the game cannot play without the internet.On the another side you should try it,or tell others about this game because it is awesome,amazing and wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!BYE💑💃😻💑💑💑",
            "It's cool and relaxing, but the ads can be annoying. Hopefully, it's just 1$. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz of the sound effect when you win a level. Early levels are a breeze but it gets very annoying. A relaxing game should have a relaxing sfx not an overused indie win sfx. Either that or complete silence. I like the sound of the blocks touching each other but the win? So unfitting. And you can't turn off that specific sound. It's all or nothing. Smh",
            "The ads aren't really too bad. Unless there's been changes since some of the old reviews, you're looking at 1 ad every 3-4 levels (which can be skipped after 5 seconds) The game itself is a nice, satisfying mental workout. A good time killer and a bit addicting. Controls are fluid and intuitive, the difficulties are categorized properly, the quest for optimal solves is great. This is a hidden gem.",
            "Good puzzle game . I play when I have a bit of mild anxiety and it helps me concentrate. There isn't many ads at all so I don't get annoyed with that . Overall it's a 10/10 peaceful game . For free I have no complaints at all . Thanks."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "Crossy Road has became one of the games I use to pass time. Just because its a good game to pass time with. I played this for at least 1-2hours straight which is actually impressive! This game has some good graphics just because the characters, maps, and coins are easy to get. Some people don't think the presents are big enough because you have to wait a long time, but I don't think its to much or to big. Thats just me though. Its easy to get characters and maps you just have to put in effort!",
            "I lovwle this fun ,classic, and time killing game. This game is awesome, I would really recommend it! Defintly downlod it! (Sorry my spelling is a little off.) This game is the best time killer ever! I love all the characters you can collect, too! Please install this awesome game because the people who made sure knew, what they were doing! This is a 5 star review, because of those reasons! 😁",
            "Pretty fun but abysmal replay value, the only variation is difficulty, and themes from unlockable characters, and the only way to get characters is to get coins. Coins are very hard to get without ads (offered after every round) for 10 coins, so unless you are immortal and have infinite skill, you are going to spend more time watching voluntary ads if you want characters. (Plus the characters are randomly picked after you buy them with coins, and after a while repeats are common. 3/5.",
            "This game is really fun and addictive, you don't have to watch to much ads, it's challenging and can entertain you for hours! The only thing I found wrong with this game is that it can get boring after a lot of play, I wish they would make it possible to compete with players around the world, I mean you can compete with players but not on the same screen, like in the current game you can't play on the same screen as each other per say....",
            "It is a good game, it's very fun, but I have this problem that I almost ALWAYS get a duplicate when I win a prize. A few days after I first got this game I got a duplicate, and this has been going on ever since. Also, whenever I get a quest, I cannot what it is unless I turn the screen. Please move it to the bottom. Other than these things, it's a great game! I am addicted to it and play it all the time!"

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

Smh! * Love the game but there's only like 18 bingos per 180 cards. Need more bingos and I'll give u 5 stars! It's no fun when u rarely win a bingo!",

The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things. I understand charging for lots of extras, but then your money doesn't even go anywhere.. these are fake items on a phone ppl are purchasing.",

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get it😊",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

            "They actually did a pretty good job of adapting it to the smaller screen on the phone. The puzzle is done in sections. You can choose the number of pieces, turn rotation on or off and change the scale. I LOVE the background music by Ruslan Gumbatov! There are daily puzzles and missions but I don't bother with those, I play it to relax, not to collect rewards.",
            "I've loved this app for a long time now and it's one of the few that I even bought! **Edit**Oct 17 (dropped to 3 stars) I'm disappointed in the new layout of the daily and My Puzzle packs. I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",
            "Your app has sucked since the beginning of september, cant play daily puzzle. Fix it. Update new fix didn't work. Still can't play daily puzzle. Game freezes when you try. You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle. And now i lost all puzzles i had bought"

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

There can also be empty cells between the 2 numbers. <br>• The goal is to cross out all the numbers and empty the board. <br>• When there are no more numbers to remove, the remaining numbers can be added to the end.<br> <br><b> We offer 3 modes: </b><br><br><b>❤️1) Classic </b><br>This is an &quot;endless&quot; mode: you have unlimited time and field to set a score record! If you run out of moves - just add extra lines to the bottom.<br><br><b>💣2) Survival </b><br>The field is limited, and numbers are falling down similar to &quot;Tetris&quot; game. Once the board is full - you lose! <br><br><b>🔥3) Dynamic </b><br>Once you reach the maximum amount of numbers - you will be able to shuffle them.

            "I subscribed to this game because it's the only way to play it as the ads are a nuisance but when I cancelled the subscription, the money was still taken the day after. The reason I cancelled was the money was debited from my bank a couple of days before it was due- this was every time, if amount is weekly, then its weekly. A week isnt four days!!! Very annoying and greedy of the developers.",
            "Paid to remove ads. Got a new phone reinstalled and the ads are back . Considering how much it costs to remove ads there should be a restore purchases option. I got my ad free back but now therev are still ads for in game purchases and Halloween special offers. Guys I paid a premium to remove ads I would like them all removed please. The game is simple and addictive and I enjoyed it enough to pay to remove ads and support the devs. It's such a shame to still be bombarded with advertising.",
            "I really enjoy this game, good stratigy game!!! My only issue is, WHY MUST YOU HAVE ADS AFTER EVERY GAME!?! It doesnt help out , it only has me thinking, even if i was interested in whatever the ad is promoting, im so annoyed that there is NO WAY Im interested in the subject of the ad!!!!",
            "Too many ads. Edit: Also, the dev is condescending. There are ways to incorporate ads into your game that don't make it FEEL like there are too many ads. A good way to do this is to make sure that the user chooses to view the ad because they'll be getting something out of it. AdVenture Communist and Random Dice are both very good at this. I have voluntarily watched two to three times as many ads for each of those games than I have seen at all for this one, and they didn't leave me frustrated and annoyed.",
            "Too many ads. I'm very confused as to how when I try doing diagonal moves, it doesn't work; but when I use a hint, that same exact move now works. Almost like it's designed to make players waste \"tools\" in order to force them to buy more. ... Interesting."

There is only one reason for my rating of 4 stars and not 5: the ranking of the high-score list is full of completely fake scores (and I mean it is not mathematically possible to reach the scores that most of the top-ranking players have supposedly reached). Is it possible to fix that?",

            "It's great at first but it start to get really irritating when you can't do anything without paying or watching ads. The ads are incredibly long. When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",
            "Some users are complaining about the bubbles, and how the useful colours don't show up until it's far too late to win. I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",
            "The app is not working properly . It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly. It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly then there come 3 options:- 1. Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

            "Great Game, Ridiculous Pricing! I downloaded Paint By Numbers recently and found that I really enjoyed it. They make painting these fun, there's a rewards system and achievements. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it... that is until I saw the pricing. $5 a WEEK!! Or the option for $70 EVERY YEAR! No thanks. Game is great, but pricing model killed it.",
            "Hi, I really really love this game the best, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because when i went today to check my library which is were I finished the pictures, the pictures won't show colored they would show blank and I tried to color them back but when I left the app and came back all my pictures that I painted are blank again! So please fix it then I will enjoy it and give a five star overall I recommend this game its so relaxing and its addictive omg I love this app.",
            "Very relaxing way to spend a few minutes. Pick your pictures right and they come out brilliantly. Only thing I had to change was the highlighter to a brighter one, couldn't see the grey one. Other than that it's great, and addictive, once you have done one and seen what it looks like you immediately want to do another. Finished ones can also be downloaded 👍",
            "Had to factory reset my phone and now all of my purchased gems are gone as well as completed pictures and purchased collections. No ok at all. Further to my review, ive contacted support numerous times to no avail. Ive done everything asked of me, provided sufficient answers to all questions and provided evidence. Ive been fobbed off and told \"we will look into it\" and \"we will fix this\" over and over but nothings been fixed. Either give me my gems back or refund my money. Con artists & thiefs!",
            "I really love this app. The pictures are super awesome! I can however only give 3 stars for now cause everytime I finish a picture it wants to play an ad(which is fine) if the ads worked. With the ads not working I can't move on to the next picture. If that was fixed I would give 5 stars no prob. But I can only do one picture and have to close the app. If you made it so I can continue even if the ads don't actually play I would also give 5 stars. Thanks for your time! Much love."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Used to be fun, a good time-killer. Now I'm revising my four-star review to a two-star review, because things have changed. I don't mind an ad before you get to play, but now there's an ad that freezes up every time, and you don't get to play a single game. It's a serious annoyance when trying to just play what was a relaxing game. I give up more often than I actually play the game. So much for my relaxing fun.",
            "Used to LOVE this game! Given more than 5 stars if I could. I played it every day. Now the ads are far more agressive and have caused the game to freeze! I know its the ads because it freezes to a black screen with only the ad header visible. YOUR GAME IS UNPLAYABLE GUYS!! Get it together please! Otherwise I have to uninstall this useless waste of storage!",
            "I'm just learning how to play this game, I'm improving a little at a time.One thing I would suggest about the game is give so many coins for each level,and allow us to be able to use the coins to reject a pair of dice that we may not need, using the coins for each time we don't need the pair of dice.Set a certain amount that the players must reach before giving coins.",
            "EDIT 9/1/2020: The game is unplayable now. The ads black the screen out, causing many restarts. Sadly, uninstalling. It used to be a great game, but now every time the small ad appears, it blacks my game out and I have to quit the game and restart it. If this gets fixed, I'll give it five stars.",
            "editing my review again... Creating game is no big deal ...maintaing the high standards is the difficult part...dicedom Was good...past tense...now the screen goes black because of an ad that asks you to install Zomato etc ...and it doesn't revert back to play mode...is this the service and the update u do to the game that it becomes worse than the fun it was previously....do something about it asap before people stop playing it altogether....explains my two star rating... shameless service.."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I get the whole idea is to encourage you to buy etc, but the app should still function. Really tempted to just give up. Shame, had been a good boredom buster up to this point.",
            "Candy Crush Soda Saga is the best and fun game i've ever played...it has so so many levels that you can play...some are hard and some are easy to play...i really never thought that i could play this game as i'm playing it now..level 920 isthe hardest level in the game but is fun to play it again and again...",
            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

I don't care if the puzzles are absurdly hard or easy but the inconsistency is what's not so good.",

There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",

I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed."

You don't give a player the exact points that the other player has like 4 or 7. Round it out nearest 5. Also when playing robot or a player the person who locks the game loses & the points goes to the opponent& that opponent goes first the next shuffle",
            "The AI like to cheat and give the player the worst hand ever. The AI had like 3 points while my team only needed 1 point to win. Ever since I had 99 points out of 100 the AI cheated and kept winning. Now I see why this game is on Google play pass because no one wants to play against cheating AI",

            "A few things can be changed. Often too many doubles are dealt - 4 or 5 in a hand ! Then, you miss the start of the match because of the and your first domino is played for you. You could also insist on players signing in as \"guests\" often leave when they see their tiles or have to pick from the bone yard straight away."

            "Used to be a brilliant game and loved playing. However within the past week app constantly crashes, especially when trying to use Boosters. Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",
            "It's a fun game but you have to admit you cheat. How do I get all but 1 pet off the board and you don't drop pets or the color blocks. If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",

I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags. If you notify the team.. u simply get A very automated! Sorry & ur told to sign in & out of Facebook. .this will solve the issues... well it dose NOT! Solve the constant issues & nor dose it help. 😡",
            "This my favorite game but I have to start over I just wish there's was a way to get back to place I was at this is so easy but I was in the hardest part it helps your mine stay focused and you don't think about nothing because you will want to come back to this game",
            "Updated and glitches all over. If you play a previous level in another section, when you finish and don't check \"Next\", it takes you back to your current level. FRUSTRATING"

There was options only to online tv payment that's why bi credited, more than 15 days over but not till one Email/Sms/Call not Came.. till I was watching , i wase also email the company but not responded... If i don't get the product i will Record a FIR in the police station in the name if Ludo King.. Why u promote like this..",
            "I've been getting kicked out of games left, right and center. When I go back it sets me up with a new game and doesn't let me in on the one that I had started playing. I end up losing coins like crazy. I was upto almost a 950k and now I'm down to almost 800k. Also, the ads that should show up in order to earn coins never show up (this is for the button on the left bottom corner). Please resolve these issues ASAP.",
            "Update: my phone isn't heating up now. Why is my phone heating up? My phone gets hot when I play and my battery drains a lot. This is not a game that needs lot of processing or graphics like a car race or a first person shooter game. Something is fishy. Are the phones resources used for something else in the background? I also noticed my battery draining when I opened the app but not started a game yet. Waiting for your reply.",
            "The dice rolled by script not randomized. You will never have 6 for three times consecutively. In reality it should be possible! The other one is, your token will never occupy the same position together in the same cell except in the safe place (starred or coloured). Based on that, I assume that you will be majority lost except you do some in-game purchasing. The more money you put in the game,the more probability that you will win the game. Deserve 1 star only!",
            "This app is fixed. If it is random, why would first you lose 5 matches and then win 5. Please don't believe them. Even if you mail them, they won't reply. Ultimately you will win 10 matches but you will lose 100 matches. They are making fool of you because money is involved here and they also know it. Don't download. Sorry but there is not a option for 0 star."

            "There are other Sudoku games that are more user friendly. Too complicated a process to select field first then enter number. Better to select number and touch the fields you want populated. Complicated switching between selected and draft selection.",

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

            "Love the game. I'm only giving it a mid rating is because of the ads. Recently there is a repetitive ad for weight loss that looks sketchy, people talk but there's no dialogue, just an annoying soundtrack. There's no product name. I think it's a phishing scam. There used to be a small icon with an ! that gave you the option to hide an ad that was either repetitive or irrelevant, but that has disappeared. Instead now you have to actually close the app and restart it to get rid of the ad.",
            "The game is top notch! A couple of major detractors though. 1. Advertising is way out of hand. Most ads now require two dismissals before going away. The advertisers are also working very hard to disguise the dismissals for the sole reason of keeping their page up as long as possible. And, sorry Mobilityware, there are many instances in which the ad cannot be dismissed after 5 seconds, such as Disney and Purina. 2. The daily goals needs to have a 'turn-off' feature. The speed penalty is too hi",
            "I truly love playing this strategic game!!! It really makes you think outside the BOX!! Not only that, it relaxes your entire mind, body, and soul!! It's a comparative game; in which, it gives you a GREAT!! Brain- Work-out, knowing that you can actually select the RIGHT- COMBINATION OF MOVES and go from one level to the next. I relax with this strategic game daily. Carolyn Reese Atlanta, Georgia OCTOBER 14, 2020",
            "Like game not the ads. I have been playing for over a year. You needs the ads for revenue, I got that. However, pictures of a women's ass in tight clothes is not what I am looking for. If I wanted that I would go to a different site. So select less explicit ads or I go elsewhere. PS children play these games. So you are contributing to the delinquency of minors.",
            "Another great app ruined by ads and greed... I'd happily pay to remove the stupid ads but they're greedy, they want a subscription! 😆 just charge a one time charge like everyone else. I'm not paying for a subscription that's just nuts.. I've been playing for years and now I'm leaving, plenty of other solitary apps. Also notice all the people complaining about the ads and the developers done NOTHING."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

I think that is a LIE! You could totally see the block, but this game just tests to see how fast you can life your finger. 👆👆 I HIGHLY recommend this game! 🎮🎮",
            "I'd like to give it 5 stars, but the ads, dear god! The sheer volume. If you die quickly you get to play straight away, but if you last a good while you have to watch a 30 sec ad everytime. It's like you're getting punished for getting better and performing well. I still play the game, but... my word, the ads.",
            "I can't stop playing but there are so much ads nearly after every level it's an ad!. I'm not going to pay for premium however it is an addicting game and is fun but the ads get pretty infuriating something 4 stars because I feel like it's kind of a hard situation if you can fix this i'd be delighted along with some other friends of mine who get annoyed by this problem too but it's ok I guess because this game has different challenges and levels and you can even compete so 4 stars it is fun",
            "The Gameplay is nice. BUT the multiplayer mode is fake (that means you play with AI) and that sucks. Also why would there be a premium when you can just turn off your wifi and play... You can play multiplayer without wifi. It's a nice game but the multiplayer sucks.",
            "Great game. Bad customer service. Ad version/non premium is so full of ads it's unplayable. I bought the premium but got demoted back to ad support version. Sent contacts, emails with purchase receipt. No response. I want to be reinstated to paid premium. Would be 5 stars if I got what I paid for."

There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.

But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",

I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",

The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",

So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",

Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "I loved this game, played through messenger. Now can't get on. I have had to download the app. I was on 3707, now I need to start over and put up with pop up adds. Messenger had videos that played. That was tolerable but this is terrible. I have requested assistance to get my old game back. But it seems nobody is interested. Game play .... Go Figure, I can't post until every star is filled.",
            "05/10/20: Enjoying this 4 Pics 1 Word game. The only 2 issues were, I couldn't locate the instructions, so when it asked if you wanted to pay to receive a hint, I thought it was with cash, and the Hints took some time to appear. The ads don't bother me too much. 24/10/20: I like the change made where a Free Letter is provided to help figure out the Word.",
            "Used to love this and decided to recently install it again. I was just disappointed with the amount of advertisement that shows up ever few levels. The worse part is that the advertisement is non skippable for 30 seconds! I don't usually mind advertisements but that's just too much. I unistalled it less than 10 minutes of starting the game.",
            "I have played this game on and off for more than 10 years now. I have played it on 5 different telephone. I really enjoy the game. I think the cost for a hint should be about 50 and then each correct answer you get should be around 15 to 20. It seems ludicrous to me to pay 60 points for a hint when you only get for each time you saw off one.",
            "Too many ADs , every other level an AD pops up. I installed after about 10 minutes of playing , after level 29 or so the ADs seemed to be getting longer! I used to love this game a few years ago, now with all the ADs and pop ups it's very annoying."

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "Great game! It's like it's actually reading your mind, sometimes. But the thing is, whenever I keep thinking about rare things, I never get to see if Akinator actually got them. I hate it because I'm not allowed to buy anything either. Stuff like Asta's sword from Black Clover or Sakura from Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun are a few examples, it always says it's rare and I wanna see if Akinator actually got them. At this point it seems like Akinator just wants money. Please remove the rare thing!",
            "I used to like this game. Then they started charging people who didn't want ads. Fine, whatever. But now, I am not allowed to watch an ad, i just don't get to see the answer without purchasing the ad-free version?! This is stupid. One star until you fix this embarrassment of a once-good app. Also, thank you so much for ruining my childhood. I really appreciate it.",
            "I used to love this app, but I have to give it a bad review. The fact that I have to pay to see a rare character, object, etc is just scummy. You can have a long game going, but the second Akinator decides to take you to that screen, and you don't want to pay, your game is just over. The game is damn near unplayable now. If you want more money, just add some more cosmetics.",
            "It really isn't what it used to be. Ads will load when you're trying to do something, but when you actually want him to guess your rare character they just won't, so that's really pouring salt into the wound of already having to watch an ad just to continue with the game.",
            "The fact that I have to pay to see a character that's rare is stupid. I know its gonna be like this forever which is why I'm not gonna play till I dont have to pay. Might As well get rid of it do I dont waste 5 minutes just to be told to pay for a guess. Horrible Horrible move.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😠"

            "Amazing! Never shopping anywhere else. they have an extensive collection for women and men alike I thought that I was going to be waiting a long time for my order but it actually shipped within a week and all of the items are quality. They're not made out of cheap material you just have to search for the ones that were made with care. Overall you can get a lot of stylish clothes with a low budget. Perfect! I've made 2 orders already.",
            "Think of this website like wish, but better. The reviews are a lifesaver. There are lots of coupons and you can check in daily or do other easy tasks (not downloading apps or doing surveys thankfully lol) to earn points for a decent amount of money off of future orders. The standard shipping takes 2 weeks or less and the processing seems to be getting a lot faster lately (mine has been shipping out the next day). Just find something cute and cheap and try it out for yourself 😁",
            "Love it so much it shows all the new fashion and amazing new looks I would have never thought of the only thing I would say is it took a long time to get to my home but I do live in Canada so mabey it was that but overall love this app use it all the time can't wait till they come out with more stuff love it so much😝!",
            "This app is great for the most part. They have really cute affordable clothing but they do need some bigger sizes. Other than that they have some toys, beauty care products, nails, etc. They also have things called romwe points, one point is one dollar but you can collect some everyday and they have little mini games where you can play to get coupons and they just give you multiple coupons in general. But some points expire after a month and you can only use a certain amount when ordering things",
            "Mostly great. They have a whole lot of really cool, useful, and cute items. You can find all kinds of things on this site. The reason it loses a star, however, is that the photos on product reviews have to be a specific size & if you don't nail it the review won't go through because of it. The issue is that it never tells you which photo is causing it to fail. Even when they all seem perfect it will still reject it & not give any further information. Makes giving the reviews a pain in the ass."

Either way, a wolves' lonely howling can send a chill down your spine.\r\n\r\nThe gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus) also known as the timber wolf, or western wolf, is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America, Eurasia, and northern, eastern and western Africa. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg (95–99 lb), and females 36–38.5 kg (79–85 lb). Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. As of 2005, 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), also known as the common wolf.",

Whats worse all the coins you collect to optimize the weapons have zero effect on the weapons. Ill tell you now, anything you do in this game wont count for anything! Levels just go higher, but not harder. Coins mean nothing, points you get for pushing people off mean nothing, achievements mean nothing.",

In some songs, it also has synchronization lyrics that match up with the song that playing. You can also search for song title that always in your mind by singing to it. Even if you forget the lyrics, it can do the seach by your humming. Unfortunately, it doesn't have many Indonesian song references.",

Tried various parts with different styles of humming/singing, but no use. I remember this being a straightforward app in the past that could even find some more exotic anime songs. Also, the UX got worse. Why did I paid money on that app, when it's showing me big nasty ads during my search? Please find your way back to your roots!",
            "Great app, I use it on a regular basis to identify songs when streaming. October 2020, I just needed customer support to make a change to my account, they were incredibly helpful, efficient and quick. I can't say enough to good about the support, thanks.",
            "Great app, able to recognize songs even from a far distance. but i wish it had some sort of a \"running in bachground\" button or sth like that so that the user was able to recognise music being played on his/her own cell phone, the sad thing is that the app isonly usefull for external music recognition and there is no way for it to work in the background when you jump from it into another app such as instagram",
            "I love Soundhound. No more pulling my car over quickly to find pen & pencil to write partial lyrics down or artist. I even called the radio stations if I didn't have a clue so they could tell me what just played. There's been upgrades to cell phones that I could now record etc. But Soundhound is safer for me driving I make sure it's on the screen on my phone as I leave. I wish it could be installed on my Amazon Tablet but they dont allow it or my HP Computer where Google Play store wont allow."

Not Cool, INTERUPTING MY GAME PLAY TO SHOW AN AD AND THEN CHANGING MY POSITION ON THAT BOARD TO MAKE ME LOSE THE BOARD WHEN I WAS 2 MOVES FROM WINNING?!?! Well, THAT gets you UNINSTALLED! If you're considering downloading this, PLEASE BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, some are just being KIND! This is the WORST I've ever seen. There are other games like it, try one of them & avoid this LOOSER! UNINSTALLING!!!! NOTHING BUT GREED!",
            "Love this game. I see people complaining about the ads, but I really haven't experienced this. I know an ad pops up each time you lose a level and have to restart, but if you're smart, you can avoid actually \"losing\" any level. I'm not going to divulge this trick since it would interfere with their ability to make money, but come on people. Even if you do have to watch an ad between attempts or levels, it's a free game with THOUSANDS of free levels. Calm down.",
            "(ed) 10/27/20... still enjoy playing will leave rating as is unless issues are not resolved. Last 2 weeks off & on unable to watch ad to cont., with level which is an uninstall issue. Lost a level & had to repeat but I think fluke. 1rst issue not fluke. Have put a little $ in for extra balls & to say thanks. Hope to continue playing// Its addicting and I enjoy it. Ads are short and are really good. Tried several games from the ads.",
            "This game would be great comic it doesn't give me a stupid commercial every single time I pause like other games have done, it gives reasonable commercials reasonable times… but it breaks down. I have tried to undo a move twice in the last couple of days, and not only does it take away the gems I ever earned, but it doesn't undo the move, moves the blocks down and completely screws up the game even more. Extremely frustrating. Other than that, though, it's a great game.",
            "The game is simple easy and better than any other. The ads aren't too Terrible, you can close them out instantly when you get an ad to go to the next level or forfeit the level, if you want the free rewards, you'll get an ad the you have to watch in full, but that's understandable. I highly recommend, and I've had this game for over a year and a half. It saves data if you create an account which has proved incredibly reliable since I've had to get multiple new phones. Great game."

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

But wait the amount of ads is beyond necessary and shows they've lost sight of their initial mission. To b forced to watch ads after every profile view, block, or whatever is pathetic. The spamming, the bots, the not sending/connecting. scruff doesn't have these problems, why does Grindr. Its disappointing",
            "I really would like to leave a positive review. Unfortunately for years the messages which are sent, stay just as sent in inboxes all over the world. Just Google it and many people experience the same. This is a basic functionality of a chat/dating app and even that is not working properly. It is okay as free version, but having paid several times now, I expect more than what I get.",
            "I get 50 new messages a day. From people who know I'm not interested. Blocking them is pointless because they make alts. When I do try to block, I have to sit through an ad every single time. Half the time the X doesn't work. I can't find what I'm looking for unless I pay. There is no way to make myself hidden from certain people. Or to automatically keep nudes at bay. So I am subject to daily sexual harassment while trying to make meaningful connections.",
            "It's ad driven yes . Chats are free that's a huge plus in today's \" pay to view \" market . Ads can be a pain , but it's a nessasary pain when you think of the alternative. Should have twice the amount of photos on your profile available. And some tweaking and expanding of the profile description. Blocking taps should be free as many are spam. All in all Grindr gets me far more dates , friends than any other . 👍",
            "This app used to be good - years ago, it's gotten worse with every update as more free features are moved to subscription only. Taps all dated '1 Jan.' Pay walls everywhere. Intrusive ads everywhere. Bots everywhere and yes, they're reported (as you'll suggest in your reply) but they just reappear. Political correctness gone crazy: removing ethnicity filters. It's called sexual preferences you snowflakes. This is why your app rating has dropped to 3.0/5.0. Subscriptions are extortionate."

            "Well, there are hundreds of advertisements which are displayed after 2 seconds! They are quite annoying. So, I didn't give 1 star. And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ❎. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",
            "Very fun, and entertaining!! :) You will be asked questions, they will seem almost impossible. But theres this Light Bulb you can click that gives you a hint. Sometimes you can answer. You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",
            "I love this game. It's interesting and good for time pass. So many people are saying in reviews that this app shows ads alot. For those people, I just want to say one thing 'Why don't you guys switch off your mobile data while playing this game?' Solution of your problem is too easy.",
            "This game is just like the rest and not that fun and you get to a question that looks like you should give you own answer, what rating would you give this game and the only one that is \"correct\" is the one that says full marks and then tries to make it seem like you wanted to pick that.... No. Just no."

App cannot launch properly so it closes. I try to launch again but theres the same scenario all time. Im on Huawei P30 Lite. Message to developers: please undo last update if you can. Now many people cant even open the app. I was on level 1410, its a pity to lose all this progress. This game is so cool and I dont wanna put it in the garbage.",
            "I loved the game until the new update, I was at level 1171. The new update made it so I can't even open the app anymore! I may never play again because I don't want to loose my levels. Also the controls sometimes glitch and if I try not to complete the line all the way around the obstacles it'll mark it as if I've touched it. The game is pretty enough for what it does.",
            "Brilliant gameplay, my go to game. I was on level 482 before I updated. Now, the app won't even bloody open. I have been trying to open it for the last week or so but still no hope. I've tried every solution under the sun, except for deleting it because I don't want to lose my place in the game. Nevermind I guess🤷🏻‍♀️",
            "Nearly ADnoyance free casual game. Basically you try to paste the level area with your colour. Each level consists of two areas, sometimes without moving enemy elements.

            "This game was my favorite game but after its latest update(the change of the icon of the game) the game had stopped working and is just taking my phone's storage and whenever I try to open this app it does not open and it shows that color fill 3D is not responding or it shows that color fill 3D keeps stopping and we always get 3 options 1. Write a feedback 2. App info 3. Close app and even after sending many feedbacks in which the same problem that is occurring is written but still it's the same"

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "This game is nice but when I was playing the second level it was very difficult. Usually in many games the higher levels will be difficult. And also we should use the hint option only for two times .",
            "Uninstalled after 1 ad. Happened right after 1st level. Implement a way that would make consumers want to watch an ad. Make it worth watching. Instead of throwing them at the community for ad revenue",
            "I got 2 ads before I even started the game when I was trying to figure out what each of the icons on the bottom of the screen meant, so when I clicked them and got redirected but both times when I clicked back into the game I got ads, not only that but I deleted after about 2 minutes because I realized that this game would get far too repetitive for me to put up with the ads, I you want a game to test your knowledge, I'd play sudoku or solitaire instead.",
            "Ok so this game is 100% on my recommendation list the levels aren't to hard and their quite fun actually! The reason I did 4 stars is the controls after a while the controls get very tedious as the controls don't move the right way to how you need them too, I think it's a bug of some sorts ,if you can fix that I'll up my review to 5 stars thank you for this game :3"

Some of the colours are too similar to distinguish (ie theres two shades of grey almost the same), and the backgrounds options are 1 dark blue or various browns?

A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play!

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

I wanted to wait until I got along further in the game to comment my honest reply. I'm currently on level 331. At first yes it's VERY EASY, but as it goes on the levels do get harder, but the hints are very helpful!!",

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

So she just clicks around until it lets her move on. Since we do this through school, I asked her teacher to reset her level, but she doesn't know how. So she emailed customer support and recieved NO RESPONSE. pretty crazy since you know the school is paying for it. ABC Mouse is way better and way more fun.",

            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all beàt me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",

            "I've been using busuu for learning languages for 2 years. Overall I like it, all the lessons it's easy to understand for us that know nothing in every language we want to learn. I paid premium cause I always overseas and I need to use the app offline. But when it comes in offline mode, sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't work. I download all the chapter, but it always says I have a connection problem. But offline means I dont need any connection to use the app, right?",
            "There seems to be a little problem on correction. I've been experiencing the problem for at least a month, I guess. Whenever I correct someone, the corrected world that has been highlited in green, disappears after I sent the correction. The same goes with the stars. I grade stars but it disappears after I sent the correction. No highlights on stars or corrected words.",
            "I really like this app, and I have a Premium Plus subscription. One of the things that makes it more appealing is its vocabulary feature. Duolingo, for example, doesn't allow you to review vocabulary, and Busuu does. However, the vocabulary feature is very lacking. I wish this app took an approach like SpanishDict, where it lets you know if you only miss a single letter instead of counting the whole thing wrong. Also, it counts it wrong if you add the article (los) in front of the vocab word.",
            "I cancelled the subscription in Google play, however it was apparently set to renew on the online version. I received no warning that busuu were going to charge £120 for 2yrs subscription. I email their service team immediately and explain that it was not wanted and to please refund. They refused, quoting policy. This is blatantly opportunistic and a terrible way to treat a customer who used the service for the previous 2 years. The app is also inferior to duolingo, this may shape their attitude",
            "1. When someone corrects your stuff, the notification pops up directly over the \"next page\" button while studying. If you tap on it by accident, you get to the correction and have to start the whole lesson again from the very beginning. 2. An option to sort vocab from newest to oldest would be very helpful. 3. You can't set vocab on \"learned/green/ignore\" by yourself. 4. The new system with stars and competition (if you want) is amazing! I love it."

            "Good game if a bit boring. My main problem is that the yellow balls with stripes look like money from far away. Quite a simple problem and can be fixed easily. Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",
            "LOVE THIIIIIIISSSSSS but there is lots of lagging I have a good quality phone because its lagging it's weird but it's the game. Worth playing very fun and can get a little boring.",
            "Difficult, but extremely fun at the same time. If people are complaining about ads, then turn your WiFi/mobile data off. 5/5"

Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

            "Not a huge fan of the battle mechanics.. the story is great, each character seems detailed.. my only quam is that I've done easily over 100 pulls for new characters and have pulled the same 10 blue tier the whole time. Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",
            "If there is a single game that I have enjoyed thoroughly through the years and have never been frustrated with, its sdorica! From the music to the story (which is a 12/10!!!) You cannot go wrong, give it a try!",
            "Im giving this one star because while I adore this game I can only play on wifi. I have a good 4g connection on my galaxy s9 plus and it keeps asking for a stable connection. Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "I really like the idea, the art is very nice. Everything feels natural with the controls. The one thing I DONT LIKE is that it feels like a tutorial for 29 levels and then level 30 took me by surprise. It was a fun challenge. But a steep jump in difficulty progression. Once again, a great game which deserves 5 stars, but tweaks could be made to better user experience!",
            "Would be a good game if they didn't just repeat the same puzzles over and over again, just flipping and reversing previous levels. It's dumb. Also you can't go back to previous levels you can only play the one you're on and the difficult ones come maybe once in 50 levels. Boring. And since it's a VOODOO game, you know you have to turn off your data and wifi otherwise you'll be hit with a ridiculous amount of ads... At least one after each 10 second level...",
            "Good concept, decent design, crappy execution. I think it's relaxing, and it'd be fun if the ads weren't so intrusive, it didn't constantly repeat levels, and if there was actually thought put into the puzzles. Half of the time you can't actually make any choices. You just move the ball on a track. The other half it's very random feeling. There's no ramp up in challenge. Some of the first levels are repeated much later in the game.",
            "You must work on levels. how come level 139 is as easy as level 1.. It seems its just showing up any random level and back button does not work when you are playing a level... you cannot go back to level listing. I could play this game with absolutely no mind involved. Its like drawing doodles on a blank paper. and after some time. people will just delete it out of boredome. Seems like work of someone new with game dev. well if that is the case. Keep it up. Consider players' perspective.",
            "The first time I played this game it was pretty cool good but as I played it more I realized that the levels became easier.... I hate the game now. Even though level 20 and 15 look \"hard\" their really easy so umm.... Why do people even give this five four three stars? ;-; I'm honestly disappointed well done to the people who tried and are enjoying the game. Oh and to many ads!.. the same fricking and keeps playing again (x2) So like um the ads are way to much"

            "Have used this app successfully for several years on multiple devices. However, it has now stopped working completely following an upgrade to Android 10 - as other reviewers have reported. App appears to install correctly and allows you to lock individual apps so they require PIN/ pattern to run them. Once you've configured the app, it simply doesn't work - you can open any app on the phone without your PIN. I've tried a uninstall/ reinstall but that didn't work either. Uninstalled permanently and replaced with rival app.",
            "Kudos to AppLock Developers, I have been using the app for over 5years and currently on my Android 10 and it's doing just fine. People that complain it doesn't work needs to confirm if in their memory (RAM) cleaning, the app is white listed and also allow the app complete access to the phone e.g access to modify files, access to camera, access to notifications etc. The only problem I encountered is the phone cleaner within the app it's cleans important files, Thanks",
            "Keeps saying my SD storage is full but all the files I try and add into the vault are in the SD card that still has 98GB worth of free data. Looking at it again it drags it off my SD card and into my internal storage clogging up my phone. Uninstalling the app keeps all those files locked up forcing me to reinstall the app after I delete one of my other apps. Too much of a pain in the ass to work with to be installed.",
            "Apparently no longer get any support. and I have been a VIP also known as premium subscriber for several years. Have been trying for weeks now to get support at the listed email site. The app will not recognize that I am a paid member and all my configurations disappeared when the app updated itself. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to see if I could get my configured settings back. All I get by email is just an automated response to check the FAQ.",
            "I've been using this app for more than 5 years now and it's exceptional. But I just downloaded it now on my newly bought phone (Redmi Note 9S Global) and it's no longer working in terms of locking system apps (Gallery, Photos, File Manager, Messenger, etc). I locked those apps to require a password everytime it will be opened, but sad to say it's opening right away even if I set it to be locked. It sucks to say that this app now sucks big time. Please fix it ASAP."

I suggest you to download this game only other than Temple Run 2 because it's has characters, power ups and more. It's less MB also. But I have given 4 stars it is not running smoothly. The characters are very expensive. Please less the rate. And the most annoying thing is the BIGGEST DEVIL- THE ADS !!!! 😈😈😈. They come after every run and I didn't like it at all. Please remove the Ads ! Please !!!",
            "I'm gave 4stars to this game. This game is very interesting and entertainment. When I'm was bored I was started to playing this game. The man is running we have to face the rivers, rocks and gaps. And we also to collect the coins on the way of running. We have also change the characters also but we have more money. I collect 5000coins for the 1st run I bought a one new character. But other characters we can't able to bought for coins. At last this is a very interesting game for kids below 13r14.",
            "It is a very nice game. The characters are wonderful. The scenary of the environment around is awesome. But one thing's very annoying,,,the ads!!! I want the ads removed. It's really very annoying. But if I forget about the ads,then I will say that it's a wonderful and mind-blowing game",
            "I clicked on the game, it takes ages to load and then the game just completely froze. And then it went off the game back onto my home screen. All I wanted to do was play the game but it kept on doing the same thing (freezing). I am very dissapointed as I was very excited to play this game as i haven't played it in a long long time.",
            "It's an awesome game !!! I Love this game very much. The character are wonderful. But there is one reason that i didn't give it 5 star. It's because of howmany ads. Overall, a great game."

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "I like this game a lot it goes pretty smooth for my phone and it brings back memories because I used to have it and got it again now!but there is defenently one thing I would change. i spent a lot of time to try to get a legendary and I did but it got me the same one a few times so please make it so that you cant get the same vehicle twice it kinda wasted my time.",
            "The gameplay is good, but for the love of dogs, RANDOM POP UP ADS, WITH SOUND, AFTER EVERY MATCH? SERIOUSLY? Come on BearBit Studios, you're better than this. I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

The difficulty gets harder and harder, and it seems to exactly predict when you start getting bored and then you level up. There are a lot of ads but if you turn WiFi off they won't appear. I would highly recommend this as a time killer or brain tester. 5 stars",
            "What an amazing game! I had installed this game before 3 months😋I always get bored by playing puzzle games but this game is fun and there are many sub games like two dots,rolling ball,maze,plumber,escape,tangagram,and so on.....This is the first time I have enjoyed the puzzle game.Comparing to other puzzle games I think this is the best game i have ever experienced.I have decided that I dont delete this game because its not a boring game.Please download this game and see ur boredom will fo of😎",
            "I've seen a few comments about smaller this on the game or how it want working for them, but honestly, I have no issue with the game, run it fine, and find the graphics amazing! Thank you for also being well up to date with responding fo people although if can be hard to respond to them all. Would not recommend enough.",

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",

I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option.

            "The design is simple and cute, and gameplay itself works well. Description says \"without ads\". The ads it has are not too frequent obnoxious, but they are there. The color customization is nice, but some parts of the menu are confusing and it took me a while to notice the Information panel. Trying to upload a photo gives me an error every time.",
            "The last row and the order of the numbers are where the fight starts. There is away to set the play in order for the order too work out right but I still have not got it. It is a simple game. But the 7x7 is the real challenge. 🤬",
            "By far the best 15-puzzle app out there. Free and with minimal ads makes it even better. I was wondering if the timer could be XX.xx rather than just XX (seconds). Thank you!",
            "Just Perfect! I already liked how the controls work and being able to see your time and moves, and that it counts as multiple moves if you slide multiple pieces at once. And then... I realized that I could customize the colors and even choose an img as source... being able to use Ainsley Harriott's face on it is 10 out of 10 lol",
            "This is almost everything I want in a slide puzzle game There are 3x3 through 7x7 puzzles, and with Google play games you can compete with other people. There is also move count mode which is amazing., And Blind mode too. The tiles have an animation when you click. If it were instant you could move a little faster, but it is great quality and reacts well to moving a bunch of tiles really fast. Few Ads You can change colors of the numbers and tiles which I love."

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Ads pop often, but not more than few seconds to X. Great gameplay! I don't mind ads, I will support. It's when it's like every minute that is a bit much so 4/5★",
            "The app game is far too easy compared to the web version. No big numbers come through and there's less rows. Its soooo easy its boring I've stopped my game. I can't play online version cause one of the adds keep freezing at 2.48",
            "As a business owner you need to strike a balance between making money and keeping your customers. When your app is overwhelmed with ads - and long ads at that - you lose customers. I've been playing this game for a long time however with the recent ad breaks for no reason at all, I'm out. There are too many other games to try."

            "This is a cute game, but there are WAAAAAY too many ads! I don't need them forced on me in such an aggressive manner. Everything you do is another ad. Update: I bought the full version advertised, \"ad free\" of the game and you STILL are forced to watch ads. I immediately went for a refund and there wasn't an option. Do NOT let these people steal your money! THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM!",
            "Love the game. Although it has way to many ads, after every round there is a ad. I hate this so I'm giving it 4 stars. Please fix this, and I might come back and change my answer. Besides all the ads this Is a great game so I recommend anyone that likes tricky games and dosent mind lots of ads this game Is for you. But again please fix the ad problem it is getting on my nerves! But I will not delete this app. Thank you",
            "The ads are manageable if you keep your wifi off, and the graphics are cute. The biggest problem is that it just becomes tedious after a while. 2 choices for every level, sometimes logical and sometimes meant to be funny ... but it jusst gets boring really fast.",
            "I uninstalled immediately. After literally 3 seconds of playing a portion of the game, there are two ads: one of which you need to wait 5 seconds to skip, and the other is a full 30 seconds, all after 3 seconds of game play!! Absolutely obnoxious. And then it repeats.",
            "Clicked on only 2 things in the game and was hit with 5 full length adverts. This is just advert city. You have no time to enjoy the game, its just random tap and boom you're bombarded with adverts. I get that adverts fund development but there needs to be a trade off. In this case there is almost zero game and just one advertisement after the other. The hubris of calling this a game and then asking you to rate it after only 2 interactions with the game is staggering."

I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",

All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue.

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

            "Too many ads. Every 2 moves you get another 30 second ad that you can't exit out of. Used to not have an excessive amount of ads but the latest update has added way too many. You actually forget what you were doing bc they go to an ad in the middle of a move. Used to be my favorite game app but now I have to delete it. I understand the importance of ads for revenue but I'm not interested in watching 1 30 second ad for 30 seconds of play time. Deleting this app now.",
            "Love this app. It's more than just 2048. I love playing Sudoku on here. It's full of game modes. Not all of them are fun to me. But the ones that I like are great. And the ones that I don't like, are the ones I haven't tried. I don't usually write reviews, because I think my time can be better spent, but damn, I genuinely love this app.",
            "I gave this game 3 stars and i was being generous because im about to uninstall because when im playing the dam game ad's start popping up right in the middle of the game!! And its aggravating as hell!! It would be a cool game if those stupid dumb ass ads would stop popping up in the middle of the game while im playing its stupid why couldn't it wait until the game is over then show those stupid ads they play the same silly ads over and over smmfh get ya mind right Developers STOP WITH THE ADS!!",
            "Accidentally hit the no ads button and it immediately said purchased with no way of undoing. It didn't even tell me how much I was charged. Please let me undo this. Have enjoyed the app until then",

All of a sudden today crash!! uninstalled and reinstalled no help 9/14 uninstalled and reinstalled but still wont stay open Sept. 17 tried several more times to install and just won't stay open"

            "Block craft is an amazing game! I only see a few problems. When I watch a add for more blocks it does not give me my prize.Please try to fix this! Also I would like to add a friends list so you could vistit your friends village. Besides that it is a really exfun game! Also can you buy things with your coins? That would be very helpful! I dont have any gems. One more thing. It gets pretty upseting when you run out of blocks. Its best if you don't level up. You really should get this game!",
            "Well Personly this game is AMAZING and you can build WHATEVER YOU WANT! So i recomend to play this game and Going to the build button on the right and clicking it, it gives you many different options when you level up you'll see more buildings and so you can build yourself your own personal house and stuff so i hope you have fun playing this game!",
            "Block Craft 3D is a nice game. You could get ideas from other's villages. You could buy pets, doors 🚪, and some others. But please 1 tiny thing. Can you fix the credit card issue. Cause I'm 10 and I don't have a credit card number. Way far from that, I love the game and Thank you!",
            "The game keeps closing for no reason and it's annoying when it gets stuck and when you are walking it makes you go through the building or through the wall. The cool part is that you don't have to build stairs. if you build a tall building and a single file building on that wall if you take out two blocks and stand under it and place on block under your avertar you will go right to the top of your building almost like an elevator",
            "Bad game You can't fly without paying, There is no survival mode, you can RUN OUT of blocks in creative mode, you have to wait 2 and a half hours to get them back. Speaking of blocks, you only get like 40 blocks for free. You can unlock a maximum of 20 blocks at a time for an unreasonable price. Bad game. Did I mention that you can't sneak?"

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",

The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",

But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",

Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3.

            "Sir please check these four big issues. A) During online game Sometimes fence and dice are cancelled as soon as it is used. B) During offline game with friends If 4 players are playing and one of them is about to win, in this condition if he put fence and wins in same chance then that fence is put permanently, it doesn't remove even after 1 round moves of all players. C) Sometimes guest id is changed automatically and all coins get vanished. D)Issues mentioned by Khushi.",
            "Sir, please bring a new feature that has a lot of modes, Team Vs team, Sir, there are two or three shortcomings in it, due to which we will not give it a 5 rating because it has this deficiency. One, we cannot change its theme. We don't like this garden theme, The third drawback is that if a friend of ours is online. The remaining two friends are offline, but we have to play four-player match. So where to bring two more people. Can it not be possible? Two strangers descended into the automa",
            "Super app but we can't play online with 3 friends and maximum player is 4 only and some times the app is not working properly some icons are not appear in app and no graphics when playing and we can't play team vs team",
            "Don't install this stupid useless app...this have lot of bugs and errors...the developer recommended for updation and updation can not remove any bugs .....morethan these all my coins are disappearing and sometimes dies dosent work properly and the game makes my opponent to win....very bad experience...worst worst worst app that i have ever seen 😡😡😡😡😡",
            "Initially I enjoyed, but later I noticed the dice outcomes are not randomised & promoting only the new players. I would have played around 1000 games. The algorithm is designed for the experienced players that whatever we play tactically, dice outcomes are usually against the old players. Also I lost my points many times by automatic reactivation of my account. This could be a bug or developer's trick to promote linking our FB accounts. So this is not an app meant for a fair game."

It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",

I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates. Thank you!",

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Games algorithm is made such a way that computer never let you win a game. After few games you lose interest playing losing games all the times. Edited: After the first review of mine they have changed my settings. Now it is truly random. Two star added. 😂",
            "Nice game. Liked it. Only thing is that it always makes me win. Not that I am disappointed, but it's strange that way. Always you win against the computer. In other ludo games, only the computer wins; however much we try. But it is really nice and easy. Good for children! I think it is better than others. It doesn't allow to play online but with local and computer it's very nice. Keep improving, all the best!!!",
            "It's a good game. I feel I am really playing ludo the last will be thrilling it's a good game. There a many games of ludo this is the best game the mb is low the game is excellent. The only thing I gave 4 stars is the game stucks in middle of the match I get irritated😖. Leaving that everything is superb. Install this game and enjoy😀",
            "Sometimes it doesn't feel as though the roll of the dice is random. Some of the computer generated 'players' would get 3 sixes in a row and I would get 5 ones. This not only made me think why should I bother, but also made the winner predictable early on. The number of times I could send a player home by landing on their square was nowhere near as many times as they would land on mine. Not saying I never won of course but it does seem disproportionate.",
            "I deleted my Real Ludo game , by Sally Love, which was years old.. But when I realized my error I was unable to even find it! So I tried a few more games but was unsatisfied until this game. I like the quickness of it's pace and the graphics are kinda nice, so I think I'll be keeping this Ludo and suggest you try it out for yourself."

I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "Can you fix the bugs like getting stuck in the ladder, teleport to the the sky,moves fast,goes through walls,cannot shoot,the fire button is gone,the fire button is going to be a parachute button and if I press the parachute button the fire button will going to be gone... But I really like the game... Can you make the map bigger? And make the red zone move slow",
            "Needs large improvement. The environment is good but the server can't handle more players. Sometimes it just picks me up from a match and drops me into another. Don't know why? Only the movement control works well, when the auto trigger is off you can't really play the game well. Additional voice conversation with other players will make the game more fun in Duo or Squad.",
            "Pleaze read, developer! I haven't played it but, it looks good and well made. But, some of the reviews said the graphics isn't really what it is in the pictures. So, I think developer, you should really fix that. And gameplay seems really good and fun, controls is fantastic, graphics uhhhh. Not sure about graphics so, imma edit this review later. You can get 4 Stars for effort! Oh, and! The reviews also said that the game lags like, LAG. So, fix that. Thank You for reading, developer.",
            "It's a good game I like it you want to fix offline play with bots It's a duplicate pubg.you want to fix voice conversation.it will be more fun i like very much this game. I didn't play Pugh or free fire. I saw the video of these games in youtube. I can't play these games. So I played this its my favourite battle Royale game thankyou",
            "Worst game I have ever played 1. It is extremely slow 2. Seriously the graphics is so bad 3. You cannot even match and enter immediately before you can play 1 game you need to match 5 times to play 4. The guns are totally useless seriously please fix these things else your game will be on the list of games that people do not even want to play and your effort will be wasted."

There are also many pictures of realistic paintings of ladies under the topic \"FASHION\"... But the reason why I rated this app four stars is that you need to pay money for a few pictures.. You need to pay money for all the zodiac signs and for most of the realistic painings of ladies... That is one my my complaints. Another one is that there are many ads😕",

            "It's okay but sometimes it's too many ads so I'm going to give it like a five wait no I'm going to give it a two because it's a little bad or maybe a one sorry guys please agree because this is a weird app too many ads and just some of the games are pretty hard and there's two new games so I hope you like it not me",
            "Terrible.... freaking horrible I have never played a game that has disappointed me this much. You win all the time but the win is not fair. The moves are made for losers and hope that no one downloads this game. If you are a fair winner then you won't download it. I wish there was something called as 0 stars, cause that is what the game deserves 😡🤬😠🤮",
            "It is a nice game but it also have some problems the problems I will tell you all listen first problem is that this game we can play only single we cannot play with our family members or friends second problem is in cross and zero game we only have to goal 3 same figure but in this game we have to match plus than 5 same figure third excuse is it brings add on every game we lose so I am rating this game four stars if you like my complement then please give a like 👍"

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

            "Used to look decent and work great, now it looks great and works decent. The new UI looks very clean and new, but it's difficult to recommend anymore because as of the new update, the Xbox remote function no longer works (almost) at all. If they fix it, then its basically 5 out of 5 stars and I'll update it. Until then, I don't have much use for it now except text friends on Xbox every now and then, and the occasional game clip",
            "The previous version of this app was wonderful. It had everything in easy to find places and was only missing the option to change your gamertag. In the current version, however, that is no longer true. The biggest two things that I can no longer find are where to access account settings, such as pfp and email, and I can't find my achievements anywhere. Nothing was even added to make up for this. They just removed some features and changed the app layout.",
            "With the latest update, the ui and simplicity of everything is nice; however, most of the main features that made the previous updates so great, were removed. The main purpose I downloaded this app, was to easily have access to my profile and check my achievements. Now that you can no longer do neither (other than being online/offline), it's useless to me. Disappointed.",
            "I do not like the latest update. It looks nice but the features I used previously are no longer available. Also, if I click on a friend's name from chat it gives me several options like delete, favorite, and unblock even if they aren't blocked. I clicked on unblock because I thought it was very weird that I had blocked my friend and thought I just have done it in accident. Clicking unblock actually blocked her. Luckily we figured that out pretty quickly. I wish I could uninstall the update.",
            "The removal of many features such as the store, redeeming codes, changing custom gamerpics and so on was an awful idea. I found the app difficult at times and slow but it worked for the most part, now it looks nice but key features for me personally are all gone. Hopefully they add these things back in the very near future as well as a bunch of other things. The new UI looks good for sure, but certainly wasn't worth losing so much for. Until then, 1 star is all it deserves in my opinion."

It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43–45 kg and females 36–38.5 kg. Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. As of 2005, 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), also known as the common wolf.\r\n\r\nThe gray wolf is the most specialised member of the genus Canis, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids. Its closest relative is the domestic dog, with which it shared a common European ancestor which likely diverged 14,900 years ago. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.\r\n\r\nwolf wallpapers for your phone or tablet!\r\n- This feature can tap on the screen and make the image immediately.\r\n- It has support for landscape mode and portrait mode switching screen.\r\n- Beautiful background free and fun are waiting for you!\r\nInstructions to install:\r\nHome - Menu -> Wallpapers.\r\nMovements and flashing light keeps changing with time.\r\n- You can choose from several different styles.\r\n- HD Graphics and Open GL\r\n- Battery usage optimization.\r\n- Compatible with 99% of mobile phone accessories.\r\n- wolf pictures fully supports landscape and look amazing on tablet devices.\r\nPlease contact us if you have any problems with our application.\r\n* Android is a trademark of Google.",

Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."
