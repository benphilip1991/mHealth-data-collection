Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone. Osteoporosis may be due to lower than normal bone mass and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss increases after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the hip.",

            "A nice app with lots of options to customise workouts and reps. Really glad for the voice that announces what move is coming next as I always forget and the beeps for each rep. Has helped tremendously in setting up a simple stretching routine to help with my recovery from a back injury.",
            "I've been using this app for my back for years. I didn't realise I hadn't rated it!! Great app. It's really helped me with my back pain as I have a bad posture. In particular I always use the \"Stretching the spine\" exercises.",
            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

        "description": "Determine your vitamin D level within a few minutes – easy, fast and at home\r\n\r\nThe combination of a rapid test and a smartphone app allows a fast and precise vitamin D level measurement within a few minutes. A video tutorial guides you step by step through the entire process. To perform the test, painlessly collect a blood sample from your fingertip and apply it to the test device. After a few minutes, the test device is scanned by using your smartphone camera. The special PREVENTIS SmarTest® Vitamin D app calculates the vitamin D concentration and immediately shows the result on the smartphone – in this way you can watch your vitamin D level by yourself and optimal adjust your vitamin D supplements.\r\n\r\nPlease find the list of supported smartphones (system requirements) and further information at: http://vitd.preventis.com/en/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVitamin D for your health\r\n\r\nVitamin D plays an important role in our metabolism, especially for bone health.

High cardiovascular risk is defined as a 10-year risk of 5% or higher. The guidelines of the fifth Joint Task Force of the European Societies on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention recommend use of the SCORE risk charts to calculate this risk.\r\n\r\nThe SCORE risk assessment is derived from a large dataset of prospective European studies and predicts fatal atherosclerotic CVD events over a ten year period. This risk estimation is based on the following risk factors: gender, age, smoking, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for high risk based on fatal cardiovascular events is defined as \"higher than 5%\", instead of the previous \"higher than 20%\" using a composite coronary endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis SCORE model has been calibrated according to each European country\\'s mortality statistics. In other words, if used on the entire population aged 40-65, it will predict the exact number of fatal CVD-events that eventually will occur after 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe relative risk chart may be used to show younger people at low total risk that, relative to others in their age group, their risk may be many times higher than necessary. This may help to motivate decisions about avoidance of smoking, healthy nutrition and exercise, as well as flagging those who may become candidates for medication.

When the \"roundness\" of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called kyphosis or \"hyperkyphosis\". Scheuermann's kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females.

With this application, both the Health Professional and the general public can check the ideal dosage of Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2 and Magnesium based on the exam parameters, or even just by body weight. The SmartD3 Application was developed by Life Medicine and Nutrition, and makes it possible to improve immunity, optimizing your Vitamin D3 levels and also improving the biochemical part involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D3 with the correct proportions of Vitamin K2 and Magnesium in relation to the dosage of Vitamin D3.\r\n\r\nExtremely useful and simple to use, SmartD3 has an optimized and intuitive interface. SmartD3 was developed based on versions of platforms already widely used in Germany. Several points of improvement were detected and from that a new version was developed using the most modern in this type of calculation, taking into account the proportions of dosages to raise the serum levels of vitamin D3 by 1 ng / ml, taking care to adjust the loss rate. All references and scientific data are available for consultation in the information and reference section, in the application itself.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES SMARTD3 WORK?\r\n\r\nSmartD3 helps you discover your need for optimal vitamin D3 supplementation. It is recommended that you first perform a vitamin D test. This is important so that you can validate your values. But you also have the option of checking the dosage closest to what you need through your weight.\r\n\r\nNote: The information and recommendations provided by SmartD3 are intended as preventive measures to prevent disease. The recommended dosages may vary for sick people. The requirements of pregnant women, nursing mothers, children and the elderly may vary. The information contained in the application is intended to serve as an aid and does not replace the advice of a doctor or clinical nutritionist.\r\n\r\nVITAMIN D FUNCTIONS IN THE BODY\r\n\r\nThe functions of vitamin D3 in the human body are numerous. Vitamin D3, for example, strengthens the cardiovascular system, affects the function of the thyroid gland and therefore also the hormonal balance and the immune system. Vitamin D3 also plays an important role in regulating your calcium level and therefore supports bone mineralization. An adequate level of vitamin D is therefore an important protection against osteoporosis. The promotion of muscle development and function is also related to vitamin D3. This is particularly important for older people, as they generally have a low level of vitamin D3. In addition, it supports the use of glucose, which is why vitamin D3 is particularly important for diabetics. Vitamin D3 is also known for its positive effects on the mood. Recent studies indicate that low levels of vitamin D3 are associated with mood swings and even depression.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles.

Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills.

When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic.

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

But the English one is the most natural, less robotic and even a bit naughty, especially when he says 'final squeeze ', love it!",
            "I started trying kegels due to semen retention practice. I am realising that the only way to do this consistently is to separate ejacultion and orgasm. I heard kegels help alot so tried to do them but wasn't consistent as I had no programme to follow. This app is great as it gives you daily exercises to do. I'm starting to feel a difference down there! 😉",
            "So, Ive been experiencing some bladder control issues recently and it was suggested to me I try kegals. This was the first app I came across and I'm glad I did. 2 weeks of daily use and I'm out of bladder leak undies. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend.",
            "I needed an app that could remind me daily to do Kegel after the birth of my son and this is it!! I used it while nursing him and it takes no effort! The level 1 would definitely work for beginner and it seems that it goes gradually.. Looking forward to see how the next levels go.."

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "Absolutely love the App. So easy to use and so much more fun than doing it on my own. I had lots of fun exercising with different voices all the other languages too! But the English one is the most natural, less robotic and even a bit naughty, especially when he says 'final squeeze ', love it!",
            "I started trying kegels due to semen retention practice. I am realising that the only way to do this consistently is to separate ejacultion and orgasm. I heard kegels help alot so tried to do them but wasn't consistent as I had no programme to follow. This app is great as it gives you daily exercises to do. I'm starting to feel a difference down there! 😉",
            "So, Ive been experiencing some bladder control issues recently and it was suggested to me I try kegals. This was the first app I came across and I'm glad I did. 2 weeks of daily use and I'm out of bladder leak undies. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend.",
            "I needed an app that could remind me daily to do Kegel after the birth of my son and this is it!! I used it while nursing him and it takes no effort! The level 1 would definitely work for beginner and it seems that it goes gradually.. Looking forward to see how the next levels go.."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

        "description": "The survival shooter Last Day on Earth is set in a post apocalyptic world: in 2027 the world saw an outbreak of an unknown infection that destroyed almost all the human race. And it didn’t stop there. All those dead started turning into zombies and those few survivors that have resistance in their blood are trying to survive on the ruins of the once great world.\r\n\r\nAnd now the survival of your character is only in your power! Keep an eye on your character’s life stats such as hunger and thirst, collect valuable resources for crafting, create weapons and transport of different types or use what you have at hand: a bat or a road sign. Everything will come in handy for killing dozens... hundreds…thousands of zombies!\r\n\r\nDefeat intruders to your land not only with your power but also cunning – construct fortifications with traps or go raid other survivors’ territories for the sake of rare loot and resources. After all people can do anything to survive. \r\n\r\nHardcore fans will have plenty to do in tough seasonal locations. Before going to a desperate trip, equip your survivor with the most crushing weapon to hunt wild animals and destroy crowds of mutated zombies. One can reach seasonal location on a transport that’s available for crafting. Moreover if you pass the wall on the west of the map you will enter an online location where with a special costume on, you will be able to interact with other players. \r\n\r\nExplore the large and deep-laid world of Last Day on Earth! Upgrade your hero, equip your house, loot abandoned territories, hunt wild animals and other survivors – the new world has new rules. \r\n\r\nWill you survive in conditions like these? If so, what price are you ready to pay?",

I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard. (Not all) > Don't forget to enjoy!!! #ComeToOurClanWeDoHelpEachOther. III % (Clan Name)"

            "Just like 'The Blackest Night' (classic DC comic book.) So excited when I unlocked both Spectre (original) and Doctor Fate! Also, it's like Final Fantasy IV and V but better graphics... Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",
            "Gameplay has become fantastic since the last update. Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence. I have earned over 30 million essence but still haven't finished it up yet. But the legendary essence is getting finished quickly. Please resolve this issue.",
            "such a great game to play, even without in-app purchases. Down fall is, glitches during power-ups, exits app during battle or during a game purchase. Fix the huccups :( even after this little update, game still cuts out during game play. Really sad, I'd like a refund",

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

            "It's a great app but every time I'm reading things if I scroll down it scrolls back up and I have to keep scrolling down just to read a little bit more then it scrolls back up it's really annoying to the point I don't even like to read comments anymore 😑",
            "It was one of the the best app among the others few years back. Used it for my pregnancy 3 years ago. Now for my second pregnancy downloaded it and all could see is unwanted upgrading ads ,every article i open requires a premium upgrade. Looks like all it cares about is how to make money.its super super annoying. Uninstalling it.",
            "Kinda hard to navigate and constantly pulling up the premium ads. Deleted it ultimately because every time i tried to read about my week; i was confounded by stories of miscarriage that triggered my anxiety over previous loss and got me scared and worried. I started not using it and then deleted over that.",
            "I love this app, and truly feel that the premium option is worth it. Many people are quick to dismiss paid for apps, but they forget the team behind the platform, which lead me through when I didn't want to conceive, to now - half way through my pregnancy. I get excited to check my daily update on my pregnancy journey: supported by great articles relating to every single day of pregnancy, and a community to chat with, along with smart analysis. Thanks Glow, keep up the great work!",
            "This is a pretty good app for being free besides all the ads to upgrade. I can log things I do like water intake, if I take my prenatal, how much sleep I get, etc. It also gives updates about my baby and what stage he/she is in and each week compares its size to food 😄 I like that there are articles I can read and there are other people in the same stage at me on this so it's like we're all in this together ❤"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

Its nice that there is a calendar to keep track of your progress. Not too sure is calories burned is correct since every person is different, but still a good motivation tool. Morning, Afternoon and Evening is a plus as is multiple other categories ."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "EDIT: there needs to be some kind of confirmation when spending gems. I just magically lost 25 gems and I don't know how ORIGINAL: It feels like the game is designed to keep non paying players poor. Many of the garden quests are not possible to complete without paying, and to skip them, you have to pay a month's worth of gems. The events are the same: impossible to complete without paying. The game itself is fun, I just wish they didn't make it so difficult to move forward if you don't pay",
            "Do not, I repeat do not! buy the golden pass. Its a rip off. Even though it says golden pass at each season, you can only use it for one season and then you have to repay to be able to keep using it. €5,50 is much for an option that would stay. But it's unbelieveably expensive for something that only works for one season... I either want my money back or I want to have the feature unlocked forever. Your choice Gram.",
            "Very addicting. But if i may make a suggestion on a useless feature? The screen lock is pointless, and the button is in a poor location. Having a screen lock feature on a game that requires you to move the screen doesn't make sense. But if it needs to be in the game, i suggest relocating its button. I' ve turned that thing on so many time just because an item appears in the bottom of the screen close to it. But other than that very good game",
            "I wish I could get more compasses by watching videos more often I would totally watch them to play more levels. It allows me to do it sometimes but in other games it is unlimited ad=more play, instead I have to wait a whole hour to get another compass to keep playing? That doesn't make sense. But I do love the game, it is addicting and fun to merge stuff. I just wish I could play for longer.",
            "So far a very fun game, althoughIhaven'tbeen playingbut about one week. The only downside that I have found so far is that if you want to play & collect items, you better bring your credit card to the table. The only way to get what you need and/or desire is to pay for it. All items (eggs, buildings, plants, etc) go up in price every time you expand or purchase it."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "This is the worst game ive ever played. I dont recommend this game to anyone. This took me 4 hours to download litteraly 1 percent every 2 minutes, then i get the worst possible experience of my life. Also, ads every single level and usually i instantly die because theres 6 wheel spikes at the very beginning not timed right to be possible. I dont care what you do to this game, im never playing it again.",

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "The game is good, there's an offline mode and online mode, but to be honest, I like the old version of bomber friends especially the offline mode and I have a reason for it, 1. you don't have to pay diamonds or gems to upgrade your stats unlike the updated version",
            "This is a really good game. Multiplayer battles are of three types reversi, classic and team battles. There are also two dungeons and adventure modes, clan events and arena battles. It's really fun and there is 100% no lag (if there is that's your WiFi problem). I highly recommend all of you to download this game.",
            "Good but way too many be adverts when you first start the game and between levels before getting the bonus and watching an ad for double bonuses. Even failing some levels triggers a long ad you can't skip. This totally be ruins the flow of the game. Less ads would be better. Controls can be unresponsive at times leading to frustrating deaths also icons on the left too large with controls covering them they should be moved. Buff icon bomb kick too small easy to lay a bomb when trying to kick",
            "Hi I just wanted to bring to your attention that I lost so many points in Area Battle and I can't believe how fast they move and swap me in over the other side and walking through my bombs? I believe the players maybe using cheat code on me. Any ways you can investigate this problem and could I have my last 16 games points back that I lost so quickly by the players cheat code?",
            "After 4 years been playing this game.. Such enjoyable game but this time after the previous update..they came out with new boom/weapon what that called, and its not good and become ridiculous. Id like more for the old one before update, i have to uninstall it coz by the update not suitable for me and yeah gonna miss this game so much."

            "I love this game and have been playing pretty much since it came out,however I have some concerns,I have gotten the short end on some plays,for example birds will sometimes go away sooner than they should and have lost out on points,jewels,etc,one of my biggest issues is items landing on pigs without popping them,this happens ALOT,and certain levels you get 3 feathers etc.and just weird numbers,rewards should be more, but do love game,look forward to improvements.",
            "Normally a great game but the levels (500 or more) are all ki generated and then its not really fun anymore. You loose in a game, try it again and it's built totally different than before. It's like you're playing the same level every 20 levels again and that really takes the fun, sadly :/",
            "Very nice game. Some individual free hats are stray&poisonous. Like Park Ranger Hat(update in sept).U willn't get hats for all birds, remaininng hats U have to buy frm hat shop at very higher cost( black gems). This hat set will not rise power of Ur sungshot by 3, only by 1 & birds power by 1. Now 'Calavara' hat started. (See hat shop). Also rewards are poisonous. After playing, U search for rewards, but in vail. U just download & play. I have 2 games in my mob, so 2 five stars. TC Suresh.",
            "Way way way too many updates. And every update is a requirement to play the game. That is a lot of bandwidth you force people to use, instead of a simple patch. So you either wait for an opportunity to use wifi, or eat the data usage. Besides that, the game is fun to play, but there are now way too many facets to it. You can opt not to play all of it, which is nice, but the interface is extremely cluttered now.",
            "This game is actually really fun and addictive. But the fact that to really progress you have to spend money is a drawback. Hats to strengthen the slingshot/birds cost black pearls which are won mostly in small increments. Gems are the same, if you want to continue in any element of the game you have to pay. Continue once 60 gems, twice 180. You get 5 lives, run out? Pay gems. Stamps? Can't even win in game have to buy. Other than that, it's fun."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Really fun game. Huge variety of units to buy. Love the offline earnings aspect of the game, which helps offset the huge cost of leveling them up. Each stage last under 5 minutes so you can rapidly advance through stages. Although it can be difficult, especially boss stages. Well worth a download.",
            "Whoever thought of the concept of Towerlands, certainly knew how to think outside the box. An extremely unique concept and gameplay style. Haven't had the crashing issues other players have experienced (Phone: Samsung S9, Samsung A5). The English translations are oddly done, but they have a unique charm to them that I've grown to appreciate. Ads aren't intrusive, and you can easily save up gold while not playing. Premium transactions are way overpriced; I'm definitely willing to pay otherwise.",
            "Had to edit my rating, the game is currently unplayable. Try to load it and if I'm lucky enough to have the game load once I click to to anywhere it immediately crashes. I have sent crash report explained in detail what has happened. Hope this gets fixed soon, I do enjoy the game but haven't been able to log in for many days now.",
            "You beat wave 4000 and the game crashes, the game shows you are on 4001 but you are still on 4000 and cannot beat it, since it will alwaya crash. It happens for everyone who is that far. I will cancel my membership, this is the worst bugged game I've seen so far. The rankings are bugged since the beginning and the devs do nothing...",
            "I've loved the game so far but for the past three days I have not been able to launch the game past the loading screen. It sort of bugs out and goes back to my phones home screen. Any answers to when this could be fixed so I can continue?? Edit: has been working great, love the game 🙏🏻"

            "Not even worth half a star. For one, the game is a poor excuse for a bootleg Clash Royale rip-off. Second the game developers failed at the match making system because you end up going against players as much as 3 levels higher with very strong cards. There is no strategy other than paying for the cards with your money. Pay to win game. See how little the developers care about the fanbase, because there are no responses. Why? Because it is an obvious sign that they are just in it for money. Sad.",
            "The game is great, UI is awesome. It lags sometime but that can be due to your internet connection as well. What i hated about this game doesn't have a \"level playing field\". The randomness of opening any card from the chest during play is not the right way to go about this game! It provides a luck factor which is not ideal for a strategy based game like CC. What can we do instead: start the chest with the least maina cards first and after all the 12 cards are opened, then do a random shuffle!!",
            "Love this game. Been playing for a long time but it could use at least one update other than the rebalancing of characters abilities. I am at level 11 but can be beaten by a level 6? Ridiculous. Plus, honestly, I prefer the daily games more, but that does not ever increase my castle level. Ridiculous! Overall I am addicted, but I would rather not keep giving my money away for no real benefit.",
            "The game is good. Graphics are good, characters are good. The problem is that it happens many times that match do not get start even though I have a stable Internet connection. And in a clan when we try to battle, it do not enter me in match and i lost the match. It is quite annoying. Fix it and i will give you 5 stars.",
            "Now I played for about a Month, the tournament is around. STOP❗ .... Game not worth it. Can't compete if you don't have the Super High Powered Cards to win. Don't get me wrong the game is fun if on Regular Mode, great match making. BUT The game chooses cards randomly. Your opponent can get there best cards first. While you get your Higher Seed Cards. I Repeat, I Repeat, \"There is No Strategy to this game\" -- The Higher Payer wins❗"

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "Grow castle is an amazing game. They are constantly fixing bugs and adding new enemies and hero's to the game. They have clans so you can play multiplayer and chat with other people about the game and you can continue having fun for a long time as they have dragon/boss fights that continue up to months past you're download of the game. It can be played competitively and casually and overall it's a game that I think everyone should download at least once. I think they should add more music.",
            "I like this because there is not adds. The only time there are adds is if you need coins. If you are also tired of playing these other games that are the same then play GrowCastle . Its fun and active you can join groups and try to be the best group. I play Growcastle when I am bored. I like this game a lot so i think you shuold play it. This is why I am giving it a 5 star rating",
            "Ive played this game for years, and still enjoy playing it. Im on wave somewhere in the thousands now and i still enjoy it. Even at big levels its not really grindy and there isnt many ads at all and you almost have to pay for nothing other than a few things. Though i would really like some new game macanics like just more heros or maybe more things to fight. But more than that there should maybe be more town stuff. I would like more stuff that gets unlocked and changes the game more often.",
            "This game is the best RPG game-type ever! This game has no add pop-ups at ramdom time which is like Tap Titans 2. You must watch an add if needed 3× game speed or free coins. I play this game Grow Castle if I'm bored playing other games. This game makes me addicted like literally can't stop playing this game all day! I love the graphics, controls and even the gameplay! I'd rate this a 5 star for this game! 🤩",
            "I'd say its fun, really simple when you start and once you understand the game it gets more complicated which is great because you don't get overwhelmed. its well paced and a good game to get if you're just looking to try something new. especially because it's not littered with ads you can't avoid. all ads are optional."

The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

One thing is that chests have an unplentif amount coins so maybe put a bit more coins in chests. Anyway good game, A plus graphics, a new Bat? I could never think of that!",
            "It's an fun and very addicting game, but I get matched with players 10 × my level. I'm on level 1 right now since I've just been introduced to it. I can't play the game due to the fact that I am dead in a matter of 15 - 20 seconds. My teammates will not give me a chance to grab the weapons either. Also, the items are a bit overpriced. I will redownload this game once these issues are resolved.",
            "When i subscribe to a weekly subscription, it's fail to showing me that i subscribe. I restore purchase many times, sometimes work and sometimes not working. I contact help disk and he bretend that my subscription is over, while i just took one day for 7 days !! It's a joke. There are alot of hackers whom I can't report!!! Believe or not, you cannot report them. He can kill as much he can, and no one can stop him. Please Don't waste your time and money, until they fix there issues!",
            "Game is very addicting but clearly pay-to-win, you cant play without it. My problem was that after I made a purchase, the game stopped loading. \"Something went wrong\" everytime I logged in. I tried to get a refund but no response. Very unhappy, I had high hopes seeing the advertisements but it's a RIP off!",
            "Great game I have about 9 character and they are just great this game is my most greatest game that I have. Just asome. Update, it's been about 2 years since I gotten a new character. It starts to get boring and I haven't played some time. Every timei get a golden crate, I always expect nothing out of it. Dont get your Hope's up. Look at me I got bored of a game that I loved for soooooo long and. It's starting to make me feel like why did I get this game. The point is the character percentage."

I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

Then, with 128 Gb sd-card, or cloud storage, it would be unstoppable!",
            "I kinda wish this app was more like Microsoft's calculator since, even though I love the simplicity of this calculator bit it I don't want to be downloading other apps to have a scientific calculator, or a calculator for volume or whatever it is, basically saying that this should have more features than it just being super simple.",
            "It works, bit I find so much is pointless to a basic user, I don't need scientific mode on 100% of the time, and I'd like M+/- buttons instead of having to mess with copy and paste. Give us a basic and scientific button to toggle between the modes.. PS to the people complaining about the clear, press and hold the backspace button and it will clear",
            "OK, but a waste of memory since I have to download another calc app for converting F°/C°, gal/litr and ft/mm etc. Samsung has that inbuilt. So there's is better. I don't use the scientific operations, so looking at them all the time is visual clutter. VERY ugly app. Lastly, in all that clutter you can't give us a memory +/recall key OR a simple clear/all clear key. You know, keys that are found in just about EVERY calculator anyone has ever used EVER. /smh",

            "I really like this game it's been 4 years that I'm still playing it, well the game changed so much and everything get even more better, more fantastic and nice, im still playing it and I really like it cus of the gameplay and everything, well it takes much to explain why I like it, but I suggest people for downloading it and u will love it.",
            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",
            "I really like this game,but sometimes i really always logging idk why im not full storage,i have 16GB and idk why this is happening in my cellphone but tnx qlot IGG games i still loving and playing this game but i dont like in this game i always loggong and quiting automatically,But i will always love this game but i will rate thia only 4 sorry IGG but i st8ll love your games..",
            "I love this game, but what the actual F. Lost connection? I spent 3 hours on a base design. 4 bars wifi. Perfect connection. All that base progress is gone. That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",

And the thought put into the game, occasional updates, making sure it isn't buggy, deserves a 6 star if possible.",

        "comments": [
            "Fun game. If there are ads, I never noticed them... completely unobtrusive. And you can literally play for years without spending a penny of real money. The only downsides for me was the ultimate boredom in trying to get the last few spaces on the board, it takes too long. And the weekend events, while giving great rewards, will take nearly every minute of your weekend days to complete. I finally gave up trying to finish the game and uninstalled, but I would recommend giving it a go.",
            "I really enjoy playing the game (only reason why I gave 3 stars), however it keeps coming out of the game and forgetting my progress. Also, things get expensive the further in you go, and I've only been playing it for less than a week! Today by forgetting my progress, it lost me some treasures I would have used to get dragon eggs, which is the only way to advance the game. Ads take me out of the game. Ultimately I'm frustrated with the game and am considering finding something else 😬😒☹️😡😟",
            "The camp economy needs redone. I have to pay gems for everything I work for, and what I receive is not valuable. I opened a level 5 chest, and only received 145 coins and nothing else. The two stars are only there because of the memories when I played this years ago. I know you guys can improve. I don't want to have to switch to a different merge game. P.S. Accidents are fatal. For example, when you're going for a high level item and then merging 3 objects instead of 5.",
            "Such a great game! Graphics are amazing and it's great puzzling fun. One suggestion I have is to make a lock or pinned feature for objects, so they're not as easy to move around if you don't want them to. I also suggest some kind of warning or countdown for when the special events are ending. I like to collect everything at the end, and I tend to lose track of time. I didn't get anything I worked hard for for three days... so annoyed, and it's my own fault but wow. A little notice would be nice",
            "This is a good game to sink time into when nothing else is going on. What I don't like is that purple stars are imposible to get unless you spend real money. I haven't had a purple star drop in more than two months... And I can't justify the cost to buy the gems with real money. It would be nice to have a trade option to purchase the gems with things earned through game play. I'm stuck on some quests because of this \"feature.\""

One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "This game is so fun, But there are always adds playing, but its worth it, this is a very fun game!! I hate the mask thing!!! It is a blast! But one thing I don't like is whenever I watch ads to earn better things I always loose to the other team, I tried both teams ballet and Hip hop, but I keep 💯 loosing. :) and dont tell me to stay safe,😡",
            "Very good app! I love how you can dress yourself and everything! The only problem is almost everything is locked. Makeup, clothes, dance moves, and more. That's how the game get boring.. I mean, what the point?! You can got to the doctor , spa , or take a selfie.. All you can really do is put makeup on, go to the gym, dress up, and do dance moves all over again! I do the ballet and I am getting tired of using the same dresses again.. (Turn off WiFi if too many ads)OTHERWISE, GOOD APP!!!!!!!",
            "I really used to like Coco games☺ until I was wanting to get the full version of the game , so I clicked on it and it was $9.99 .Really?!?!😑And almost everything costs money 😒😾Also when I was playing the game I was going against Hip-hop we got a higher number then they did but Hip-hop won!😡Are number was 3,444,589 and Hip-hop got 900😐 I would give it 5 stars if it did not lie.😠😡😡😡",
            "I would 100% recommend! Grate app. When I'm bored I love playing this game, it makes me love dance even more! Also amazing job to whoever made this game :) oh and, other people are saying there's to many adds? Maybe it is just their device. On my device (iPad) I don't get many. Thank you for taking the time to make this game!",
            "Okay I absolutely LOVE this game. I love how you can choose Hip Hop or Ballet. They are both amazing. I just wish that more things would be unlocked for free, or at least like \"Watch 5 videos to unlock!\" or something. But if you're look for something fun to play and pass time, ( It's especially useful during Covid-19) I reccomend this game."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable.

It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",

            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "If your looking for a good time killer this is a great game. Im at level around 3800 and nothing has changed. Same weapons and same levels over and over again. Ads around every corner. Whats worse all the coins you collect to optimize the weapons have zero effect on the weapons. Ill tell you now, anything you do in this game wont count for anything! Levels just go higher, but not harder. Coins mean nothing, points you get for pushing people off mean nothing, achievements mean nothing.",
            "I paid to remove ads and get a special skin. I'm still getting a ton of ads and received nothing. There's no help menu.",

As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "This game is so cool and fun but the problem is that we cannot unlock hairstyles, frocks and so many things. It just made annoyed and disappointed 😔. And when we try to unlock it, it asks for money. Please fix this and make it all free with no money. If fix this problem I WILL GIVE 5 STARS. But overall this game is good and I love it 😊.",
            "I absolutely HATE this game, it's just terrible, I haven't even had it for 1 hour before I deleted it. The game has an add every 10 seconds, literally. It is also very laggy, and when I tried to create the skirt it makes you pull the entire fabric over and in the end it looks like trash, so I would rate this a 0 star if I could, You are Welcome.",
            "Hello...Myself Nidhi... This is a very nice game....Only the problem is toooooo much of adds and if google add will come then we can't go again to the game...we should clear that game and then go again...Plz update and fix this problem...I dont need adds.... Is it online....Plz tell me.... If this add problem goes then it can be 4 or 5 stars.... Nice game then👌",
            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall 👍👍",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

Hospital, photo booth and spa is locked. My suggestion will be to not download the game. Coco play games are good but if they will unlock every thing and make new games then it will be good. I have uninstalled it. If you already downloaded then delete it.",
            "Nice games but so many locked dresses ,makeup , hairstyles , hair colour ,etc . it's ok we can unlock by watching adds but what about the dance moves ,spa and hospital we have to buy only . That's why I had given only 3 stars . My request is there that unlock some dance moves and keep some to buy at least keep 3-4 moves . About spa and hospital you keep two options 1. To buy and get it . 2. Keep 20 or 15 ads to watch and then unlock . It's better if you keep like this way .",
            "This game is really fun and all but at my FIRST performance I kept hearing somebody whisper something like \"press that\" but it was creepy. I also hate that you have to unlock a load of stuff",
            "I hope you add more clothes, shoes, hairstyles, nail arts, accessories, stage designs and music if this isn't for free so we could at least enjoy more even not having full version. Make it worth the pay if possible to those who purchased it too. IF NOT, we can watch ads to unlock everything and get access to it (while you still earning back from it.) I love to play the full version but paying for full version when it's still lacking, its not worthwhile. Thank you.",

And make up💋and hair salon💇 and restaurant 🍔🥗🍹🍰☕and gym and it also includes clinic 💉💊🩺 and photo booth and spa but they are locked. After ready ballerina we have to go to competition .

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "It's good but I give 3 stars⭐⭐⭐. First have so many ads, second it's only click the screen, if you do events like Halloween🎃👻🍬 that help the game but it's cool idea",
            "The game really sucks and they need to fix it by that has like five seconds the same ad comes up like wow Pls fix this problem 😔 I'm not going to play it if it stays like this guys",
            "The reason I put five star is because you can get heaps of stars in a short amount of time and it has a reasonable amount of ads and it's just a fun clicker game",
            "Its an awsomd game that you can play offline i wish i could give this game a 100 stars the graphics are amazing it's just all round an awsome game",

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

        "description": "The Division of Rheumatology at the University of Cape Town is very actively involved in teaching, service delivery and research.\r\n\r\nTeaching is directed at medical students in their 4th 5th and 6th years of training. There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Collaborative research is being carried out with the Liver Unit to study bone density in auto-immune hepatitis.",

        "description": "Problems with the spine such as osteoporosis can lead to back pain.\r\nThe human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain.

            "For the most part this game is fun and I love the animals. However, I am sick of the World cups events they force players to play. The purpose I get. The game makers want to create more levels. That world cup would possibly be cool if I reached max level and still wanted to play. I am three levels from maxing out and can only play a night or two during the week and weekends. At least once a month they put on a world cup during the only time I can play. I am considering deleting the game.",
            "In my opinion, not only is this game extremely entertaining for ALL ages, but the graphics are nice and I believe that through this game and others you have created will remind everyone how precious the flora and fauna truly is on the Earth and be better stewards of it from now on. I'm sure that wasn't the original premise that you thought of when you designed the game, but my experience has given me an appreciation of what we have around us. Great job y'all and keep 'em coming. BRAVO !!!!",
            "Great game. Starting to get really challenging.its getting better and better, I love the way there are so many ways to match and cause big bangs. Have come back to this game and wow just wow. It has been upgraded and updated. It looks much slicker and the graphics are chunkier, if that makes sense. Really enjoying it and I'm enjoying setting up the zoo. I'm now on level 886 and I am missing my little helpers so much. I've seen this game develop into a really great one so please bring them back",
            "Fun, with enjoyable graphics and gameplay, until I hit level 70. Been stuck for over a day now, use my lives up so fast, and it takes 20 mins to get a single life back. Might uninstall due to apparently impossible level. Also, playing with a friend, and we have seemingly random/different decorations and levels, and unlock things differently. Very odd. If the level is made easier/lives regen faster & stuff made slightly less random will give 5 stars",
            "I really like this game, it can be quite challenging on some levels but I find eventually you get through. I have bought extras for it but I feel you don't need to buy diamonds and power ups which I think is great. Would definitely recommend it as a fun destressing game."

            "Too much ads!! I mean, I'm okay with some ads here and there, but this one has too much! It's pathetic!. Every. Single. Level. Has ads! Even when I get to watch an ad for a free pass, after I get pass the level, another ad appears! Fix this game, this deserves better.",
            "I like it and had fun but it made me install one more app and there are adds. I only have one game without adds and I think they should have less adds although it is a fun game over all. I definitely think kids of all ages should play this game. This is an honest review and I really hope doing this helped you. Have a great day. Happy Halloween.",
            "Because you get adverts every 2 seconds and there's men naked and my child is playing this and she says Mummy doesn't need it now and I'm like and it's just it's just complicated and basically I don't get why anyone ever would up like this game and it would know why I rated it 2 stars 0 stars is this game keep carrying on I will I will lose my mind and it will not be or I will never do I will I will like girls go crazy and it will not know for every bone in my body is telling me to let go",
            "A small in game fit in a Bunch of Ads.. TOO MANY ADS It is one of the most pathetic games i might have played. Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",
            "Well I was playing the game and there were so many ads and there 30 seconds ads😠. Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk. But if none of this happens to you then your lucky."

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "The game is great. My problem is that I had a glitch where I couldn't complete a game.I matched everything but no win. I sent a message and told them and mentioned that I lost 300 coins playing this game 3 times. They fixed it, but I guess they don't reimburse for their glitches. 2nd thing, now they have a survey going. 200 coins. I could use it. Takes 15 minutes. It finally says thanks you you now have the 200 coins. Well I didn't get it. Tried again. No coins. Asked for help twice. Nada",
            "Love this game, however since yesterday on every game I play, once I've cleared the board completely I have to use one of my help options to end the round. Not sure if this is a glitch or what. I hope this gets fixed, or I will need to stop playing and delete. I am updating my review, the previous has been fixed and now my game back to working as normal. I really appreciate the fast turnaround on this. Other than that, this game is fun, and relaxing... love it.",
            "It is fun, some stages more challenging than others. Sometimes items get stuck and you need to use a cheat to get them quick enough not to lose your bonus. Only thing is, there's a piggy bank that's full that you can't use for anything but you can unlock a bigger piggy bank but why??? There's no purpose to it??? I would love the ability to do a shared board with a friend.",
            "I like the game but like others I have issues: 1) ads which can't be muted. I don't care for the political ads, wish to mute. 2) Items on the sides being hard to grasp, agree. I started using a stylus. Easier. 3) I still have no idea what the coins are for as most things in the game cost money, not coins; I'm not sure why the amount of coins reset either, what's the point? I haven't reached the level some have mentioned where there are \"ghost\" pieces though. That'll likely change my rating.",
            "Originally I gave this game 5 stars. I have cancelled that because I now only get times in the 5 minute range. Gets very boring now. Same time continually. What happened? Also agree about too many adds. Not enough time given to actually playing the game. More time spent waiting for ads to go by. I never watch them. Fixed the 'same time' problem. Deleted game for a while. Then downloaded it again. Did this a couple of times until the times changed. OK for now anyway. Problem Ads the same."

Most of the skins are bad but the only good ones are the impossible ad ones. And some of the obstacles kill you even if you duck or dodge it. Worst of all, I hit in the green zone on an epic level and got killed somehow.",
            "Very poor game not satisfied plus has too many ads a irritating game.I was just playing level 24 it started flickering and I don't understand what is the need of epic level . Epic level is just like this just for coins.Coins we can collect while winning. I am angry due to so many ads after each level ad. For opening chest room ad. For new skin ad , means this game is filled with ads and I don't like the games which have ads.I am not satisfied with the game and. I wanted to give zero stars to it.",
            "Experience on this game is amazing you can get so much out there you can get new Skins and it can sort teach you how to be more skilled to but the game is quite buggy the game is kind of different it's not a normal game and I would not recommend this game well I would but but if you ever played this game I'm sure you feel same way but all you need to do right now is just download the app",
            "If ads pop up, just turn of your WI-FI or Mobile Data, that way you won't get any ads at all. That will make the game less laggy too! I love this game, it's interesting, and quite funny too. I rate it 5 stars.",
            "I rate this Five because this is cool for me i don't mind it the ads. The ads it's little, i like this game i love so much i think i'm up too 100 but it's fine this game i like it."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

So she just clicks around until it lets her move on. Since we do this through school, I asked her teacher to reset her level, but she doesn't know how. So she emailed customer support and recieved NO RESPONSE. pretty crazy since you know the school is paying for it. ABC Mouse is way better and way more fun.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",

It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",

The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",

But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",

Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4.

            "Now, the attack speed is kinda bad and we need a dodge. The game isn't that bad, well, i think it cpuld be a bit better. Like; we need more naruto villains, more types of show characters, and a better name for gohan. Yes, i know it's kinda hard finding good names for characters while also trying to avoid copyright, but still. I also feel like the game is a pay to win, so try to make it so you get characters while playing the game and beating them. Take xenoverse for example. So yeah, 3 stars.",
            "This game is super nice. But my points is the characters are way too expensive. Please reduce the price. I love you♥ you are the best.and one last thing. When I finish defeating my oppent and he falling I want to kick him down. Add that for me. And as in the picture two people were throwing their power and both of the power hit in the middle to see who power is strong. Will add that please. Anyone reading this you should download this game. Is the Best★♡♥★♥♡》》",
            "This game is Divine Perfection!Also, it would be nice if you put the ultra instinct weave effect.Keep up the good work!:) Nevermind I'm giving this game one star, I got locked out of my account, got it back, AND THE GOOGLE LOGIN DOESN'T EVEN WORK! SO NOW I CAN'T GET MY DATA BACK!I'm very sorry for the outlash, u deserve the five stars since it is not easy to make a game and I can just grind it back. Also thanks for replying because now I know that my problem is not a lost cause......👁️👄👁️",
            "Hi devs! I loved the game! But i have noticed something wrong, why does my foes was too easy to eliminate .-. I want an smarter one...i want a AI bot that can dodge our skills and can shields our skills. Thats will be more interesting. And why does all of the heroes had Goku's voice? You should make them their own voices. Pls add options/settings and settings or options for control layout and change controls. Why does naruto can fly? And why is his rasengan is looks like lava? Change it pls thx",
            "LOVELY game to play indeed; sound effects, environment,graphics could take a bit more improvements but the characters so far i'm really enjoying them playing this game already i really am. Its almost like i'm playing on the actual Xbox or PS4 console the only difference is this time the video game is in 2D and not 3D but as said the graphics and so forth adds up to every other features of the game. Keep it up developer i'm giving your content 4 stars for right now."

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

And, Who Doesn't like a wee-bit of Candy?!? Like they say, \"Always remain a Kid at Heart.\", I believe in that!! This Willy Wonka slots is just Brilliant & Lively to Play. It has other Awards that you can win throughout the game, little side games you could say, in which all adds to your \"coins\". Great Work peeps, in the Making of this game!🍭🍬🍫👻",
            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",

Mind blowing and very very outstanding app. HAs a lot of features like dark mode light mode and i recommend everybody to download it. The reason for giving 4 stars is it is missing one thing. Literally this file manager is missing one thing that many people. Literally it does not have Root explorer. After a few months of my old review they have even added root explorer now. Now you deserve 5 stars man. LOVE",

My only problems are every once in awhile I'll tap the screen one time & two canon balls SHOOT out causing the second one to hit the border and destroying my shooter. Then you get a choice of either starting over or watching a 30 second ad which runs any kind of flow you have. Which gets frustrating after awhile!! 3/5",

But the most recent update with banner ads during gameplay interfere with what you can see, and dims the screen (except for the banner ad!) such that you can't even see it. On an s10e if that matters...",

They dont make games for the players they make games for the ads. -10/100",

            "Ever since the recent update an ad will pop up right over in the middle of game play & freeze the game. The only thing I can do is force close it. I like the game please fix this ad thing. I don't mind them between levels, but during the game seconds in? It's just annoying because I can't even play."

Wish more games would have this kind of setup. The developer did a wonderful job. The information is accurate and allows for easy access to multipliers and multiple maps. Always adds to my Ark experience in the best way possible.",
            "My friend used this app and now I can understand his gibberish by using this. It's got alot of good info in here ARK won't readily tell you and it sure changed how I played. Some of those Dinos I ignored...amazing! It also includes recipes which I really needed. My only complaint is how the mobile users info gets thrown in, making some info inconsistent.",
            "I personally love ark, and this app is a MUST HAVE for all survivors. Whether you play for fun, like me, or competitively, or even to see how much you're pc/console can handle, this app is for you, as it has kibble recipes, taming calculators, level spread calculators, and an extremely funny and helpful community",
            "it's very helpful in taming dino but can you also add some more features like for hunting dino how much ammo you will need like you show for taming and all the recipies for not only kibble but others also like guns and more and also can you show engrams which can unlock at which level because in ark mobile you can only see engrams which are going to unlock and rather than that the app is best and op keep it up",
            "I'm still learning new things every day on Ark, this ap has made life so much easier. the calculations will need to be adjusted (go to settings) to the server you play on. It calculates tame levels, tame knock out requirements, recipies, everything you'd need to know about what ever tame your hunting for. It also has a comment helping section, real players can comment on helpful tips about how they knocked out that tame."

            "Kinda fun until level 59. Then you basically have to fill the entire board with the highest level plant. Which is nearly impossible as the board fills. Fun game play up until that point but that gouge for money at the end has me wary of anything else these guys make. Level 60 is the final level so they do it to you right at the end. Not worth it at that point, trust me.",
            "I got to phase 7. What happened?? Plants VS Zombies at least had a story, cheesy tho it was. This one just tedious. But I deleted because of the ads. I mute the music and the effects. What makes you think I want to hear the stupid ads? I have to search out on each one where they've placed the mute, if they put it there at all.",
            "Fun and a good time waster. I love the many different plants when leveling up. There are many ways to earn extra coins and plants. You just have to be a little patient due to ad breaks. But all in all it's a good game.",
            "It's fun and addictive just gotta chill on some of the adds like the gold coins you obtain and spend for killing take the add off of the buying plants on that it's terrible",
            "It's far from a game. Even if I paid to remove the pointless adds that every game has, this so called game would still be slow and pointless"

Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag. Secondly, there are so many ads that I feel as if I spend more time watching those than playing the game, EVEN WITH IT TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF LAG. This app completely isn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",

Thank You.",

I have 100% the game I beat all the campaigns single and co-op 3 stars maxed out RPG stats for player and weapons and all stages.

Ever heard of it?  If you’re like most people odds are you probably haven’t but you’ve probably heard of its ugly cousin Osteoporosis.  Simply put, Sarcopenia is to the muscle what Osteoporosis is to the bone.  You see, as we age we typically lose about 30% of our muscle and associated strength between ages 45 and 65.  Then the strength losses accelerates. If you don’t do anything to stop it, you will lose up to another 30% of your muscle and strength each decade after 65 years of age.  To put that in perspective, if those same losses occurred with your bones you would literally cease to have a skeletal frame!  \r\n\r\nYou’ve probably never looked at it quite this way, but the reality is that much of the root cause of pain, inactivity, falls and disease in aging is actually Sarcopenia.  The good news is that the same science that has confirmed that it’s occurring in everyone also shows that it is preventable and reversible through specific lifestyle choices.

It is responsible for testes descent and reproductive tract development in the fetus, development of male secondary sex characteristics in puberty, and the production of sperm. Testosterone production in men begins in utero, rises sharply in puberty, and then declines with age (Pic. 2). Indeed, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study showed that total serum testosterone levels decline by 1.6% per year starting at age 40. Testosterone is also produced by the ovaries, the adrenal glands, and tissues such as adipose tissue and skin in women, although serum concentrations are almost 20-fold lower in pre-menopausal women compared to age-matched men. Interestingly, testosterone levels also decline with age in women. This age-dependent reduction in testosterone is not restricted to humans, as it is also seen in older male rats and mice (>20 months of age) in conjunction with a decline in fertility, although whether levels decline in aged female animals has not been investigated.",

        "description": "Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium. The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone mineralization. Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term \"osteomalacia\" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones. In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions necessary for bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides) occurs in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, likely contributing locally to cause matrix hypomineralization (osteomalacia). The most common cause of osteomalacia is a deficiency of vitamin D, which is normally derived from sunlight exposure and, to a lesser extent, from the diet. The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Less common causes of osteomalacia can include hereditary deficiencies of vitamin D or phosphate (which would typically be identified in childhood) or malignancy.",

I couldn't send messages, access websites or even watch videos on YouTube. I tried reconnecting, restarting, but nothing worked. Sadly I will have to uninstall it. I don't know what could be the reason for the app to stop working, but I hope it gets fixed sooner.",
            "It's very good app,its fast, useful, and its very better than other dns changers. I wanted to give 5 stars ,but reason for 4 stars is recently the connection of the app have issues. Its working some time but many times not It's hanging on \"connecting \" , and sometimes connect button not working. I also saw several times my internet connection is ok, and my phone had connect to the network but in app said \" no network \" My wifi is ok and my phone is Android 10 . So please fix this thanks",
            "FIX connecting issues: open Settings, Apps&Notifications, Advanced, SpecialAppAccess, BatteryOptimisation, then change \"Not Optmised\" to \"All Apps\", tap \"1.1.1.1\" in the list, and set it to \"Don't Optimise\". Android stops the connection reopening in the background, its not the app's fault, but this should fix it for you. Note this fix doesn't fully work when Battery Saver is enabled. Also understand Warp only speeds up poor data connections and this fix wont ublock the app in Iran etc.",
            "The trusted network feature doesn't work properly for me. Initially it does, but after a while the VPN gets activated even in my trusted home network. This is a big issue for me, since I have to manually disable it and usually forget to enable it back when I leave home. I am also pretty sure, my custom DoH domain disappeared at least once.",
            "It speeds up my mobile data, but slows my home network. I'm deleting until in can auto connect on mobile data only. It can't discern between my range extender and router, so it often remains on when I want it off. It would be better if it remained off for WIFI and on for mobile data (in my case)."

            "The app have everything I need for tracking my menopause and then some. There are tons of things you can add for each note/day such as moods, hotflases, bleedings, medical stuff, regular calender notes etc. It had some issues in the beginning but that have been fixed and it runs much smoother now. I also got a personal response from the devs when contacting them about issues I felt the app had and a few days later an update arrived, very nice! I highly recommend the app, it's worth every penny.",
            "Has a lot of potential , but does not work well on my tablet. Some of the boxes cannot be filled and it open refuses to save my entries. Frustrating.",
            "..because it does, kind of, do everything that I want it to, especially the reports. But it does it in such clunky, labour-intensive, not-intuitive ways that many times I open it but then get so frustrated with the slowness and very outdated, Windows 2003 style interface... that I just shut it down and don't use it. The intention is good, the elements it aims to capture are good - but the design needs to be scrapped and started again from scratch.",
            "Why adding events at different times of the same day is not easier is strange. Would have been so easy to simply add a new event with automated time stamp! Instead, the time fields move all over the place... very frustrating when one is in the throws of an event.  almost stopped using it!"

        "title": "Alkaline Diet Plan",
        "description": "Alkaline diet (also known as the alkaline ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid alkaline diet) describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can have an effect on the pH balance of the body. It originated from the acid ash hypothesis, which primarily related to osteoporosis research. Most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.\r\n\r\nThese diets have been promoted by alternative medicine practitioners, who propose that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, low energy levels, and other illnesses. Human blood is maintained between pH 7.35 and 7.45 by acid–base homeostasis mechanisms. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkalosis and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious. The idea that these diets can materially affect blood pH for the purpose of treating a range of diseases is not supported by scientific research and makes incorrect assumptions about how alkaline diets function that are contrary to human physiology.\r\n\r\nWhile diets avoiding meat, poultry, cheese, and grains can be used in order to make the urine more alkaline (higher pH), difficulties in effectively predicting the effects of these diets have led to medications, rather than diet modification, as the preferred method of changing urine pH.
