        "title": "Remedies For Osteoarthritis",
        "description": "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative bone disease, which is recognized by the symptoms of painful, inflamed and stiff joints. This is generally thought to be caused by accumulated damage to the connective tissues that the body can no longer efficiently repair, which is why most of the people affected are of more advanced years. While injuries, disease and general wear and tear of the connective tissues are factors that increase the chances of developing osteoarthritis, the exact causes are yet unknown.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, there is no known cure to osteoarthritis, and most treatments instead seek to relieve the symptoms of the disease. This usually allows most people with osteoarthritis the ability to live relatively normal lives, despite having the disease.\r\n\r\nConventional medicine's first approach is to prescribe analgesics to deal with the pain, while anti-inflammatory medication may also be prescribed to deal with any inflammation in the joints. Stiffness and the loss of mobility are treated with physical therapy, and most will also be advised to follow a regimen of moderate exercise to strengthen surrounding muscles. These methods are usually very effective, though more extreme cases may require other steps, such as surgical replacement of the joint.\r\n\r\nAside from conventional methods, alternative natural methods of treatment are also available. These methods include a wide range of disciplines within the classification of alternative medicine, including but not limited to herbal medicine, acupuncture, and the use of natural supplements. In general, conventional medicine does not advocate the use of alternative methods, though some doctors are beginning to accept the use of some alternative methods.\r\n\r\nDespite the lack of support from conventional doctors and medical professionals, alternative natural remedies for osteoarthritis continue to be used, with a growing number of affected individuals admitting to have at least tried out these remedies. In fact, a good number claim to continue to use alternative methods, and testify to the effectiveness of various natural methods.\r\n\r\nWhy do these people choose to use natural remedies to treat their osteoarthritis? Here are some of the most common reasons:\r\n\r\n1. More Practical: In some cases, these natural remedies are considered more practical, as well as economical. Many natural methods advocate the use of remedies that are readily available at home, reducing the expense of treating osteoarthritis. Many of those same methods are also easy to take, or apply, with little need for special instructions or even equipment. In some cases, even using natural supplements for treatment can cost substantially less than prescription drugs.\r\n\r\n2. Safe To Use: Most people who take natural remedies for osteoarthritis perceive these remedies to be safer to use than conventional drugs and medications. Most conventional medications, specially those which are more potent in nature, carry with them risks of harmful side effects, particularly through long-term use. Generally speaking, most alternative natural methods do not have such harmful side effects, or if they do, they are relatively minor when compared to the risks carried by conventional drugs.\r\n\r\n3. Healthier: The growing perception of many people today is that \"natural\" equates to \"healthy\" and that carries over to the remedies and methods used to treat osteoarthritis. While this is not always the case, the fact is that a good number of natural remedies are healthier for the body. Herbal remedies, for example, may also include vitamins and minerals that the body needs, and are also often used to treat more than one condition as well.",

        "description": " Reasons for knee pain \r\n\r\nIf you’re not dealing with a specific injury—say, a torn ACL—sorting out knee pain can seem complicated. The knee is composed of two joints: the tibiofemoral joint, between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), and the patellofemoral joint, between the femur and patella (knee cap). Each is an anchor point for multiple tendons, fascia, and other structures, including the IT band. If you have bad biomechanics, typically caused by a muscle imbalance, especially weak glutes, repetitive movement can irritate structures in the knee and lead to what is broadly known as anterior knee pain—a catchall category for general pain in the front of the knee.  \r\nThe stabilizer muscles for the knee, counterintuitively, are in the hips. When those muscles are weak or imbalanced, they can’t keep your knee properly aligned. “If you’re not able to control the position of your leg as your foot makes contact with the ground, pedal, or rock, it can result in increased stress to the structures of the knee. To further complicate the issue, once the pain signals your brain that there’s a problem, this can lead to further compensations in response to the irritation, which can shut off key muscles and tighten up other structures.\r\n\r\n Explanation of all the muscles that need to be strengthened and why: \r\n\r\n\r\nQuadriceps.\r\n\r\nThey cover the front of the thigh, cross the kneecap and form a tendon known as the patellar tendon. The quadriceps muscles allow you to extend or straiten the knee. If there is a weakness or tightness in the quadriceps you will get pain and stress in the joint as you go upstairs or get up from a chair.\r\n\r\nHip adductor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Adductors allow you to adduct your leg or bring it to the midline of the body. They help to stabilise the hip joint and help maintain the body in a stationary position.\r\n\r\nHip flexor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Flexor muscles allow you to flex your hip. Hip Flexor muscles come from the spine and the pelvis and attach to the upper thigh bone. If the hip flexors are tight or weak they can pull the thigh out of its proper alignment. This in turn pulls the kneecap out of its groove causing knee pain.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles allow you to bend the knee and also extend your hip. Most importantly strong hamstring muscles will help you protect a very important ligament called the ACL.\r\n\r\nGastrocnemius muscle.\r\n\r\nPeople with weak calf muscles often complain of pain in the front of the knee around the patellar tendon area.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius allows you to perform activities including hip abduction and hip external rotation. When you’re walking you’re only on one foot at any given time. The Gluteus medius help you to stabilise your pelvis. If it’s weak you get a drop in your hip and that causes stress on the knee.\r\n\r\nGluteus maximus.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to extend your hip and externally rotate your hip. If the Gluteus maximus muscles are weak other muscles in the back of the leg tend to take over and you end up with overly active hamstrings and tight hamstrings lead to knee pain.",

        "description": "Knee pain is one of the most common orthopedic conditions for which people seek medical treatment. It includes pain felt behind and around the knee cap, especially during activities like stair climbing, squatting, running, and walking while carrying a heavy load. Knee pain can prevent you from participating in your favorite activities and performing daily tasks. Without proper treatment, it can be problematic for years.\r\n\r\nKnee pain can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which include knee stiffness, incorrect positioning of the knee cap at rest or with movement, flat feet, improper exercise form, and weakness of the muscles that control the hip and knee.\r\n\r\nAfter an evaluation, a physical therapist will design an individualized comprehensive treatment program to address the specific factors causing your knee pain. However, there are exercises proven by research that you can do at home to reduce pain and improve your ability to participate in the activities you love!\r\nConsult your health care professional before starting these exercises to determine if they are right for you. If you experience any symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness at any time, you should stop immediately. These exercises are provided for educational information only. If you have concerns or questions about your health, you should consult your health care professional.\r\n\r\n1. Clamshells\r\nLay on your side and support your neck using a pillow or a towel roll. Bend your knees toward your chest, keeping your back straight and your feet aligned with your body. Keep your feet together, lift your top knee toward the ceiling. Keep your hips straight, not allowing yourself to roll forward when you lift your leg. Pause briefly, then slowly lower your knee back down to the start position. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise on each leg, 3 sets once per day. Perform this exercise 2-3 days per week. Optional: Place your back against a wall to keep your body aligned and to prevent from rolling forward.\r\n2. Bridging\r\nLay on your back and bend your knees so your feet are flat. Support your head with a pillow or towel roll. Keep your knees, feet, and hips in line with each other. Lay your arms by your side, keeping them relaxed. Tighten the muscles of your buttocks and lift your hips toward the ceiling. Only raise your hips as high as you can without causing back pain or too much pressure. Pause, then slowly lower your hips down to the start position. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise, 3 sets once per day. Perform this exercise 2-3 days per week.\r\n3. Hip Abduction\r\nLay on your side and bend your bottom knee to give you better balance. Support your head with a pillow or towel roll. Straighten the top knee by tightening the muscles on the top of your thigh. Flex your foot so your toes face forward, lift your leg toward the ceiling, lifting no higher than the line of your body. Pause, then slowly lower your leg back down to the start position. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise on each leg, 3 sets once per day. Perform this exercise 2-3 days per week.\r\n\r\n4. Straight Leg Raise\r\nLay on your back and support your neck with a pillow or neck roll. Bend 1 knee up so your foot is flat and your back is a neutral position (not arched). Keep your arms lying straight and in line with your shoulders. Straighten the other leg by tightening the muscles on the top of your thigh. Keeping your toes pointed up, lift your leg to the height of the bent knee. Pause, then slowly lower your leg back down to the start position. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise on each leg, 3 sets once per day. Perform this exercise 2-3 days per week.\r\n5. Quadruped Hydrant\r\nGet on your hands and knees.

        "description": "Arthritis pain: Arthritis is a group of painful and degenerative conditions marked by inflammation in the joints that causes stiffness and pain. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, gets worse with age and is caused by wear and tear over the years. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints as if they were foreign tissues. Because of this, rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors traditionally treat arthritis with anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers. However, some medications cause side effects, and a natural approach to pain relief is becoming more popular. Remember to consult your doctor before trying these natural remedies.\r\n\r\n1. Lose weight\r\nYour weight can make a big impact on the amount of pain you experience from arthritis. Extra weight puts more pressure on your joints — especially your knees, hips, and feet.\r\n\r\nReducing the stress on your joints by losing weight will improve your mobility, decrease pain, and prevent future damage to your joints.\r\n\r\n2. Get more exercise\r\nThere are more benefits to exercise than just weight loss. Regular movement helps to maintain flexibility in your joints. Weight-bearing exercises such as running and walking can be damaging. Instead, try low-impact exercises such as water aerobics or swimming to flex your joints without adding further stress.\r\n\r\n3. Use hot and cold therapy\r\nSimple hot and cold treatments can make a world of difference when it comes to arthritis pain. Long, warm showers or baths — especially in the morning — help ease stiffness in your joints. Use an electric blanket or moist heating pad at night to keep your joints loose.\r\n\r\nCold treatments are best for relieving joint pain, swelling, and inflammation. Wrap a gel ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel and apply it to painful joints for quick relief.\r\n\r\n4. Try acupuncture\r\nAcupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on your body. This is supposed to reroute energies and restore balance in your body. Acupuncture is the most researched complementary therapy and is recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of over 100 different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that acupuncture has the ability to reduce arthritis pain. If you want to explore this treatment method, be sure to find a licensed and certified acupuncturist in your state.\r\n\r\n5. Use meditation to cope with pain\r\nMeditation and relaxation techniques may be able to help you reduce pain from arthritis by reducing stress and enabling you to cope with it better. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have found that the practice of mindfulness meditation is helpful for some people with painful joints. Researchers also found that those with depression and arthritis benefitted the most from meditation. When stress is reduced, inflammation and thus swelling and pain drop.\r\n\r\nArthritis Guide Main Features: \r\n\r\n✅ arthritis ✅\r\n✅ rheumatoid arthritis ✅\r\n✅ arthritis in hands ✅\r\n✅ arthritis pain relief ✅",

            "I agree with the fiddly setup but I think that the benefits outweigh the hassle. It's been on my phone now since December and I'm keeping on top of my OA. I just keep cycling round the programme. Although I was part of a NHS physiotherapy group, lockdown put paid to that but the app has just carried on working. So I've given it 5 stars because I'm getting around much better and am not taking any painkillers.",
            "This app has really helped me. My knee was dreadful in April/May this year. I'm now walking 5k with no pain.",
            "Password creation: when creating password it helps to have to enter it twice and get them to match! I've asked for a reset email, but none has come. So I can't get in to the app! Very frustrating. Days later: i have uninstalled and reinstalled this app several times, reset the password even more times, and still I cannot get into this app. This is ridiculous!!",
            "I am unable to register. I get a message telling me an error occurred but I am unable to see what this is. I have spent a long time trying to sort this out.",
            "Frustrating, as others have said the date of birth is ridiculous as there is no option other than to scroll back 70+ years to find it. I thought I had overcome this by registering on the website but also keep getting error messages when signing in although user name and password are correct and work on website. Serious flaws with app. Might be good if I could get into it."

        "description": "Have you had an ACL injury or surgery, a Knee Replacement or a Hip Replacement? This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\r\n \r\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work.\r\n \r\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\r\n \r\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app.\r\n \r\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\r\n \r\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\r\n \r\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\r\n \r\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don’t have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\r\n \r\nTotal Hip Replacement - the main purpose of the surgery is to eliminate the pain that people feel from osteoarthritis of the hip joint. The hip surgery was the first and very important step to restoring hip joint movement, reducing hip pain and allowing you to return to your physically active self. However, there is a great deal of rehabilitation and recovery that has to happen after your hip replacement.  If you have had this surgery, Curovate can help you recover. There are daily exercises, important things that you have to do to get better, instructions from your surgeon of what positions to avoid and all of this  information can be very overwhelming and confusing. Curovate simplifies the process of rehabilitation and provides you with daily guidance directly on your phone.",

            "**UPDATE** after receiving response from customer support (which was expedient and right on the money for what I needed). I absolutely LOVE this app!!! (upgrade from 4 stars to 5!!) Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",
            "I started using this app because I know I will need a lengthy history to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I like how easy this app is to use and record my daily symptoms and over all how Im feeling. This app is super helpful.",
            "Love this. Most apps that track your activities etc are very limited without subscribing but this one has a lot of free features and is a great way of keeping track of patterns"

        "title": "HOW TO CURE JOINT PAIN",
        "description": "Joints form the connections between bones. They provide support and help you move. Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nMany different conditions can lead to painful joints, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, gout, strains, sprains, and other injuries. Joint pain is extremely common. In one national survey, about one-third of adults reported having joint pain within the past 30 days. Knee pain was the most common complaint, followed by shoulder and hip pain, but joint pain can affect any part of your body, from your ankles and feet to your shoulders and hands. As you get older, painful joints become increasingly more common.\r\n\r\nJoint pain can range from mildly irritating to debilitating.

Get 10 super easy and effective arthritis pain relief tips from arthritis experts and make your life with arthritis a little easier now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtect your joints. Don’t keep your joints in the same position for a prolonged period of time. Balance your rest and work throughout the day. Use the strongest joints available for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStretch it. Stretching should be part of every arthritis patient’s daily routine. A good stretch helps prevent injuries by warming up muscles and tendons which are more limber and less likely to tear. Spend at least 10 minutes each day stretching, and work each major muscle group. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCool it down. Stop physical activity. Rest in a cool/shaded environment. Spray with a mist of cool water or wrap an ice pack or cold compress in a towel and apply it to reduce arthritis pain and swelling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet moving. Exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness and increases flexibility and muscle strength. It can also help with weight control, stress management, and make you feel better overall. The Arthritis Foundation also offers water exercise and other classes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a massage. Massage therapy can relieve your pain, soothe stiff sore muscles, reduce inflammation and swelling. Make sure you use oil or cream on your fingers to make it mroe gentle. Work the area for five to ten minutes a day if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your weight in balance. Being overweight, even just moderately, impacts weightbearing joints and can increase the pain of arthritis. Studies have indicated that losing extra weight lowers the risk for developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Losing weight can help slow the progression of arthritis too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet a diagnosis. If you are experiencing symptoms like pain, stiffness, swelling for more than 1 weeks, you should consider seeing your doctor and getting a diagnosis. Remember that there are more than 100 types of arthritis. It is important to get the specific diagnosis for the type of arthritis you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake your medication the right way. Don’t stop taking your medication just because you feel it is not working. Check with your doctor first. You need to understand that it may take several days to several months for a medication to become effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook out for new options. Recently FDA has approved some new drugs for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritis diseases. If feel that the current medication doesn’t work well, check with your doctor about possible new options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep educating yourself. It is important to learn something new about arthritis. Find some good websites online and subscribe to their newsletter if they have it. Join one of two active online arthritis communities like forums or bulletin board. Never hesitate to see your doctors and ask questions.",

This article is dedicated to discussing about the natural remedies for joint pain and hence I will stick to the point.\r\n\r\nConventionally arthritis has been managed with analgesics called as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatories (NSAIDs). NSAIDs cause dangerous side effects like gastric ulceration and they also increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. Thus both patients and their doctors are not averse to looking at Mother Nature to help ease the joint pain in arthritis. While natural and herbal remedies are generally free from side effects and are reasonably effective they might interfere with other prescription medications. It is therefore prudent on the part of the patient to check with their doctors first before starting these medications.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole range of natural remedies for joint pain and it would be practically impossible to go through all of them but I will list the ones that are most effective with reasonable scientific backing to their use.\r\n\r\nGlucosamine and Chondroitin: Perhaps no other natural remedy have been as extensively studied as these two. Both Glucosamine and Chondroitin are found naturally occurring in the joints and with wear and tear of the joints these reduce dramatically in an arthritic joint. It is thus appropriate that there should be some relief from joint pains when one substitutes these ingredients in the joint.\r\n\r\nOmega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids have a wide range of beneficial effects in the human body. Derived from fish oils they reduce inflammation and pain of many chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nBromelain: Derived from the Papaya fruit, Bromelain has shown good anti-inflammatory effect and is an analgesic too.\r\n\r\nMethylSulfonylMethane: MSM occurs naturally in plants and animals and preliminary studies have shown promise as a good analgesic in arthritis.\r\nDevil's claw and Cat's claw: Both these herbs have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and have been used for centuries for their effectiveness not only in arthritis but also in other ailments.\r\n\r\nBoswellia (Indian Frankincense): Regular use of Boswellia improves blood flow to the joints thus resulting in a well-nourished and viable joint tissue.

Yes, obviously it's you, unless there's another entry on Google play called injury map which strangely charged my card that I signed up to your app with that I evidently have on my phone... Or I wouldn't be able to post a review, would I? Further it is $79.99 NZ I have been charged. I will happily post pictures.",
            "This is a life changing app that I'd recommend to everyone!

Free access allows you to read the general program description and the 'Tips' section.",

Knee pain can prevent you from participating in your favorite activities and performing daily tasks. Without proper treatment, it can be problematic for years.\r\n\r\nKnee pain can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which include knee stiffness, incorrect positioning of the knee cap at rest or with movement, flat feet, improper exercise form, and weakness of the muscles that control the hip and knee.\r\n\r\nKnee strengthening exercises do not affect the knee joint directly, but they strengthen the muscles surrounding it. Strong muscles in the legs can help provide support for the knees. This support may alleviate pressure and strain on these joints, which can relieve pain and help a person be more active.\r\n\r\nGentle stretching and strengthening exercises can strengthen the muscles that support your knee joint. Having stronger muscles can reduce the impact and stress on your knee, and help your knee joint move more easily.\r\n\r\nWhy exercise is vital?\r\n\r\nExercise can help you improve your health and fitness without hurting your joints.

            "Had to uninstall. I could never get it to tell me less than 5 days per week. I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",
            "I was so excited about this app. I finally could do exercises for my specific issues. However the plan never works. My screen goes black right after the welcome video. I'm so disappointed.",

There is also training for post graduates specialising in general medicine in the form of registrar rotations through Rheumatology, as well as formal teaching for the Part 1 and Part 2 of the FCP (SA) examinations. Medical registrars rotating through the unit are encouraged to undertake rheumatology topics for the MPhil degree. The Division is highly suited for training super specialists in Rheumatology due to the wide spectrum of rheumatic diseases that are treated in the different clinics.\r\n\r\nService is provided through several outpatient clinics and inpatients admitted to the general medical wards as well as the orthopaedic wards. Patients with severe RA may be admitted for surgery or for rehabilitation purposes. There are 2 new patient clinics per week and 2 follow-up clinics per week. In addition, a weekly Connective Tissue Diseases clinic has been established for treating patients with SLE, Scleroderma, Myositis and different forms of vasculitis, especially Takayasu’s Disease.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Rheumatology has several research interests relating to different aspects of the rheumatic diseases. Osteoporosis is an area of interest for many years and there is ongoing collection of longitudinal bone mineral density data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Age-related bone loss at different skeletal sites is being prospectively studied in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Endocrine Unit. Clinical drug trials are in progress to study the safety and efficacy of the newer non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), in collaboration with the GIT Unit. These newer COXIBS are being evaluated in patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). All of these include collaborative participation with the GIT Unit, where gastropathy is an outcome variable, measured by gastroscopy. Recently, the trials of coxibs have included cardiovascular outcomes as well. We have also been looking at SLE genetics in collaboration with the Hepatology Unit at UCT. Newer areas of research include the study of chronic tophaceous GOUT; community aspects of diagnosing and treating rheumatic diseases at CHC’s; early rheumatoid arthritis; genetics of bone loss in SLE; and functional problems in ankylosing spondylitis and DMARDs in Psoriatic Arthritis. More recently, we have been involved in studies looking at the short-term and long-term effects of biologic therapiesin the different rheumatic diseases, especially RA.\r\n\r\nThe rheumatic diseases unit provides in- and outpatient rheumatology services for the entire Western Cape region. Sessions are carried out at the Heideveld and Khayelitsha Community Health Centres 6 times a year. Training is provided on a continuous basis for medical students, allied health professionals, a senior house officer, two rotating medical registrars and two career registrars. Research is largely clinically orientated, but a laboratory-based approach is being used to study the genetics of SLE and the differentiation between flares and infection in SLE patients. Family studies have also been started in patients with SLE and RA. In addition, there is very significant involvement in clinical drug trials in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.

Several conditions are covered, like rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, microcrystalline arthritis (gout), lupus (SLE), osteoarthritis, etc. The benefits for the patients are numerous: reduce the frequency of visits to the rheumatologist (in agreement with the rheumatologist), detect earlier the failure/inefficacy of an ongoing treatment, and thus earlier adpatation of the therapeutic strategy. This adds up naturally to the fact that the user has an objective idea of his/her status with respect to a rheumatic condition and its evolution over time, which in itself is a benefit. The app thus really allows to follow the \"treat-to-target\" trend. This mobile application can be connected to RheumaKit.com, a web platform for personalized medicine in Rheumatology to be used by the clinicians. Each clinician can store a much larger collection of information of interest regarding each patient. The types of information that can be managed by the clinicians are related to treatment, to diagnosis or to disease activity and can include biological and even genomic testing. Currently, the mobile application allows the follow-up of the user via three self-reported metrics: the simplified Health Assessment Questionaire (HAQ-DI), the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).

        "description": "What Are the Causes of Low Back Pain?\r\nStrains\r\n\r\nThe muscles and ligaments in the back can stretch or tear due to excess activity. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the lower back, as well as muscle spasms. Rest and physical therapy are remedies for these symptoms.\r\nDisc Injury\r\n\r\nThe discs in the back are prone to injury, and this risk increases with age. The outside of the disc can tear or herniate. A herniated disc (also known as a slipped or ruptured disc) occurs when the cartilage surrounding the disc pushes against the spinal cord or nerve roots. The cushion that sits between the spinal vertebrae extends outside its normal position. This can result in compression of the nerve root as it exits from the spinal cord and through the vertebral bones. Disc injury usually occurs suddenly after lifting something or twisting the back. Unlike a back strain, pain from a disc injury usually lasts for more than 72 hours.\r\nSciatica\r\n\r\nSciatica can occur with a herniated disc if the disc presses on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spine to the legs. As a result, sciatica can cause pain in the legs and feet. This pain usually feels like burning or pins and needles.\r\nSpinal Stenosis\r\n\r\nSpinal stenosis is when the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Spinal stenosis is most commonly due to degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae. The result is compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or soft tissues, such as discs. Pressure on the spinal nerves causes symptoms such as numbness, cramping, and weakness. You might feel these symptoms anywhere in the body. Many people with spinal stenosis notice their symptoms worsen when standing or walking.\r\nAbnormal Spine Curvatures\r\n\r\nScoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis are all conditions that cause abnormal curvatures in the spine. These are congenital conditions and are usually first diagnosed when patients are children and teenagers. The abnormal curvature places pressure on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and vertebrae, causing pain and poor posture.\r\nOther Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other conditions that cause lower back pain. These conditions include arthritis, fibromyalgia (long-term pain and tenderness in the joints, muscles, and tendons), spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spinal bones), and spondylosis (a degenerative disorder that may cause loss of normal spinal structure and function). Although aging is the primary cause of spondylosis, the location and rate of degeneration is individual.\r\n\r\nKidney and bladder problems, pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and cancer can also cause low back pain.\r\n\r\nread more just download our app now \r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain app :\r\n\r\n- symptoms\r\n- signs\r\n- Risk and Prevention\r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- symptom \r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰\r\n✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰",

        "description": "Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the connective tissue which supports the arch of the foot. It results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot that is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin. The pain typically comes on gradually, and it affects both feet in about one third of cases. \r\nThe causes of plantar fasciitis are not entirely clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot, a tight Achilles tendon, and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear if they have a role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. Since inflammation plays either a lesser or no role, a review proposed it be renamed plantar fasciosis The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms; ultrasound is sometimes useful. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Heel Pain symptoms, Heel Pain Management & Heel Pain causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Heel Pain Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Check out these  great exercises to strengthen your knees so you can enjoy your day-to-day activities with less pain, popping and stopping.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to develop stronger knees and ward off future injuries is to build strong, fluid and solid muscles around the knees and in your legs and core.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating precise knee stretches and targeted exercise for knee pain into your routine, you can revamp and enhance the strength of those achy knees that have been bothering you for years.\r\nSit on a table or desk with your legs hanging freely, and place a thin pad under your knee, so that the knee is slightly higher than the hip. Extend the knee slowly with the foot flexed, until the leg is extended; hold 3-5 seconds, and then lower slowly under control. Do 10 repetitions and repeat with the other leg. You can do 2-3 sets as needed.\r\nAs you get stronger, you can add light ankle weights to increase the resistance. Your kneecaps will love you for this one! Your hamstring muscles will also get an excellent stretch in the process, as you strengthen your quads.\r\nStand on a 2 inch board or small step. Keeping your thigh in a straight line with the upper body, bend your knee to a 90 degree angle and slowly lower down. Keep your foot flexed throughout the movement. You can keep your thigh pressed against a table, to ensure that it stays in line with your trunk.\r\nDo 10 repetitions, and repeat with the other leg. You can do 2-3 sets as needed.\r\n\r\nAs you get stronger, you can add light ankle weights to increase the resistance. In this exercise, your hamstring muscles get stronger, while you stretch out your quads.\r\nStand with your head, back and hips against a wall, your feet about hip-width apart. Slowly bend your knees, and glide down the wall until just before you reach a sitting position. Hold the position for five to ten seconds and then slowly come up. Repeat 5-10 times as needed.\r\nYou should keep your abdominal muscles engaged and not allow your pelvis to slide down lower than your knees. Avoid bringing the knees forward over the toes.\r\n\r\nThis quadriceps exercise will strengthen your knee joint and build stamina along the entire leg.\r\nBy strengthening the muscles around your knee, you’ll be able to relieve the regular strain placed on the knee joint. With less stress on the knee, you’ll be able to boost your chances to relieve pain and avoid further injury.\r\n\r\nAs with all things, action is the key. It’s crucial to make time in our busy schedules to devote to improving our joints and bodies. Investing just fifteen minutes a day can provide a great payoff for your quality of life down the road.\r\n\r\nA final note: the term ‘no pain, no gain’ is outdated and obsolete. You should never experience sharp or shooting pain when engaging in the above exercises. If you do, modify your position or consult your doctor or a physical therapist.\r\n\r\nStrength and flexibility go hand-in-hand: a fluid muscle is a happy muscle. Knee exercises and stretches that promote both power and flexibility are of the greatest benefit. Knee strengthening exercises develop the muscles around the knee, but they can also cause the muscles to get tight, if not stretched properly. A tight muscle will constrict the knee joint and be more prone to injury. Stretching after knee strengthening exercise will alleviate muscle soreness and keep the muscles long and elastic.",

        "description": "With the passing of time, we do not realize the amount of stress our bodies goes through. We tend to ignore the wear our body withstands. The knee, especially, on which the body weight stands, and which aids us in movements for our day-to-day actions, is one of the essential areas of your body that is impacted. Due to its nature this body joint tends to go through some form of suffering if not taken care of. There are several home remedies that can help you end the pain and discomfort of chronic knee pain.\r\n\r\nElderly people face a lot of problems like arthritis, among other things, that result in suffering. If the knee joint problem is not taken care of over a time period, it can cause huge and intense suffering. However, immediate attention and regular knee pain remedies can reduce this issue.\r\n\r\nToday, there are many herbal solutions prescribed by medical experts but one should refer to a doctor to know which one suits them best. One of the best known home remedy solutions is known as PRICE. PRICE stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Pressure and Level. This is one of the widely accepted home solutions that is followed to end suffering.\r\n\r\nUsing products that contain relaxing essential oils can lessen the suffering due to injury or inflammation. Avoid using excess cream that may cause discomfort due to high temperatures that may burn the skin. Do exercises for your painful joints that target muscle mass around the knee and help in building up the muscle mass. While doing stretches be sure to go slow and do not over stretch as it may split a muscle. Proper and consistent use of the muscle mass that maintains the knee with exercise routines is the most vital thing to do to look after your legs from harm or injury. Weak and worn out muscle masses can't sustain the knee joint or act as a shock-absorber for the knee.\r\n\r\nWhen you experience a cramp, stretch the impacted muscle with one palm while you massage the center of the knee using your alternate palm. Then you should walk it out. Once an acute cramp is realized, steer clear of doing heavy routines right away. As an alternative, take a stroll for a few minutes to maintain the blood circulation back to the legs. You can also make a substance using castor, turmeric extract mixed in resolved butter or wheat. This paste can then be applied to the joint.\r\n\r\nBeing overweight is also one of the major reasons for knee joint pain and hence losing those excess pounds can help you to get rid of the chronic suffering. Try running, walking, or swimming, or whatever you are comfortable with and stay fit to steer clear of pain. During the winter, keep your knee heated and warm by using a wintergreen treatment as it produces a high temperature and reduces pain. If it's not adequate, then wrap your legs with heated clothes after applying the treatment.\r\n\r\nAlways consult experts before opting for any home remedies for knee pain as your knees are a significant part of your body and helps with body movements and other essential actions.",

The prevalence of knee pain has increased over the past 20 years, with osteoarthritis being the most common cause in individuals over the age of 50. Knee pain that is caused by injury is most often associated with knee cartilage tears. Knee injuries can occur as the result of a direct blow or sudden movement that strains the knee beyond its normal range of movement. Knee pain can cause difficulty performing activities such as walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, or playing sports. Physical therapists are specially trained to help diagnose and treat knee pain, and help individuals return to their normal activities without pain or limitation.",

In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",
            "This app used 5 gb of my data from the background. I haven't even opened the app over a month but it's running in the background for some reason and takes up a lot of your data.",
            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",
            "Yelp has gotten worse then GOOGLE search when it comes to searching for the nearest business you search for. Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

For centuries, the Chinese have healed and strengthened their bodies with Qigong (chee-kung), the art of using the mind to direct the energy within your body to improve health and vitality.

When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians.

            "I love this game so much ❤❤but it really needs some upgrades like eggs and cakes and many more desserts and you should also give more utensils and dishes and a sink too like a REAL KITCHEN! !! That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",
            "It's so good I like it but the costumers is so ugly.",
            "Game keeps crashing after i play it for 1 minute",
            "It's a good game. Fun to play, interesting. Only problem is that more ingredients can be included, more cooking methods, and easier stuff. Especially issue is characters. I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Best game I ever played it is not lagging you dont need ads to buy and equip anything and it is so easy I love it so much no words can describe how much I love this game",
            "This is the worst game ive ever played. I dont recommend this game to anyone. This took me 4 hours to download litteraly 1 percent every 2 minutes, then i get the worst possible experience of my life. Also, ads every single level and usually i instantly die because theres 6 wheel spikes at the very beginning not timed right to be possible. I dont care what you do to this game, im never playing it again.",

            "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, and Sonic as a whole. But this \"free\" version is unacceptable. Far too many ads. This replaced the version I paid for years ago, which doesn't make any difference because the restore purchase button takes me straight to Sonic 2. Can't even find the paid version. Game 5/5, port 0/5 until restore function is fixed (this has been an issue for well over a year)",
            "It's a fantastic adaptation of the game and I would give it 5 stars if not for: - Scrap Brain zone act 2 is broken and loops back to the start of the level -- is this by design? It doesn't allow me to finish the game! - Even though I purchased the game I keep getting one add every time I open the app - I need to be online to play the game - come on man this would be amazing during long plane trips!",
            "I LOVE SONIC but this port aint the best i would rather play and emulated version and when ever i try to use debug it pauses the game i mean come on sega what the hell if this was fixed it would get a big five stars but still i love this game and i hope this bug is fixed PLEASE SEGA FIX THIS!!!!!",

Only problem is that achievements are a bit iffy; it says I got the chaos consiour achievement even though I only have three chaos emeralds. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",
            "Not exactly a good experience. Saw three ads from the time I opened the game to the time I made a save & an additional two once I selected start. After the two ads, totalling over a minute, the game crashes, & process repeats. I could see enough ads I'd see from playing Sonic Forces for a week in just half an hour of trying to load a game. The controls are also really funky, making the game over twice as hard as it should. I'm disappointed, I expected better from one of my favorite franchises :/"

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time.

That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",

I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",

I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it.

            "Great ,checkers, game. Best one I've ever installed on my Tablet. Just the adds, are to, long. 😞 ,Other then that it's really a great game, and the Graphics are so real, seems like you're really playing the game.👍, THANKS for very enjoyable ,game to play on my tablet. 🎮 👍🙋🎮 Love, the surprise!! 🎁🎁🎁🎉🎉 I strongly recommend this game to anyone that likes Checker's.",
            "I like this game - it's a good way to pass the time. But, when you have a chance to take a player, it makes you do that move (it doesn't give you the option to do any other move), even if it means you will get taken! If this was fixed it would be five stars. Edit: Thank your for your reply! I had no idea you could do that in the settings :)",
            "This is a fantastic game with a properly applied rules. You cannot beat backwards and kings can move only 1 adjacent square. There are no intrussive ads what today makes a huge difference among other so called games where the main point is to show as many ads as possible. 5 stars. Great!",
            "I tried this game. It is not that fun. It kind of made me mad.A lot of the times it makes you move checker and then I get jumped! It actually makes you lose by making you move certain checkers. For instance it makes you jump the other team and then the other team jumps two of you!😡 It has different levels easy, hard, and expert. I played expert and it was easy. Well for me. I do not know if i am just really good or what. I recommend not to play if you are even some what good.Get Roblox instead",
            "I sink far more time into this than I care to admit. Very polished draughts game which supports multiple rule sets despite what others have said (check the settings) I think the only thing missing that would make this perfect would be online play, but playing against the computer always provides a reasonable challenge"

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "It's a great app but every time I'm reading things if I scroll down it scrolls back up and I have to keep scrolling down just to read a little bit more then it scrolls back up it's really annoying to the point I don't even like to read comments anymore 😑",
            "It was one of the the best app among the others few years back. Used it for my pregnancy 3 years ago. Now for my second pregnancy downloaded it and all could see is unwanted upgrading ads ,every article i open requires a premium upgrade. Looks like all it cares about is how to make money.its super super annoying. Uninstalling it.",
            "Kinda hard to navigate and constantly pulling up the premium ads. Deleted it ultimately because every time i tried to read about my week; i was confounded by stories of miscarriage that triggered my anxiety over previous loss and got me scared and worried. I started not using it and then deleted over that.",
            "I love this app, and truly feel that the premium option is worth it. Many people are quick to dismiss paid for apps, but they forget the team behind the platform, which lead me through when I didn't want to conceive, to now - half way through my pregnancy. I get excited to check my daily update on my pregnancy journey: supported by great articles relating to every single day of pregnancy, and a community to chat with, along with smart analysis. Thanks Glow, keep up the great work!",
            "This is a pretty good app for being free besides all the ads to upgrade. I can log things I do like water intake, if I take my prenatal, how much sleep I get, etc. It also gives updates about my baby and what stage he/she is in and each week compares its size to food 😄 I like that there are articles I can read and there are other people in the same stage at me on this so it's like we're all in this together ❤"

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

        "comments": [
            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home. You might even encounter the tiger king on your adventure (a superior evolution of the natural tiger), who has been spotted in the forest for the first time in centuries!  \r\n\r\nGROUNDBREAKING 3D GRAPHICS\r\n\r\nExperience never before seen 3D graphics quality in a wildlife simulation MMO, with dynamic lighting and time of day cycles which bring the virtual world to life!

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2, with the range 25–30 kg/m2 defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and depression. \r\nObesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Obesity Guide, Obesity Disease Management & Obesity Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Obesity Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",

In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",

I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",

Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",
            "Why is it that I always get a 2 star superstar out of a premium I dont understand this concept is this luck or It is decided before itself that a 3 or a 4 star is not available in a premium otherwise this game is good! Keep it up!"

If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

Home Exercise Program\r\nExercise programs are an important component of any sciatica treatment plan. By stretching and strengthening parts of your body that may be causing irritation of the sciatic nerve, you can reduce pain and speed up recovery.\r\nThe most effective exercises depend on the underlying reason you are suffering from sciatica. Sciatica caused by a herniated disc, for example, is not treated with the same exercises as sciatica caused by spinal stenosis. To find out the best exercises for any cause of sciatica, click here.\r\n\r\n2. Balance Your Diet\r\nCuring sciatica permanently often means treating more than just the physical cause. You also need to improve your diet to prevent the pain from reoccurring.\r\nOne of the easiest ways to reduce the pain associated with sciatica is to drink more water. When you’re dehydrated, parts of the spine become deflated. This can cause extra pressure on the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n3.  Home Remedies\r\nHome remedies can make a big difference to your sciatica pain – and often relatively quickly. The great thing about home remedies is that they don’t require a prescription or expensive ingredients.",

            "So I loved this game and I paid for no ads, and got all the monsters. But yet I guess now that I'm towards the \"end\" I have to watch an ad to play. No problem but 1. I paid for no ads. None. And I can't watch the ad to play your game. It keeps saying there's no video available, try again later and freezes. So over all. Love the actual game and game play, but don't waste your money and be fully prepared to not be able to move forward in the game. I got to 77, I passed. I can't play the other 3.",
            "My daughter loved this game but since she got to level 61, she can't revive. If she does, the character moves but the screen doesn't move with her. She also is having a problem with the repair alphabet rooms. She's on room F, has done everything, but it won't reward her or unlock the next room. Gutting for a 6 year old. I think she's finished the game, she's just replaying some levels now.",
            "I love this game, but as soon as I tried to paint on room 2 everything froze, I tried turning my phone on and off, closing the game... nothing worked! It might of been a virus but I'm not sure, I loved this game so much and ended up having to uninstall it then reinstall. I have had to start ALL OVER AGAIN 😠😠😠 That is why I have to give it a three out of five, sorry! It is a really fun game though.",
            "I originally had this game on an Amazon tablet where the ads are contained. After upgrading my son's tablet to a more powerful android device I re-download this. This game is flooded with microtranaction and ads even after paying the 2 dollars to \"remove ads\". What this $2 doesn't include is the need to watch 30s ads for each level after level 16 everytime you play a lvl. This is false advertisement and dishonesty around paying $2 to \"remove ads\". DO NOT download for your kids. I want my $2 back",
            "I give this game a 1 out five because everytime I try to play the game it kicks me out I haven't evan got to see if the game was nice cause it kicks me out . I don't recommend this game for anyone, it just takes up space that you can use for another app that actually works!!.very bad quality, very bad game!!!!!!!!!"

        "description": "There are a few natural remedies for shoulder pain you can do from the comfort of your own home, but before we get into the \"natural remedies for...\" let me just take a brief moment to explain why you may have picked up this problem so it can be avoided in future cases down the road.\r\n\r\nShoulder pain most often comes from overuse of muscle tendons either by gardening, playing tennis...well, you get the picture. I picked up my shoulder injury by carrying the world on it for too long. I actually picked up my injury from excessive over use. I am a plasterer by trade (used to be) and the constant movement and rotation of my arm in a circular motion weakened the tendons over time.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I had to do was go see a doctor and in my case this was a complete waste of time. I mean, what in god's name is a doctor going to do for my shoulder I ask you...nothing but prescribe some pain killers, and I bloody hate prescription drugs. This is why I set out to get the injury fixed without the need for pill popping and you can too. Natural remedies for shoulder pain was the best option for me, but I must stress, it may not be for you. It all depends on the severity of the condition.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a few things I did to get my shoulder back to its peak performance. Just remember, if the problem persists and you feel the injury is very serious, you should go to a physiotherapist to get it looked at by a professional. If you have little or no money like me then you can try the steps below:\r\n\r\nStretching:\r\n\r\nThe single best solution to start with is to stretch those muscles and joints throughout the day. This has done wonders for my shoulder and I continue to use stretch exercises every day, 5 years on. I haven't had any muscle or joint worries since then so I recommend you buy a good book that teaches the basics of stretching and do those exercises every day from now on.\r\n\r\nHeat:\r\n\r\nIf you are having shoulder trouble (which of course you are) make sure to get a heat pad and place on your shoulder throughout the day. As natural remedies for shoulder pain goes, heat is a great way to determine how serious the injury really is. The heat relaxes your muscles and this alone could be enough to get your joints back to basics. Soaking in a hot bath once in a while can be great to ease any discomfort also. What I'm saying here is that heat is a great indicator to how serious the problem really is.",

Other than that the game will go to 5 star if fixed... please",

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

        "description": "Our app helps both clinicians and researchers. Through the app, physical therapists are able to monitor how a patient’s relative level of physical disability differs throughout the course of rehabilitation. Additionally, researchers trying to improve physical function in individuals with knee osteoarthritis can use OAFunction as a tool for eligibility criteria for clinical trials. Currently, research subjects may be selected into a clinical trial based on a physical function cutoff that is the same for everyone. However, OAFunction can be used to set a threshold based on a patient-specific level of physical function and allow researchers to only include patients with a specific amount of disability, which may improve the outcomes of clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThe simple and intuitive layout allows users to easily enter important patient characteristics and performance results of common clinically-accessible physical function tests. Available patient characteristics currently include: sex, age, knee osteoarthritis severity (i.e., Kellgren-Lawrence Grade), and body mass index. Current physical function tests include: 20 meter walk speed, chair stand speed, and 400 meter walk time.\r\n \r\nAfter entering the patient characteristics and physical function test performance, OAFunction automatically determines a patient’s relative level of physical function based on reference values from a large study of individuals with and at risk for knee osteoarthritis (i.e., The Osteoarthritis Initiative). A patient’s relative level of physical function will range from minimum to maximum in 10% increments. For example, a relative level of physical function of 70-80% on 20 meter walk speed indicates that this individual walks at a pace that is faster than 70% of individuals with similar patient characteristics.\r\n \r\nOAFunction allows for healthcare professionals to select from two to up to all four participant characteristics to be taken into consideration when determining an individual’s patient-specific level of disability. For example, a researcher could select “age” and “sex” if they were interested in how a subject compared to individuals with the same sex and within a 5-year age range. Additionally, if a clinician wanted a more nuanced view of a patient’s disability, they could select all patient characteristics to determine an individual’s level of disability compared to a group of individuals with similar sex, age, severity of knee osteoarthritis, and body mass index. The intuitive slider display that indicates relative level of disability allows the health care professional to select or deselect any combination of patient characteristics, which can be used to see how the patient-specific level of disability differs depending based on various combinations of patient characteristics.",

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

        "description": "Problems with the spine such as osteoporosis can lead to back pain.\r\nThe human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.<br>Abnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.<br>Osteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.<br>Kidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.<br>Movement and posture<br>Back pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.<br><br>Examples include:<br><br>twisting<br>coughing or sneezing<br>muscle tension<br>over-stretching<br>bending awkwardly or for long periods<br>pushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something<br>standing or sitting for long periods<br>straining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer<br>long driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched<br>sleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight<br>Other causes<br>Some medical conditions can lead to back pain.<br><br>Cauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.<br>Cancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.<br>Infection of the spine: A fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.<br>Other infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.<br>Sleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.<br>Shingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

            "This is a very well designed app. It's clean, uncluttered, & easy to use. I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"
