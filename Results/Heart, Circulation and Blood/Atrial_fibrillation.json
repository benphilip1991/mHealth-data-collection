Gave it 2 stars because I like the idea of the app, but the heart rate was consistently 10-20 bpm above my Garmin heart rate monitor (which is trusted) and the actual pulse in my wrist - way off. The app consistently told me I have an arrhythmia, but said the same for everyone who tried it - including my red sofa cushion which is apparently also bradycardic lol. I'm sure I was on the camera lens well, and remained very still. If you download this app, don't take it too seriously.",

It is extremely simple to use, very accurate and records and stores results, giving me something very meaningful to show my cardiologist. One addition I'd like to see is a small text field to allow a recording to be annotated with activity information to add important context.",
            "This app has picked up on irregularities well. And is accurate in detecting rate. But I really wish there was a way to make a note to say what was going on when I used it at that particular time. Something other than \"resting\", \"warm up\" etc. Sometimes I get palpitations and will check my rate. Would be nice to be able to add a note like \"palpitations while cooking dinner\". Then I can fill my doctor in when I see him next.",
            "Best! Ive used many... I suffer from mental and physical health issues. When my anxiety shoots up, I have to do breathing exercises, and I have to monitor my heart rate. So I know what, and when things are happ. This app really is incredible that works immidiate, and you can print/Share out your own cardiograph!!! That is huge for me I mean huge! You can go back to different dates, whatever you want to do if you're looking for something to monitor your heart rate I absolutely recommend this!",

            "Additional Edit: Once again they have \"improved\" this app by making it impossible to save the results with one step. Formerly, you could just hit EMAIL and direct it to (in my case) a DropBox folder. Now you have to download the PDF and from your PDF viewer save it to (again in my case) DropBox. At least they removed the annoying Asian Font and the files are back to a manageable size, again. Thanks for that, at least, AliveCor. EDIT: Unnecessary addition of Asian Fonts to all PDFs problem solved, for the most part. If you Save As Optimized PDF, you can reduce a 1 lead file from 2500 KB to about 280 KB. It isn't as good as it used to be at 60 KB, but it is still a vast improvement over what we have been struggling with. A better option would be to allow us to opt out of this \"feature\", but that isn't happening soon. I own and use the 6L version of the device. This device and app take a pretty good EKG when used correctly. For me, I need to have some electrode gel on the pads to get a clear reading, but I have some fairly substantial calluses on my fingers, so I don't hold that against the device. Although it only claims to detect atrial fibrillation, it also correctly detected tachycardia the one time I checked what seemed like a fast heartbeat. Taking an EKG during an episode is very desirable to have your doctor know exactly what is going on. It was easy to set up and sending the results to a folder in DropBox is a snap. Sending the EKG directly to my doctor was not an option due to the Hippa (?) laws, but I was able to send a link to the folder on DropBox that they could access quite easily, along with an entire slew of previous readings for reference. I hope that they are working on getting clearance to detect other things as they become proven to be effective. So far, only the first line of the 6 line EKG seems to be used by the device, but the other 5 lines are there and must have some info, too. I would recommend this app and device for the peace of mind alone, if you have unusual feelings from your heart. Additional info from July, 2020: After using this device for over half a year, I still like it. It is fairly easy to use, but sometimes I need to add gel to get a good reading. There are a couple of things I'd like to see added to the software. When I have an unusual reading, I'd like to be able to have that included in the file name, if possible. Perhaps have it end with a \"T\" for tachycardia or \"U\" for unclassified. Also, as mentioned above, sometimes I have to use electrode gel and sometimes I don't. If it were possible to set up 3 or 4 custom, but ready-to-go notes to add to the comments without having to use the phone's keypad (hard for us older folks), that would also be nice. I'd do something like gel or no gel, personally. Still love the app, though.",
            "Didn't even bother to start. Will return rightaway. Another datamining app that requires you to consent to their \"privacy policy\" and \"other policies\" as well as that they can bombard you with marketing for which to give you an option that can opt out later... I just wonder, once they have all your data what they do with your cardiograms they log and how is this HIPAA protected? I'm out! Find another idiot!",
            "Device is good. App does its job but in a really awkward way (latest version is even worse). So many clicks to do the basic action of record/view/add notes. Also it is constantly nagging me to subscribe. I don't want to or need to (and have paid for the device) - nagging like this makes the experience worse than it should/could be.",
            "As a young 22 year old with several heart disease conditions i chose this app and device which my specialist told me about within the first 2 week's of using the device it saved my life . Paramedics EKG couldn't show anything at the time. I did the device 10 mins prior to them showing up and them and doctors could treat me and still continuing to treat me from the ekg's that where recorded via the kardia 6L device",
            "App won't load from Playstore. Doesn't complete download and install. NOTE 10+ . Lots of available memory and storage. Changing review. After doing a reset of apps on the Note 10+, install completed. Application worked wonderful. Appears to have been a local issue with my phone."

However, the PAI function doesn't work, and it pauses during work out on its own so for a one hour exercise you might have 3-4 intervals for no reason. Also, in order to track your own activity , are we using this app or Accuro. You guys should settle on one",

            "App shows exact measure data but it has no correction algorithms to calculate Hart rate. I got Hart rate mostly above 150bpm. It's twice as much as the true value. I switched to Samsung Health app which calculates my Hart rate correctly. By my opinion this app is useful for nerds and data analysts but not for regular users. This app has no annoying ads.",
            "This is not supported by rog phone 2. I will say that from looking at it, this app looks superb and would most likely rate five stars if I did work. The reason why is because my phone does not use Samsung hardware or software. What stinks is this app looks like it's exactly what I want. I also want to thank the developers for using either no ads or no intrusive ads.",
            "Phenomenal app. Thanks a lot to the developer for his hard work. Really detailed and polished. Uses the heart rate sensor and spo2 sensor of your phone to give detailed results about your vitals. No ads no permission except for the actual sensor in use. Bless you sir (note* app gives easy to understand outcomes in results page and uses the actual sensor than can be found in many phones-not the camera lens** i think the very latest samsung phones don't have that..so please check first.)",
            "This app brings more than I could think of as I was looking for a heart rate app that uses a Samsung Galaxy heart rate monitor instead of a camera. I also wanted to save the output, since that's impossible in the Samsung Health app. This app shows a lot more data than just the heart rate. I'm considering to get my doctor's degree to understand it all. Anyway, great app and I would be happy to contribute in some way!",
            "Wow. So much information. Make sure if your phone has a light next to camera... Use that. Not the camera to read the info. I made this mistake. It kept making me nervous because it would say that there was issues with my heart. As soon as I used the little square next to the camera everything went to normal. So after much research you're supposed to use that little square next to the camera to put your finger on. But the results are amazing. If you want more information press the top right button and click all options."

Luego al hacer click en el icono de warfarina, esta lo envía a determinar un score de riesgo SAMeTT2R2 score que evalúa la probabilidad de que el paciente tenga mayor chance de alcanzar el mayor tiempo en rango terapéutico (TRT) así: Si el paciente tiene un score del SAMeTT2R2 score < 2, esto sugiere que el paciente tendrá una mayor probabilidad de alcanzar un tiempo en rango terapéutico (TRT) > 65%; pero si el valor del SAMeTT2R2 score es > 2 estos pacientes tendrían menor probabilidad de alcanzarlo, y por lo tanto se recomendaría un manejo más intensivo o en una clínica de anticoagulación con vigilancia y seguimiento más estrecho.  Luego de calculado SAMeTT2R2, el cual se encuentra dentro de la aplicación, el algoritmo lo llevara a la recomendación del INR adecuado para el paciente con FA. (INR entre 2.0 y 3.0). \r\n\r\nSi el paciente tiene FA no valvular, el click en ese icono, lo dirigirá a evaluar el CHA2DS2-VASc que indicará que paciente no requiere ningún tipo de anticoagulación ni anti-agregación (CHA2DS2-VASc = 0). También el score nos informara el riego anual de ACV (Ataque cerebrovascular isquémico cardioembolico). La indicación y la evidencia del uso de este score viene incluido en la app. Posterior a esta calculo la app lo dirigirá a la evaluación de riesgo de sangrado con el HAS-BLED (También incorporado en la app), y el resultado se presentaría como bajo riesgo o alto riesgo de sangrado así: Si el HAS-BLED es > 3 alto riesgo de sangrado que no contraindica la anticoagulación y solo para modificar los factores de riesgo identificados. En la app también hay lista adicional de factores de riesgo de sangrado usados en otros scores de riesgo. \r\n\r\nLuego del HAS-BLED, la app lo lleva al valor del CHA2DS2-VASc que cálculo y hará la recomendación de anticoagulación o no. Para hombres anticoagulación oral si CHA2DS2-VASc > 1 y para mujeres si CHA2DS2-VASc > 2. Definida la indicación de anticoagulación la app lo dirige para que calcule la depuración de creatinina por la fórmula de Cockcroft-Gault (También se encuentra dentro de la app). Junto con las evidencias que soportan esta indicación. Si el cálculo de depuración de creatinina es: > 30 mL/min, la app lo llevara a considera el uso de anticoagulantes orales directos (ACOD)[Apixaban, dabigatran o Rivaroxaban].

Luego al hacer click en el icono de warfarina, esta lo envía a determinar un score de riesgo SAMeTT2R2 score que evalúa la probabilidad de que el paciente tenga mayor chance de alcanzar el mayor tiempo en rango terapéutico (TRT) así: Si el paciente tiene un score del SAMeTT2R2 score &lt; 2, esto sugiere que el paciente tendrá una mayor probabilidad de alcanzar un tiempo en rango terapéutico (TRT) &gt; 65%; pero si el valor del SAMeTT2R2 score es &gt; 2 estos pacientes tendrían menor probabilidad de alcanzarlo, y por lo tanto se recomendaría un manejo más intensivo o en una clínica de anticoagulación con vigilancia y seguimiento más estrecho.  Luego de calculado SAMeTT2R2, el cual se encuentra dentro de la aplicación, el algoritmo lo llevara a la recomendación del INR adecuado para el paciente con FA. (INR entre 2.0 y 3.0). <br><br>Si el paciente tiene FA no valvular, el click en ese icono, lo dirigirá a evaluar el CHA2DS2-VASc que indicará que paciente no requiere ningún tipo de anticoagulación ni anti-agregación (CHA2DS2-VASc = 0). También el score nos informara el riego anual de ACV (Ataque cerebrovascular isquémico cardioembolico). La indicación y la evidencia del uso de este score viene incluido en la app. Posterior a esta calculo la app lo dirigirá a la evaluación de riesgo de sangrado con el HAS-BLED (También incorporado en la app), y el resultado se presentaría como bajo riesgo o alto riesgo de sangrado así: Si el HAS-BLED es &gt; 3 alto riesgo de sangrado que no contraindica la anticoagulación y solo para modificar los factores de riesgo identificados. En la app también hay lista adicional de factores de riesgo de sangrado usados en otros scores de riesgo. <br><br>Luego del HAS-BLED, la app lo lleva al valor del CHA2DS2-VASc que cálculo y hará la recomendación de anticoagulación o no. Para hombres anticoagulación oral si CHA2DS2-VASc &gt; 1 y para mujeres si CHA2DS2-VASc &gt; 2. Definida la indicación de anticoagulación la app lo dirige para que calcule la depuración de creatinina por la fórmula de Cockcroft-Gault (También se encuentra dentro de la app). Junto con las evidencias que soportan esta indicación. Si el cálculo de depuración de creatinina es: &gt; 30 mL/min, la app lo llevara a considera el uso de anticoagulantes orales directos (ACOD)[Apixaban, dabigatran o Rivaroxaban].

If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of the type of experiment wherein sound is reproduced by analyzing the vibrations of a bag of potato chips through a window in a silent video; that's basically why I accept that this app can work, and work well. It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",
            "Great app. I actually compared its Heart Rate results with a expensive BP Monitor that I have, and I was surprised to see that the Heart Rate reading was very close to the one my expensive BP monitor gave me. I recommend this app. It's a very handy thing to have on your phone when your away from home and can't take your reading with your regular medical monitor.",
            "I have a issue that specialists and doctors are finding hard to workout. This app just showed it occurring. So it does catch what heart is doing. Its not meant to diagnois but atleast you can save it and take to a professional for assessment.",
            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

            "I really appreciate this app. A good review and a great learning tool for practitioners.",
            "Only just started. Pretty fun and educational if a bit linear e.g. Ecg gives you the diagnosis then you still have to order tests to disapprove the others. However please make sure all cases are accurate/safe it just made me stop an AF patient's wafarin because he had no further symptoms of AF after a year. His CHA2DS2VASC score is 3 and anticoagulation should be lifelong. Can't move on in the case without choosing to stop it.",
            "A game long overdue , I hope other features will be added , e.g. ability to level up and campaigns, e.g. ability to access bonus features e.g. murmur audios (not a good example), etc. Alot of hard work went into this free app and it's much appreciated."

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",
            "This is a must have app. It helps you to monitor your stress levels! The monthly calendar is great so you can see how well you are doing at managing your stress. High recommend!"

However, keep in mind that many factors can influence the heart rate, including Activity level, Fitness level,  Body size, Emotion, etc. Generally, but not always, a lower heartbeat at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor if your resting heartbeat is consistently above 100 beats per minute or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heartbeat is below 60 beats a minute.\r\n\r\nWhat are heart rate training zones?\r\n\r\nHeart rate training zones are calculated using maximum heart Rate (MaxHR). Within each training zone, subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness. We have a similar definition to those used in Fitbit trackers:\r\n\r\n- REST ZONE (up to 50% HRmax): This considers as resting zone.\r\n\r\n- FAT BURN ZONE (50 to 70% of maximum): Recovery and warming up exercises should be completed in this zone. It’s called the fat burn zone because a higher percentage of calories are burnt from fat.\r\n\r\n- CARDIO ZONE (70% to 85% of HRmax): Most of the main exercise should be completed in this zone.\r\n\r\n- PEAK ZONE (greater than 85% of HRmax): This zone is ideal for short intense sessions (high-intensity interval training HIIT) to improve performance and speed.\r\n\r\nThis heart rate monitor app calculates and automatically saves your heart rate training zones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNNING\r\n\r\n- Heart rate monitor app should not be used as a medical device.\r\n- If you have a medical condition or worried about your heart condition please always consult your GP.\r\n- In some devices, the heart rate monitor app may make the LED flash very hot.",

            "Quite good but I'm not sure about the accuracy. I use it to record my pulse after exercise but it takes about half the scanning time to settle down and then I see it reducing until it's finished the scan. The final scan value is the one that's recorded so I suppose I need a fitness watch if I want a more accurate reading straight after exercise.",
            "So far so good. I had one descrepencie out of 10. The reading was off. My accuracy is important. I hit my highest weight ever at 330 - 5' 10.5°. I'm on a Pro-Form Stepper and it is amazing the results in 15 minute workouts. So today was my first to complete 15 min 6 1/5 laps without a pause. Walking to my bed edge and measure my rate. 128 bpm. My resting is 61 avg. So I'm trusting my health these numbers are accurate. My wife readings are higher which is also accurate.",
            "After the latest update, I'm always on 56, no matter if I'm running, laying, sitting. Just doesn't matter. I want the previous version back !!",
            "Close but not 100%. I work in Healthcare and have access to multiple devices. Direct comparisons and this is usually within 3-10%. Works fine for monitoring when I'm not at work.",
            "Overall it's quite helpful, with some occasional inconsistency. Measurements are a tad low, but close enough for a quick calculation to get the real reading."

        "description": "The new rhythm primer module presents the basics of reading electrocardiograms. The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation.",

All that for an app that already knows that I'd bought it and that I've been using it since my 1st Android phone, an HTC Legend or, in other words, for a long time. 👎",
            "Loved this App. Was *****. Helpful visual assist for calm focus that reduces heart rate. Asked me to BUY Premium App again today. hmm... Checked & quite a number of APPs & BOOKS in G00g1e P1ay Store Purchase History show BOGUS CANCELS & REFUNDS!! We're talking very real dollars (over $100+) GONE! AND, if you multiply this times hundreds, thousands, millions(?!) of G00g1e customers, then some H@CKER[S] (? Ex, or, current employees?) absconded with rather a LARGE chunk of $$$...?!!",
            "Used to be great, but now, it burns my finger it gets so hot (might be the new phone) and even though I paid for the pro version it's full of ads, the functionality is changed since I bought it. I don't want all these extra features, I just wanted a way to track my heart rate. Wish it were the old version still. It just feels cluttered and inefficient compared to the old app that I bought. I don't regret it but just check with a clock (count pulse for 10 sec x 5) and track on a spreadsheet.",
            "I had a paid version of this app when it wasn't subscription-based. And now it says I am on some free version and the only way to use it properly is by premium subscription. Wow! Talk about getting greedy. They could have come up with a new app with more features instead of crippling it for earlier paid users! It is useless now. Uninstalling it.",

        "description": "Learning the art of ECG interpretation requires intellect, commitment, effort and — perhaps most importantly — an organized approach. ECG Interpretation A - Z Approach\r\n\r\nECGs Made Easy?\r\n\r\nI imagine it is understood that learning all of ECG interpretation is going to take more than 10 minutes of your time and that it is not quite so easy. To be proficient, it will take a bit of effort. Some memorization and pattern recognition will be required. The more you see, the more you will remember. Having a pair of calipers is helpful.\r\n\r\nStep 1. Learn the Basics of a 12-lead ECG Tracing\r\n\r\nFirst things first. Knowing the basic parts of an ECG tracing will lay a good foundation for everything else that is to come. The different waves, complexes and intervals need to be ingrained in your brain. How many seconds is a full ECG tracing? How much time does each big box and each little box represent?\r\n\r\nThis is not the time to learn the crazy things such as the different P-wave morphologies that occur with atrial enlargements and ectopic atrial rhythms — but rather, just to know what the normal P wave looks like and what it represents. It’s a similar concept for the other parts of the ECG.\r\n\r\nRead ECG Basics.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Determine Heart Rate on the ECG\r\n\r\nTo determine whether bradycardia, a normal heart rate or tachycardia is present requires the knowledge to calculate the heart rate on the ECG. Remember to apply these techniques to both the atrial rate, measured by the rate of the P wave, and the ventricular rate, measured by the rate of the QRS complex.\r\n\r\nRead Determining Rate.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Determine Axis on the ECG\r\n\r\nThe axis on the ECG can give a clue to many different pathologic states. Unless you are going into electrophysiology as a career, the only axis that you need to measure is that of the QRS complex.\r\n\r\nBe sure to know the causes of left axis deviation, right axis deviation and when the axis is indeterminate (northwestern). Also, know the quick shortcuts to determine the axis.\r\n\r\nRead Determining Axis.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Learn Abnormal Heart Rhythms\r\n\r\nLearning a normal sinus rhythm was taken care of in Step 1. Now, learn the below rhythms like the back of your hand. Be sure to review multiple examples of each in the individual ECG Reviews and Criteria sections below.\r\n\r\nAtrial Fibrillation ECG\r\nAtrial Flutter ECG\r\nAtrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG\r\nAtrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT) ECG\r\nEctopic Atrial Rhythms ECG\r\nFirst-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block ECG\r\nIdioventricular Rhythms ECG\r\nJunctional Rhythms ECG\r\nMultifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) ECG\r\nSecond-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block Type I (Wenkebach) ECG\r\nSecond-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block Type II ECG\r\nSinus Arrhythmia ECG\r\nSinus Bradycardia ECG\r\nSinus Tachycardia ECG\r\nThird-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block ECG\r\nVentricular Tachycardia (VT) ECG\r\nWandering Atrial Pacemaker (WAP) ECG\r\n\r\nStep 5. Learn Chamber Hypertrophies and Bundle Blocks\r\n\r\nSometimes this can be the most difficult part. Atrial enlargements are not too bad, but the criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy can drive you crazy. No need to memorize then all, just the main two or three.\r\n\r\nLeft and right bundle branch are not too bad, either. The “bunny ears” are easy to spot in right bundle branch blocks — though not always present. Don’t forget to learn what a non-specific interventricular conduction delay looks like, as well.\r\n\r\nStep 6. Learn Acute MI and Ischemic ECG Findings\r\n\r\nStep 7. Learn the Everything Else Including Atypical ECG Findings\r\n\r\nStep 8. Review ECGs in Real Patient Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nStep 9.

The MiCOR is a unique wristband with built-in ECG sensor of medical grade accuracy, to monitor your cardiac function comfortably; anywhere, anytime. \r\n\r\nSimply press the ECG sensor for 30 seconds and your heart rate measurement is recorded and stored in the internal memory. The app then imports the data from the wristband onto your Android device, so you can view your information and even email or print it. The electrocardiogram is for doctors to understand your heart condition so they can tell if heart rhythm is normal or in atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nMedical grade ECG-sensor \r\nThe main feature of this medical grade ECG recorder is to capture reliable heart activity data and relay it to your healthcare professional. This ground-breaking technology offers the opportunity to simply monitor your heart rhythm at home, with no restrictions on your lifestyle or activities. You can take a shower, drive a car or go to the gym whilst measuring your heart rate. So as opposed to the traditional measurement of your cardiac functions with a holter and electrodes attached to your body, this easy to use wristband reflects your real cardiac function; anywhere, anytime.\r\n\r\nSince the traditional holter and electrodes measurement don’t allow you to do any activities that generally influence your heart rate, this innovative wristband may show arrhythmia and other cardiac abnormalities symptoms sooner. The use of it will decrease waiting time and therefore result in better and earlier treatment of your most important organ; your heart\r\n\r\nMultiple profiles\r\nThe app is tailored to allow multiple users to use the app with their own devices. So if you are using several MiCOR wristbands in one family, you can create a profile for each family member to view individual measurement history in only one app. \r\n\r\nSleep and activity tracker\r\nThe stylish wristband is easy to use, lightweight and comfortable to wear. In addition to the medical advantages, it also functions as an activity tracker and measures your steps, sleep and calories burned. \r\n\r\nGetting enough quality sleep is important for your health, well-being and your happiness. The MiCor tracks the duration and the quality of your sleep, and can provide you with a sleep diary on the MiCor app. This diary will inform you about sleeping patterns and further information about your sleep. By becoming more aware of your patterns, you can work to improve your sleep quality and more importantly; your overall well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Requires MiCor A100 wearable ECG recorder.",

The electrocardiogram is for doctors to understand your heart condition so they can tell if heart rhythm is normal or in atrial fibrillation.<br><br>Medical grade ECG-sensor <br>The main feature of this medical grade ECG recorder is to capture reliable heart activity data and relay it to your healthcare professional. This ground-breaking technology offers the opportunity to simply monitor your heart rhythm at home, with no restrictions on your lifestyle or activities. You can take a shower, drive a car or go to the gym whilst measuring your heart rate. So as opposed to the traditional measurement of your cardiac functions with a holter and electrodes attached to your body, this easy to use wristband reflects your real cardiac function; anywhere, anytime.<br><br>Since the traditional holter and electrodes measurement don’t allow you to do any activities that generally influence your heart rate, this innovative wristband may show arrhythmia and other cardiac abnormalities symptoms sooner. The use of it will decrease waiting time and therefore result in better and earlier treatment of your most important organ; your heart<br><br>Multiple profiles<br>The app is tailored to allow multiple users to use the app with their own devices. So if you are using several MiCOR wristbands in one family, you can create a profile for each family member to view individual measurement history in only one app. <br><br>Sleep and activity tracker<br>The stylish wristband is easy to use, lightweight and comfortable to wear. In addition to the medical advantages, it also functions as an activity tracker and measures your steps, sleep and calories burned. <br><br>Getting enough quality sleep is important for your health, well-being and your happiness. The MiCor tracks the duration and the quality of your sleep, and can provide you with a sleep diary on the MiCor app. This diary will inform you about sleeping patterns and further information about your sleep. By becoming more aware of your patterns, you can work to improve your sleep quality and more importantly; your overall well-being.<br><br><br>*Requires MiCor A100 wearable ECG recorder.",

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

        "comments": [
            "By itself the app is fine, but getting the data into other apps that need to track your weight is inconsistent at best. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Having to reset constantly is a pain.",
            "A POSITIVE: I like the app. It shows accurate BP measurements. Checked it against other BP monitors. Easy to keep logs. A NEGATIVE: Even when following manufacturers directions in relation to shutting the monitor off, the Qardio BP drains an exorbitant amount of battery power. The only way I can get a reasonable amount of battery life, is to remove batteries after each use...a bummer! I personally do not use it for anything else.",
            "Qardio is a great app for measuring your blood pressure. It is very easy-to-use and simple to use. The cuff will accommodate 14.6\" bicep. I am replacing a 10 year old omron. I like the way the app installs on your phone and the blood pressure readings appear in the app on your phone. I highly recommend the Qardio blood pressure monitor.",
            "Quick and easy to use. Matches the BP at my providers office, too. 1/29/20 - This device is still working well. It us easy to pack when traveling. 6/7/20 - frequently loses sync w/ Samsung Health requiring manual BP entry. 10/7/20 - it hasn't sync'd w/ Samsung Health for several months.",
            "Being able to monitor my own b/p has been a blessing!! There have been times when my b/p has been extremely high & yes extremely low letting my doctor view what's going on with my health. I encourage those who have hypertension to talk to their doctor about obtaining Qardio heart monitor."

        "description": "I’m a physician and a professional programmer, and I have an abnormal heart rhythm.  Like so many with an arrhythmia, I searched for an app that could monitor my rhythm, but none provided me what I needed, so I created this app. \r\n\r\nHere is what I think we arrhythmia sufferers need (and what HeartRhythm delivers): \r\n- Accuracy, so you can trust the results.\r\n- Rhythm collection in the background during exercise and rest.\r\n- Data storage for later review and to share with your heart specialist, if needed.\r\n- Graphs, charts, and tables that can be quickly understood.\r\n\r\nHeartRhythm is an Android app for monitoring your heart rhythm.  I developed this app when my arrhythmia, of years duration, quickly worsened over months, as did my frustration with the unknown. Was my arrhythmia severe enough to cause cardiac weakening, could I improve it with lifestyle changes, might other medications offer relief, or would I need an invasive heart procedure to destroy the arrhythmia-causing tissue in my heart? I wrestled with these questions and decided to create the app where I could demonstrate to my heart specialist the degree of my arrhythmia.\r\n\r\nMost heart rhythm apps use an inaccurate method of gathering heart rhythm data.  Its scientific name is photoplethysmography and works by the user sitting very quietly with one finger firmly covering both the cellphone's camera and LED flash.  The app then takes a series of \"images\" of the fingertip, analyzing each for the very slight color change with each heartbeat. The technique is simply too inefficient and insensitive to provide accurate rhythm information and requires the user to sit perfectly still. Think about it, is your cell phone camera capable of taking a thousand photos per second for the accuracy needed? No.\r\n\r\nAs scientists say, \"Garbage in, garbage out\".  If the technique for plotting exactly when each heartbeat occurs is inaccurate, then the heart rhythm assumptions based on that data are also flawed.\r\n\r\nAs a heart rhythm sufferer, you need an app capable of monitoring your heart rhythm when sweating heavily, breathing deeply or moving quickly during full exercise, as well as at rest.  I exercise daily and suffered frightening symptoms when exercising. The available apps could only monitor my heart briefly while sitting motionless.\r\n\r\nYou also need to collect hundreds or thousands of heartbeats in each session, not thirty seconds worth.  Photoplethysmography cannot do prolonged collection since the camera's flash becomes too hot to touch in seconds, not minutes.\r\n\r\nFor accuracy and active use, only an app that connects wirelessly to an external heart monitoring device will suffice. There is only several choices, but from great companies, such as Polar Electro and Sigma Sports.  They manufacture chest strap heart monitors the size of key fob.  Benefits include a Bluetooth connection (so no wires), affordability, sweat-proof, long-running on a simple watch battery, and accuracy.  They are available on Amazon too.\r\n\r\nData storage is on your phone, not on some costly cloud server, which allows you to compare, track, and correlate medication and lifestyle changes over many sessions. It's needed if your goal is to improve your arrhythmia. \r\n\r\nA goal is allow our users to review data at a glance.  This is more art than science,  is efficient and educational and provided with the right mix of graphs, tables and histograms. \r\n\r\nNow for the disclaimer.  While I am a  physician and a programmer, I did not design HeartRhythm as a diagnostic tool. It is designed for users who have been (or need to be) properly diagnosed with a known cardiac arrhythmia and wish to monitor their arrhythmia. HeartRhythm has not been reviewed by the FDA. Errors in data collection are expected.  The electrocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor are the gold standards in medicine for arrhythmia diagnosis.  HeartRhythm cannot compete with these technologies.\r\n\r\nMore information, including my blog, is found on https://HeartRhythm.app.",

Going to my Dr usually meant waiting a long time for another lab to run a halter monitor and I wanted info right away. Other rhythm monitor didn't let me break down the data and save it for my doctor like this app. I can store data from when I feel bad and give it to my Dr now. Turns out, I just needed a couple changes to feel better!"

I also wish one had to watch all videos before taking the exam(s) and that exams were longer on some of the courses (ACLS and PALS exams are good). Overall, it has some good courses, but they need to be more challenging. I rate 3 stars. That's the best I've rated on an online course."

            "Usefull App. Tracing was detailed enough for a cardiologist to identify a couple of rhythm issues after a run! Occasionally doesn't want to start live ecg, or record, or revert from 'view recording' to 'live' mode - need to restart app to clear up issue. And I agree with a previous reviewer, standard ECG 0.04 second graph background would be great. It seemed that deleting a saved file was all or none, no way to delete just one file ?? But this is a helpful app, thank you for all your efforts!",
            "Good start, but to be useful it's missing a few things. It should display on standard ECG graph paper and at the proper scale. Without that it can't be used to inspect rhythms since it's impossible to judge the distance between the P wave, QRS complex and T wave. It should also record heartbeat. Also should be able to add notes of what activity was occurring, eg, running, and have those notes in the file. Should be able to record a whole day. Good start but missing some key features",
            "First the good- doesn't demand I hand over my personal info before I can use it. Easy to pair to my H10. Easy to use. The not so good- the graph it generates looks like a Chihuahua on crack hopped onto a pogo stick and a used a magic marker on a wall. It looks nothing even remotely like an ECG reading and the scale of the y-axis appears to be fixed so I'm missing about 30% of my data. Four stars because it's not a nosy POS like all the other apps and has the potential to provide a useful ECG.",
            "You added useful facilities to the gadget but there is one. There is probably a heart rate data in the polar SDK. There is better to display it for live ECG & for recording ECG (every 30 seconds). On the horizontal axis, repeating the data is a lot of hours and minutes, and only seconds data is enough. Because as the runner speeds up, QRS graphs get closer to each other and disrupt horizontal data. Thanks for apps",
            "This app exemplifies the brilliance that exists in the basics. It's name tells you everything you need to know and performs exactly as advertised. I recently requested a new feature (output file storage selection). Matti quickly responded and implemented the request in a timely manner."

I've other apps for health, but I like this so much I encourage the programmers to expand into more health/ fitness areas.",

            "Great app. Great for privacy! No \"cloud\" (spying) required! Works reliably. Rotten controls for add: takes too long to spin those things back and forth. Also, no way to edit an entry, that I can see. Over all, very good. Recommend."

I am using the full version with a cheap external sensor. This configuration gives me more opportunities to experiment. The feedback screens are very well designed and provide excellent visual information. Cons: 1) If the sensor is connected after the application was once started the app freezes. It has to be stopped and deleted from memory to work again. 2)  An accidental touch of the screen could stop and save the current session and you have to start a new one.  I also think that the app will benefit from a more detailed help section and more information for users with little knowledge about coherent breathing.arch I have"

We have committed ourselves to take medical education one step further and have developed visually stunning and highly interactive content based on real life medical and scientific specifications. \r\n\r\nThis is the first augmented reality App to be rolled out in a series of Apps created and designed for medical education purposes.\r\n\r\nINSIGHT HEART - The human heart expedition\r\n\r\nUsing ARCore, INSIGHT HEART let's users easily scan their physical surroundings and place the three-dimensional heart without the need of predefined markers. Our virtual assistant ANI will guide you through various states of the heart.\r\n\r\nExplore the human heart like never before. Rotate and scale the high-resolution heart floating in front of you and feast your eyes on highly detailed 4k textures.\r\n\r\nTrigger impressive visualizations of various conditions, such as normal heart rate, myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Some of these conditions could never be experienced live!\r\n\r\nExplore this spatial application.

            "It kept saying it didn't detect anything no matter what I did. When it finally worked it said 40 bpm, not true. I didn't really like it. Just my opinion though.",
            "Used once and then it told me i had to purchase! Not free!!! Worked great when i did use it. It has weekly purchase options available, but i dont recall anything about a price being added after i downloaded it. Very unhappy about that.",
            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",
            "You have to provide a basic version for free . If it works useful way can go for premium version. I have seen very different heart ratings in 3 days ..Felt it is not working properly.. just uninstalling now",
            "this is the best Heart rate app I've seen in a long time. No bloat, continous measuring, a graph background to measure intensity, can toggle flash on or off and syncs with Google fit. Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away. It would be better if an audio beep was added for the heart rate but this is really good"

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2.

            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures 😢"

            "Cardiogram is a great app, but suddenly removed Cardiogram Care last week without alerting its users. The help pages online still have all the information about Cardiogram Care, but no explanation as to why it was removed. This was one of the main benefits of having a Fossil watch; now that the feature is no longer available, I may make the switch back to Fitbit without using Cardiogram at all. It's a rather disappointing change of service, especially when it happened without warning.",
            "The cardiogram doesn't update quick enough to tag things . I keep trying to update it myself so I can tag what's going on during that time and see how my heart rate was as well but it's not updating for the current time etc . I hope I'm making sense . How do I fix this if I can ? If I'm having symptoms etc I'd like to tag them as soon as possible .... Also my sleep time is not accurate . My fitbit will say like 7 hours and cardiogram says 3 ? I like the app so far besides those part :/",
            "Heard about Cardiogram. Downloaded and let it get my Google Fit data (which gets data synced from a Samsung watch). The Cardiogram UI is visually messy, all over the place, and even after reading the help and clicking around, it doesn't appear to show me anything useful!? I joined the deepheart study but nothing changed in the app. So, I dont see anywhere in the app that tells me how healthy I am and if there are any warning signs. So what's the point? Samsung Health already has heart rate zones",
            "I downloaded this app for Cardiogram Care which was included with my smartwatch purchase. While my watch was in for repair it seems that this was removed and now this app is just like any other with no reason to keep it. Now my watch is back I'm disappointed but I'm removing this bloatware because now it's unnecessary.",
            "Good app to complement running and syncs well with google fit. Downside is that it doesn't have support for Tiles so HR can't be easily seen without having to go into the app itself. Please add this feature as it will go well with the 5 min interval HR monitoring."

I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

Please recharge your account.\",and page needed to reload again, please tell me how am I supposed to recharge my account if the pop-up keep disturbing me in the process. 😡😡😡🤬🤬",
            "Doesn't update the data usage for dozens of hours. It's been 2 days since i have been using the mobile data as broadband service is down. N i have used it for streaming videos n it hasn't updated the usage in 2 days. It shows the updated number sometimes if you hit refresh but that's very rare less than 1in 20. Usually it would just show the old numbers even after hitting refresh. Also restarting the app doesn't change anything either. Disappointing service overall.",
            "I am writing this review regarding Airtel network in my area My network gets frequently disconnected completely for 5-10 seconds and then reconnect. If you are in a meeting or game you will be disconnected for a period of 10-20 seconds minimum. Totally disappointed with these kind of frequent fluctuations. Not sure about other areas.",
            "There is no option to talk with any official in the app. I did so many attempts on 121 and 198 regarding my bill. There is only limited options and hence we need to talk with official in person. But unfortunately I cannot get it. Airtel Thanks is not useful in this way. Pl give me number or show me how I can approach with your official to talk something which does not cover under this app. Thank you."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.",
            "Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",
            "I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190",
            "Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",
            "Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support."

Much obliged to you for this application! :)",

        "description": "Cardiology is the study and treatment of disorders of the heart and the blood vessels. A person with heart disease or cardiovascular disease may be referred to a cardiologist.\r\nCardiology is a branch of internal medicine. A cardiologist is not the same as a cardiac surgeon. A cardiac surgeon opens the chest and performs heart surgery.\r\n\r\nA cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases of the cardiovascular system. The cardiologist will carry out tests, and they may some do procedures, such as heart catheterizations, angioplasty, or inserting a pacemaker.\r\n\r\nClinical Cardiology: Current Practice Guidelines is an essential tool for the busy clinician, providing succinct yet detailed access to the most recent trial and guideline data supporting practice and patient management in cardiology. \r\n\r\nthis app, provides a solution. These recommendations are considered in the context of the latest research and evolving evidence most relevant to the clinician, to give detailed insights into how best to proceed with treatment. \r\n\r\nThis is discussed as part of 84 comprehensive chapters on pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. Each chapter offers concise information on definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of the disease, reflecting the latest published research. Following this is clear and instructive discussion of possible presentations and all clinical investigations that may be necessary.\r\n\r\nA guide to the management of common cardiological scenarios, this book offers the response of leading experts in each field to the more common, and often poorly dealt with problems of cardiology. It is a very useful 'how-to' guide, based on sound evidence.\r\n\r\nWhat drugs should be used to maintain someone in sinus rhythm who has paroxysmalatrial Fibrillation?\r\n\r\nHow do I investigate the relatives of a patient with sudden cardiac death?\r\n\r\nWhich cardiac patients should never get pregnant?\r\nThese are over 100 other intriguing questions are answered by leading cardiologists in this refreshingly up to date book. However, far from being bedtime reading, 100 Questions in Cardiology is an authoritative and practical guide to management of complicated situations. Written by cardiologists, it tackles the thorny problems that you may often have wanted to ask about but never dared.\r\n100 Questions in Cardiology uses the now acknowledged most effective means of presenting evidence – by starting with the frequently asked questions and answering them with practical, concise, and evidence based information. It will be an invaluable tool not only for qualified and trainee cardiologists, but also for general physicians involved in the care of cardiac patients.\r\n\r\nOne of the most time-consuming tasks in clinical medicine is seeking the opinion of specialist colleagues. There is pressure not only to make referrals appropriate, but also to summarize the case in the language of the specialist. Cardiology Explained is an essential tool in this task.

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

            "Been my favorite \"go-to\" photo editing app. Wish there was the same features for videos. But I dont take many of those. So I don't mind keeping it strictly to photo edits. My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "EDIT: there needs to be some kind of confirmation when spending gems. I just magically lost 25 gems and I don't know how ORIGINAL: It feels like the game is designed to keep non paying players poor. Many of the garden quests are not possible to complete without paying, and to skip them, you have to pay a month's worth of gems. The events are the same: impossible to complete without paying. The game itself is fun, I just wish they didn't make it so difficult to move forward if you don't pay",
            "Do not, I repeat do not! buy the golden pass. Its a rip off. Even though it says golden pass at each season, you can only use it for one season and then you have to repay to be able to keep using it. €5,50 is much for an option that would stay. But it's unbelieveably expensive for something that only works for one season... I either want my money back or I want to have the feature unlocked forever. Your choice Gram.",
            "Very addicting. But if i may make a suggestion on a useless feature? The screen lock is pointless, and the button is in a poor location. Having a screen lock feature on a game that requires you to move the screen doesn't make sense. But if it needs to be in the game, i suggest relocating its button. I' ve turned that thing on so many time just because an item appears in the bottom of the screen close to it. But other than that very good game",
            "I wish I could get more compasses by watching videos more often I would totally watch them to play more levels. It allows me to do it sometimes but in other games it is unlimited ad=more play, instead I have to wait a whole hour to get another compass to keep playing? That doesn't make sense. But I do love the game, it is addicting and fun to merge stuff. I just wish I could play for longer.",
            "So far a very fun game, althoughIhaven'tbeen playingbut about one week. The only downside that I have found so far is that if you want to play & collect items, you better bring your credit card to the table. The only way to get what you need and/or desire is to pay for it. All items (eggs, buildings, plants, etc) go up in price every time you expand or purchase it."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right now🤷🏻‍♀️. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game! I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

            "Don't get me wrong for rating the app with one star, I do love this app but, the problems are the ads, and when I tried to subscribe, it said I can't do it at the moment, so when I checked the app store for the apps that are (subscribed) the only one that showed up was viki. And guess what? I still have got few weeks until the subscribtion expires but still all the shows and movies are locked, so please tell me what is going on and what is the problem here",
            "Im unable to fastforward drama or backward it,each time i leave the app to do something when I'm back i have to start the same episode from the begining pls fix this,i appreciate your efforts on this app but still needs to do better,it is really annoying.",
            "I really like this app! My main concern is the advertisements. Okay, I'm actually not too bothered by how frequent they are, I'm a patient person and I understand that's how the app is able to run, but sometimes the ad has trouble loading and freezes. A 30 second ad will have me wait two minutes bc it takes so long to load. And I know I can get vikiplus to avoid ads but I'm poor. Besides that, the quality of the dramas are clear and the captions are well made!",
            "It's really wonderful application .it's help to find lots of drama here. Am satisfied with this.but the problem is with resolution because we can't adjust what we want, sometimes network can't help to watch in that time we only can help with adjust the resolution but here there is no adjustments in this application!. can you fix with that others wise it's a good app👍"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

Otherwise it's a great game due to graphics and everything and I've had decent enough luck because the luck is randomized so people shouldn't be complaining for not getting a feautured hero from non guaranteed summons, that's their fault.",
            "Ive been playing this game for about 4 o years now and im still playing this game after 4 years. So its good enough to keep my interest for about half a decade i think that definitely deserves 5 stars. I see a lot of comments complaining about summon rates but i think its just unlucky people who are mad at their luck. I usually get atleast one fetured hero in the period of how long the featured summon lasts and there is always a garuteed summon after so many tries ive got more than i can lvl",
            "Worst rates in any summons I've ever seen. Despite pity summons I still never get the hero I want and on the best banners I never get anything and no pity. I love this game but I'm done with it until money-team fixes their game. Red grade basically money locked so arena is useless now since all the cash shoppers automatically win due to gold frames. I am sick of it and just making a statement about it. AVOID THIS GAME.",

        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "It has stopped working properly. If you are exercising outdoors and it has stopped working, even the steps stop being recorded. Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

Thanks for accompany me. What a good memories. Shout out to exos heroes : learn from this game, don't be irresponsible and banned players for your mistakes.",
            "Would rate higher due to the fact the game is alot of. But can't rate higher simply due to the fact that as fun as this game is. It is already over 13GB of data on your phone, and with the new update it makes it even larger. This game is becoming more of a PC only type game instead of a mobile game. The Creators of this game need to invest as much time removing the useless parts of the game as they do in creating new content for it to balance it all out.",

            "This game is fun , it can also be a game for busy people . I'm a senior so I'm quite busy but this game have the \"auto\" which is really helpful , I can just do my thing while it auto it self . I hope all the event have auto so it would be easier for me / busy people UwU . Other things is I know that there aren't enough khmer people to gain a server but please make khmer laugauge available please I just want a khmer name / name my shiki khmer"

The team works hard to bring you an exciting new chapter every week. Uncover a new mystery in June&#39;s Journey every Thursday.",
        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "The game is a good game, dont get me wrong. But there are 3 big things that are issues for me. One, is that the game is very complicated. There is so much stuff when you open the menu, I feel it would be better even if it was a little more \"basic\". Also, there are lots of ads, which I mean the game has to make money. Lastly, it needs a strong internet connection to play, and I feel an offline mode would be nice.",
            "I have been playing this game for over 3 years and I was just starting to get somewhere with a purchased rod and reel. The posiden rod 5 stars stats were rather good then with a successful evolution to a 6 star rod it gives me garbage stats I would expect from a 3 star rod and no way to go back to my previous rod. The stats on evolution should be a comparison or better of the 2 rods your using to improve the one you already have. Not the garbage it gave me. You could answer your emails.",
            "Really cool option to play as if your phone is an actual fishing pole W/ phones gyro. You progress quickly & are given enough free loot to start and keep the game going as you progress to earn higher level equipment and achievements. Graphics are great, controls are very easy and straight forward. Also very accurate in the depiction of the different types of fish that you would actually catch. Game accurately depicts the fish that are indigenous to the areas you fish in the game. Overall GREAT!!",
            "If you cant play for a while you will lose your guild and all the money and hard work you put in will be give to someone on your team and they wont talk and don't fish much this suck by far thus the 1 star rating a bot in control of my guild you email for help and they tell you its nothing they can do you have to w8 till person misses 20 days or more im pissed as all hell because I worked at the hospital when rona popped up and had to work doubles i had no time to check in. I want all my $ back",
            "It should have higher quality graphics setting. Good game, but the graphics is still stuck in 2014. It doesn't look good on a FHD screen."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",
            "Best game but the fireworks are not working on my device. My phone is latest phone but I still have problms with fireworks. I changed settings many times like graphics, resolution battery saving but I still not getting fireworks in my gameplay. Please solve my problem. And developers should add the great khali in mayhem",
            "I have just one simple question, where is the fireworks in android? Also, the graphics is on high and it is in it's highest resolution (in-game). Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",
            "Game is good except for some glitches due to bad network. But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

It is important to determine factors that are predictive of death across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hence the risk stratification by GRACE score become a routine part in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) investigation for better risk-management and preventing death.<br><br>For more info contact us at:<br>www.imedical-apps.com",

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

The variety of programming is impressive and I am going to say that out of Pluto, Tubi, and Crackle....Pluto TV wins hands down. Movies are unedited which is awesome. Yes.....there are commercials, but they're brief and before you know it, you're back to what you're watching. Visually, the app is beautiful to use.",
            "The app is horrific. It is not user friendly in the slightest. The catagories are horribly unorganized and there is no way to search through them. If you want to watch something, you have to comb through the database by hand until you randomly find what you're looking for. The app's poor design and execution leads to it being nearly impossible to use, which is a shame considering that the concept of a free cable app is great.",
            "Not a one star because this app is great content wise but it has a MAJOR downfall. There is no search feature. Like come on.. I watch the ads that pay for the service but you won't let me search for a movie that I want to see? I can see this app being used by almost everyone but in its current state (which hasn't changed in over a year at least) its useless. Why would I want to \"enjoy\" the old feeling of clicking through channels just to see my favorite movie started an hour ago...",
            "Avoid this app. No search capability so if you know what you want to watch you must waste countless amounts of time sifting through the catalog or give up. To add insult to injury there are way too many ads and they run the same ones over and over. I watched a 45 min show and saw the same Airforce ad 4-5 times. Commercial breaks totaled 17 minutes on top of the 45 minutes of actual show. So ads accounted for 38% of total time which is way too much. Skip this app."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "It is an enjoyable game nice graphics and physics.my only thing would be to make the dpad floating and so can uused by either hand as I have no use of my left it would make it. Easier if all controls could be used by the right.",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

            "Great game, includes a lot of features and has a great community. You can get tons of cars, get certain parts for them, and even tune the parts. You can customize graphics and controls at a very advanced level. I just wish they had less bugs every now and then and had better matchmaking time. If the game blew up or got popular this wouldn't be a big problem for players. If you want to play get ready to spend tons of time, money doesn't come very easy.",
            "Hello! I've been having this issue with the game after updating it to the latest version(20 oct 2020) . I play by signing up by Google play for my account ,but after the update , It just keeps spamming the message \"Failed to Connect\" over and over again ,even though I have a good Internet connection . Hope you can find why and please let me log into atleast something ,neither link in ,nor guest account works for me as well......oh ,and one more thing,Great job ,best drift game I've ever played!",
            "Updated review after over a month of playing: I still really love the game but honestly it is just too difficult for a phone game. Another thing, the Sponsors... I have 2 sponsors that want me to get a 10 win streak without losing online... yeah, right. I've gotten 7 and it is SO frustrating to restart. Completed sponsors are not showing as well. I want this game to be amazing! Edit: AI lead driver sometimes gets an insane speed boost and just leaves me in the dust. May have to do with lag",
            "I've been playing this game for over a year now and I've only had minor issues until now. After this update I played a couple times fine with no issues but the next time I loaded in, it told me my account didn't match my google account and if I try to log in to my account it says locked. I've used this \"locked\" google account for a long time now. I love playing this game it's real fun and I hope to see it launch on consoles but as of now I cant log in",
            "Can we PLEASE go back With this new \"update\" from October 20, 2020 the game sucks, this game was so fun and now I actually HATE IT! The controls are horrible now, there's no feedback and when you put the quality maxed out it looks 10 times older that it used to. I've enjoyed this game for so long and now this update makes me never want to play again"

            "since the last update ...after playing the game for 15 minutes or so the game starts to lag bad....and sometimes when im running live races my phone completely reboots which is not normal...im using a moto z4 with Android 10...and before you say anything about my phone there is nothing wrong with it...its a server issue or issue with the game app...please fix this!!!!!!!!",
            "I've got a few ideas to make the game that much better.. first, there needs to be rewards for unlocked achievements. Better rewards for rare achievements and so on. Second, car prices need to be reduced, as soon as you finish a career and need to purchase another vehicle the amount won for finishing the series isn't enough to cover the cost of even the cheapest make. Final tweak, the pairing for drag and drift is a bit off and alot of times you get paired with vehicles outside your class.",
            "LOVE the game. Exciting, entertaining and addictive. things I don't like about the game are, this game drains my battery like a muthasuka. For real. The money to takes upgrade is acceptable but the winnings are a drip (not drop) in the bucket in comparison. If you don't spend your winnings properly in the beginning, you will be (almost) forced to spend REAL money to progress later. Game itself is amazing but the pace of progressing is making it boring.",
            "This is game has its ups and downs but its great. I also have a great request. Look, I know this may be rare for a car game like this but could you guys add an ATV into the game? For instance: Raptor 700R se. I think the game would be alot more interesting if it had a motocross vehicle in it 😀. Maybe you could add an ATV to the Honda brand. Not only Honda makes cars but ATVs too. So yeah. Could you guys add one please🙂. It would make the game better. And please add Yamaha 2020 Raptor 700R",
            "Just started playing this morning and if you're one of those people that gets peed off when every time you hit a back button or click on something they try to sell you in-app purchases then you may want to steer clear of this game. Graphics good gameplay good but damn every screen you go to they try to sell you a mechanics package for 50 bucks and a car for a hundred bucks it's a game and I don't know if I like it yet so no I do not want to spend that much money. Ridiculous"

            "i love this game alot, ive been playing it for quite a while now since only a few characters were out and running. the game play is good, graphics, everything. i first i thought i was lagging because i had bad internet but now i just realized that my phone was just old. besides that, theres one issue. cost for essence and characters are WAY too much, some people was hundreds of dollars on this game for skins. can you maybe lower the price. it really isnt fair.",
            "The characters, abilitys, gameplay, and everything else is great! It takes a little while to get used to the sensitivitys and controls but its nice. The only problem im having is when im hiding and the hunter (starter hunter) is like so far away they cant possibly see me but come straight toward me, its confusing and makes me a little frustated but overall its an amazing game that has great graphics, gameplay, and very creative story line!",
            "The app is good. I liked playing it. It was really fun. But when the maintenance was done I started lagging even worse than before and it says that my internet connection was so low but its completely fine. My connection was all the way up. I was so close where my internet comes from but I still lag. I would have given a 5 star review but the lagging was so bad and worst than last time. And also, fix the camping, it sucks. Fix these problems please NetEase",
            "The reason why I gave Identity V 4 stars is because, it's a really good game and I love to play it but sometimes, I just lag a lot. I ever went to 995 ms and I could never get green ping. My wifi is fine, there's nothing wrong with it and my storage isn't full too. I just can't enjoy Identity V that much since it's lagging. I can't even walk properly since its so laggy. My normal ping is usually red like 325 ms and I'm okay with that, just today and yesterday, the ping was 995 ms.",
            "The game is absolutely phenomenal in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. However after a while the gameplay gets old and the unclear, barely existent story doesn't help either. The gameplay is also unbalanced as the variety of survivors and their special abilities are completely overshadowed by the hunter's. This is a very addicting game to play for a couple weeks but after that it begins to become boring, repetitive and annoying. The game also requires a powerhouse of a mobile device to run."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "I love Dragons, so this is very enjoyable for me. Still learning the game only level 86 i think, so still a lot to do to master the game. Update 10/16/2020 I am now over level 110 my dragons are getting stronger and accomplishing more in the gane, it just keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth 5 star rating and if it were possible 10 star. Keep up the great work everyone!!",
            "I'd rate this game 5⭐, but everytime I try to watch an ad (for extra rewards), it keeps saying \" No ads available \" , then after about 3 minutes of try to get the ad to play, the game crashes, and have to wait another 2 minutes for the game to load again...If this issue gets fixed I'll change my review to 5⭐, but as it currently is, the game is practically unplayable. (Suggestion: if there's no ad available, you could have it auto give the rewards. Rather than having the game constantly crash.)",
            "This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics! The game play is easy to learn and use. I like that the dragons look lifelike versus other games where the dragons look more like a cartoon. I only gave 4 stars because you can't use a dragon's special weapon until a certain criteria has been reached in the game, which I haven't been able to reach yet.",
            "I've been planning this for a couple of months now and I find it fun and easy to play even though I cannot buy anything with cash because Google locked me out of my account. It's super addictive and got some of my friends and family to start playing too. I only need to spend about 20 minutes or so 3 or 4 times a day and I in the top 40% of the server.",
            "Extremely fun BUT... one of the most expensive games if you want to try to support the devs. If things were cheaper I'd actually spend some money, but 25 + a month for auto play and no adds... no one time purchase options. 30+ for battle passes... The high prices forced a bad rating for a great game. I will probably search for another game to support. Dropped to a 1 star, legion chat always disappears leaving you with no idea about who has asked questions or anything. Pathetic devs."

            "You will see s lot of comments from people in regards to logging out of the game with a healthy chip balance only to log in the next day for them to be gone. I'm afraid this is common with huge, many people I know on the app have had their chips stolen with no reimbursement, myself included. 3 years ago they changed the lottery. When they did, I had 3 gold and 1 silver. Today, all that time later, I still have 3 gold and 1 silver. Do not waste your money on these in particular!",
            "Things are looking up. Still hard to get Gold puzzle pieces, but maybe that will change too. I hate the pop ups, but I gotta admit, I do love the games. I recently had an issue, and usually if you complain, nothing get solved, but FINALLY, Huuuge took care of it. Like I said ,things are looking up. I believe in giving credit where its due. Keep it up. Diamonds are useless, I wasnt looking or asking for them. GOLD PUZZLE PIECES is what I was talking about. I havent finished a GOLD PUZZLE.",
            "Even with fake money to be won you'd think the slots would at least keep it interesting so you can play for a bit. It's a major rip off if you spend real money. Also they've tightened the frequency of acquiring a bronze,silver or gold puzzle piece. You'd think they wouldn't be as tight as real slots since,after all...it's fake money. So for that... I'd give it less than one star if possible.",
            "Everyone do not even waste your time on this game, Its fixed. Its designed to make you spend your hard earned money and there is no getting ahead in this game. The very start you win a lot and then once you get into it, they take all your coins. You bet $200. Spin 3 times and win $5 ..its so obvious. Then if you email them and or write a review, some homosexual will respond with something so retarded like, keep trying maybe your luck will change.. trust this review and just run away. Its trash",
            "If you want a real view of this app doing its job look on YouTube for huuuge casino (huuuge ripoff) it is designed to prey on individuals who spend money make in-game purchases. If you spend a dime on this game youll regret it. It has good games but the expense it ridiculous and idiotic. Based on real slots well real slits pay REAL MONEY you dont but your game requires its players to pay to play. Or you could use your 2 spins worth of (freebies) a day.... dumb!"

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "absolutely loved this app. I have been using it for months but after the recent update, they made the makeup tool vip. I'm probably gonna delete the app now since it was my most used tool and i can't afford it now",
            "This app has been pretty valuable for me over the years that I've been using it. I tolerated when they decided to lock some features, since the more essential tools remained free and are uniquely useful enough to keep the app. I just had to look elsewhere for the other stuff. But when I went to use it today, I noticed they locked even more features - the essentials, aka the tools they've been most notable for. A pretty foolish move, honestly. So I'll be deleting.",
            "Reshape tool now requires a paying subscription, and it's not cheap! You used to be able to use it, you just needed to watch an ad whenever you saved your photo, but I guess they've gotten greedier. It was the only reason I used Facetune at all - all of the other tools are free on many other apps. Save yourself the trouble and money, just download any free photo editor.",
            "Certain things aren't free anymore, I don't like how you guys are taking the best free features away just to force people into subscribing. I also see how you guys made some features free which are tools I don't use for editing. This used to be the perfect app for selfie editing, for a long time too! But now it's useless to me. You guys are a sad case. I would give it 5 stars but no thanks. Uninstalling",
            "When I first downloaded this only a few of the edit options weren't available for free. It seems every time I go to edit now, more free things are getting taken away. Before it was reasonable, it's just ridiculous at this point. Looking to try different apps because trying to force users into buying your subscription is insane."

I recognize that people who support the game more via purchases deserve to win, but I just wish Bandai could make the brackets more even (i.e. by player level) instead of totally random",

My internet connection is fine (even my mobile data), I still can play other games. But this game is not letting me do so now. It's frustrating. Please fix it ASAP! Also, the game closes forcefully after I try to reconnect a few times. I feel like I'm giving up this game soon IF it still don't fix it.",

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "MashahAllah, this is a great app with everything in one place. I absolutely love the way they have put the exact meaning of each word underneath, at last I am beginning to learn the words in Arabic which is benefitting me so much. I haven't figured out how to use audio yet which I am sure will enhance my experience. I highly recommend this app for non-Arabic speakers and those, like me, who are reverts to Islam. There is so much knowledge to be gained from one app. Well done",
            "Hi I like the new interface. Got 2 suggestion: 1) Make it able to read by pages as well. After salah I'd read 2 pages. Say in surah alBaqarah I want to read page 10 and 11. Without this feature I have to key-in verse 62 to 76 which is cumbersome. 2) Allow us to donate thru upgrade with fixed price. Reason is I dont use credit card. Google play has option where it allows me to pay by crediting it to my telco monthly bill. Make free then remind the user to upgrade (donating); be creative in this.",
            "The apps search functionality needs improvement. Example: I searched using your translation, \"the most\" for aqwamun as in Sura 17, al isra Search comes with 0 found. Explain how to use the search function most effectively. Also, Search function doesn't work if I use the Quranic word. Example: I searched using al Qur'an but it came back saying 0 found. This app has many nice features. I hope you will continue to improve it by making the search functionality more effective and efficient.",
            "Definitely the BEST Qur'an app. It has everything that you need, it actually shocked me how good the app is! Recommended if you want to read and memorize The Qur'an. The features I like most are the word-by-word translation and the vast variety of murrotal that we can play ayah-by-ayah. I really like this app, thanks for creating this. 😊",
            "Assalamualaikum, Please add a function that we can hear Arabic (Al Afasy) and English translation (with gap) at the same time. I loved this app so much. Many of Quran app have this function to hear 2 audio at the same time. If you create a function that one for Arabic recitation and another one for translation recitation in many language or at least English translation then we will be very happy only for the sake of Allah. You guys updated this app frequently i love this if you add this functio"

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

When I have one open in a different app, the alarm stops the metronome and I have to go back into that app to restart it. One in this app would make it handsfree and restarting is not forgotten. Have the cycles continuously restarting, for same reasons. A setting for the phone screen to stay awake when the app is running.",

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."
