            "Used on S10+. The flash light became so hot it started hurting my finger. I turned on the flash without the app and it was fine. I think it increases the intensity of the light to max and it gets scorching hot. Did not have this problem when I used it in my S8+.",
            "I cannt even finish test because of very high temperature of camera light. Almost burned my finger. Om Samsung 10s.sorry something wrong with your software. And dangerous.",
            "Latest update causing weird issues. Needs fixing.",
            "I used to rate this app a 5star, but then they got rid of continuous monitoring and anytime my finger moved a bit I had to start it up again. I use this app to help with my anxiety, but now these ads pop up and I have to wait before I can use it again. Absolutely the worst thing to happen during a panic attack! So sadly, after many years of use, I'm going to have to uninstall and find an alternative.",
            "this app I've got to say is pretty accurate.. the reason I say that is because I have a medical device that check's your heart rate and oxygen level..now and then I check my heart rate with my cell phone with the heart rate app and compare this app showing my heart rate with my medical device,,which goes over your index finger and there is only 1 or 2 point difference everytime that's pretty good. works good but don't substitute this app from anything you might be using now tommy g So,Cal,"

            "Quite good but I'm not sure about the accuracy. I use it to record my pulse after exercise but it takes about half the scanning time to settle down and then I see it reducing until it's finished the scan. The final scan value is the one that's recorded so I suppose I need a fitness watch if I want a more accurate reading straight after exercise.",
            "So far so good. I had one descrepencie out of 10. The reading was off. My accuracy is important. I hit my highest weight ever at 330 - 5' 10.5°. I'm on a Pro-Form Stepper and it is amazing the results in 15 minute workouts. So today was my first to complete 15 min 6 1/5 laps without a pause. Walking to my bed edge and measure my rate. 128 bpm. My resting is 61 avg. So I'm trusting my health these numbers are accurate. My wife readings are higher which is also accurate.",
            "After the latest update, I'm always on 56, no matter if I'm running, laying, sitting. Just doesn't matter. I want the previous version back !!",
            "Close but not 100%. I work in Healthcare and have access to multiple devices. Direct comparisons and this is usually within 3-10%. Works fine for monitoring when I'm not at work.",
            "Overall it's quite helpful, with some occasional inconsistency. Measurements are a tad low, but close enough for a quick calculation to get the real reading."

            "So far so good. This app keeps pace with my dedicated finger pulse/oximeter (choiceMMed OxyWatch C29) Yeah, sometimes some patience is needed, the app will tell you when it's reading & when it's done. (My platform: Samsung Galaxy Note 8) UPDATE; Profound sadness:... My NEW platform is a Samsung Galaxy \"Note 20 Ultra 5G\". This app won't work (incompatible) on that platform. 😪",
            "Works but not too sure about the calibration. Bigger problem... The free version only allows 3 readings per day?! Wouldn't it make more sense for the pay version to include things like history but allow unlimited readings? Not going to uninstall it but absolutely would not consider paying for it due to this.",
            "I tried this app several times. Oxygen level says 99%. I have COPD, and have never been over 96% any time I've been checked at a clinic. I also have a Pacemaker that when at rest, my heart always is at 66 BPM. This App shows 61 BPM. I would only be able to play with this. I'd never trust it because my health is more important. If you need to count on it, buy one from a Pharmacy. I did.",
            "This was the first oximeter app that actually picked up my heartbeats or oxygen spo2 settings at all. So I am pretty happy with it right now. 9/30/2020 EDIT: After first usage yesterday evening, I went ahead and paid for the premimum version. Have managed, with quite abit of difficulty, to get it eventually to read my oxygen sat level and heart beat but have not been able to get it to store the data. Not quite so happy with 8t today, sadlyy• EDIT: rebooting the phone got it all working properly",
            "This is the only app in the store that has the functionality to measure the spo2 values.. the readings are consistent with an actual oximeter.. got the platinum edition.. Only feature I'm missing is the ability to store different profiles for different people.. also an option to disable reading on start.. Other than these, this is an awesome app :)"

If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",

It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",

            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

It is extremely simple to use, very accurate and records and stores results, giving me something very meaningful to show my cardiologist. One addition I'd like to see is a small text field to allow a recording to be annotated with activity information to add important context.",
            "This app has picked up on irregularities well. And is accurate in detecting rate. But I really wish there was a way to make a note to say what was going on when I used it at that particular time. Something other than \"resting\", \"warm up\" etc. Sometimes I get palpitations and will check my rate. Would be nice to be able to add a note like \"palpitations while cooking dinner\". Then I can fill my doctor in when I see him next.",
            "Best! Ive used many... I suffer from mental and physical health issues. When my anxiety shoots up, I have to do breathing exercises, and I have to monitor my heart rate. So I know what, and when things are happ. This app really is incredible that works immidiate, and you can print/Share out your own cardiograph!!! That is huge for me I mean huge! You can go back to different dates, whatever you want to do if you're looking for something to monitor your heart rate I absolutely recommend this!",
            "clean and simple. this type of app measure bpm by colour change noted by camera. you can see how fast your heart beat by covering camera with finger and make sure flashlight on and light goes throught finger. open video camera with flashlight on. you will see slightly color change on screen with heartbeats!",
            "This does not use the flash on my phone and does not seem to take reliable measurements as compared with other similar apps. Great interface but more work needed."

I was getting stressed and searched for heartbeat app on playstore, this gave me a precise perusing of what my normal pulse was for my age. Exceptionally intrigued. Much obliged to you for this application! :)",
            "I like the clean look of this app. It's also easy to use and nice colours. Best one of the kind. Accurate and you can save and tag your results too. This new feature of medicine stock is best for maintaining records in first aid kit.",
            "I luv this app. I can easily see my heart rate at the gym while I workout with the gorgeous display. My invariably low blood pressure foils most heart rate apps but not this one. This app had me right out of the gate. I emphatically recommend this one.",

            "App is very consistent. I do not like having to use a social media sign in order to utilize all features. II consider Facebook and Google invasive with FB spreading Fascist rhetoric. I simply want an effective heart rate tool."

            "It kept saying it didn't detect anything no matter what I did. When it finally worked it said 40 bpm, not true. I didn't really like it. Just my opinion though.",
            "Used once and then it told me i had to purchase! Not free!!! Worked great when i did use it. It has weekly purchase options available, but i dont recall anything about a price being added after i downloaded it. Very unhappy about that.",
            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",
            "You have to provide a basic version for free . If it works useful way can go for premium version. I have seen very different heart ratings in 3 days ..Felt it is not working properly.. just uninstalling now",
            "this is the best Heart rate app I've seen in a long time. No bloat, continous measuring, a graph background to measure intensity, can toggle flash on or off and syncs with Google fit. Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away. It would be better if an audio beep was added for the heart rate but this is really good"

Also I have to keep pressing on my screen to keep it awake. It's like the player doesn't know a video is playing. When opening pdfs, there's always that bar at top saying the filename. It's obstructive, because generally people have to read PDFs in landscape mode and that bar takes up annoying amount of space. Why not have bar at top go away if you scroll up a little.",

You can only see a handful of previously assigned projects, so if you wanna see what you need to catch up on you're out of luck.

Frustrating for sure but not the end of the world. I do like tracking my workouts on the app rather than email. However, that has now stopped too on 7/27/19. The instant tracking is motivating. Again, not the end of the world. It would be nice if you could come up with a fix for all of these problems. Your gym is a great quality workout place tho. Thx!"

            "I find this, in conjunction with the Polar OH-1 the best combination to track my fitness and workouts. Easy to share information. I had a minor glitch with it not syncing with a pair of Samsung devices. I notified the debug/development team and they jumped on it and resolved the issue with an update within 4 working days. superb customer service and top notch app. Highly recommended. I have been using it daily for 10 months now.",
            "I want to get this but won't spend $20 until Android features are updated. The look and UI are excellent, but compared to the iOS version, it lacks features such as calendar, insights and details. Not to mention the integration with third party services is meh. Haven't seen major upgrades since I looked at it a year ago. When they arrive, I'll subscribe.",
            "Since I'm paying for this it would be great to be able to customize my workout list on my galaxy active 2. I've used this app on my apple watch when I had an iphone and LOVED it. Hate to see that I don't get all the same features, but still paying the same price. Thanks for the quick response from the developer! It has been so long since I had my apple watch I thought it was the same price. My bad! Can't wait for future updates 😬👍🏻",
            "It's pretty good...Galaxy 3 Watch, Google Pixel 3XL. No, it's not as immediately synched or as just plain constant as Samsung health, but it's got some cool metrics, and a great display. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. It's good tech.",
            "It's an awesome app! helps me track the intensity on my workouts and I love that you can share your info in the community feed etc."

        "description": "Turn your smartphone into your personal Heart Rate Monitor!\r\n\r\nHeart rate or heartbeat is an important measure of health and fitness. Using the Heart Rate Monitor app, you can now measure and monitor your heart rate! And also use it for optimizing your exercise and to track your progress.\r\n\r\nWhy is this the best heart rate monitor app?\r\n✓ Incredibly accurate in measuring your heartbeat. \r\n✓ Free with unlimited heart rate measurements. \r\n✓ Multiple user profiles. Track the heart health of your family members in a single app. \r\n✓ Save and share your heartbeat graphs with your health care provider. \r\n✓ Enhanced by Health Infinity insights.\r\n✓ Connect to Google Fit.\r\n✓ Backup your measurements securely.\r\n\r\nHow to use the Heart Rate Monitor free app to measure heartbeat?\r\n★ Place and lightly hold your index finger against the back camera lens and flashlight.\r\n★ It uses your phones built-in camera to track color changes on the fingertip that are directly linked to your pulse. \r\n★ Do not press too hard, otherwise, blood circulation will be altered and the results could be affected.\r\n★ Remain calm and try not to move too much during the measurement, as this can compromise measurement accuracy.\r\n★ Do not measure with cold fingers when the blood circulation is poor.\r\n\r\nIs it accurate?\r\nHeart Rate Monitor is highly accurate as it uses the same technique that medical pulse oximeters use. It does not need any external hardware. \r\nThe app then uses our Award winning Heartbeat Fusion algorithm used by Health Infinity for detecting the heart rate accurately. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Normal Heart Rate?\r\nA normal heartbeat for adults ranges from 60to 100 beats per minute (BPM). However, keep in mind that many factors can influence it, including Activity level, Fitness level, Body size, Stress, Emotion, Cardiovascular health, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Resting Heart Rate?\r\nYour resting heart rate gives you a view of your heart's fitness. It varies depending on your age and training level. A very fit and athletic person has a lower resting HR than someone who is less active. Eager to know if your fitness level has improved? Measure your heartbeat on a regular basis and monitor the progress of your resting heart rate. \r\n\r\nFitness Usage:\r\nIt is also very suitable for people who would like to measure their workout intensity e.g Running, Gym or any kind of training. It is perfect for High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) or Cardio.\r\n\r\nMultiple User Profiles:\r\nYou can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them can have their own individual measurement history.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well-lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\r\n- This application should not be used as a medical device.\r\n\r\nFor Health App Developers:\r\nUse our framework to add Heart Rate measurements to your app. Contact us for documentation and sample code. \r\n\r\nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heart-rate-monitor\r\n\r\nMade with ♥ by Droid Infinity!",

            "I measured twice using this app, and it said my HR was 49 and then 59. I manually took my pulse, and it was 88. That is a pretty big difference! Seems useless to me.",
            "after downloading app, attempted the finger reader 3 times, would not read. Uninstalled the app then reinstalled it to be sure it wasnt user error, still would not read. Downloaded another app, works beautifully. Uninstalled this app due to not working as expected.",
            "Tried it out while in a rested state and it came back in the normal range. Only thing I dont like is I have to put my fingers on the camera lens as opposed to the screen. Other than that not a bad app",
            "Having episodes of my heart beating to fast, this will let me know when and how often my BPM is to high. I love the graph it has, so I can see the history of my BPM at a glance."

You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

Run app. Get the meter running on finger, you should have ur BT on and select Berry before you start above app. If all goes well a pop up of meter device will open in one of the app pull down settings. Turn on Beep option (opp) but handy. Should come to life after that. Meter Display is very bland, needs colour and more 3D Look",

Overall connectivity issue, user change is not proper and no histry data show option. Lot of improvement pending in app and device connectivity issues...",

Click search icon in top corner, look for berrymed address, click berrymed and now device will connect. Now that device is paired with phone. Next use you can click start and device should auto.atically connect. Make sure your phone bluetooth is on. Tested on Samsung galaxy s4, samsung note 9, iphone 7 and samsung tablet all working.",

Measuring the rate of your heart during exercise (or in rest phase) can help you determine when you&#39;re pushing your body too hard or need to push it harder to achieve the level of fitness you are seeking.<br><br>Your resting heart rate varies depending on your age and training level. A very fit and athletic person has a lower resting heart rate than someone who’s inactive. Eager to know if your fitness level has improved? Measure your heart rate on a regular basis and monitor the progress of your resting heart rate.<br><br><br>WARNING: This is not a medical product.",

Only time will tell if the accuracy is consistent and I would certainly pay for pro version.",

My finger was starting to get hot trying to get it to pick up, finally just gave up and uninstalled.",

I've other apps for health, but I like this so much I encourage the programmers to expand into more health/ fitness areas.",
            "Easy to understand and use. Also it's nice to be able to export the result. The graphics very clean and clear! The only thing missing is that I can't choose which account of Google I want the automatic backup goes.",
            "Easy to use. I like that it shows the stages of hypertension. It would be nice though if you can write notes for each reading such as reading taken while sitting a few minutes or lying down, with what type of medicine, etc",
            "I really like the application it's easy to read and the explanations are clear. Everything is clear and easy. It motivates me to take my pressure and have a comfortable idea of my health. Because of this application I am in control. Thanks",
            "Great app. Great for privacy! No \"cloud\" (spying) required! Works reliably. Rotten controls for add: takes too long to spin those things back and forth. Also, no way to edit an entry, that I can see. Over all, very good. Recommend."

            "They make you register and put in your age, weight, height and gender, before you can see if your device will connect to their app. In my case (and many others) it doesn't work, it scans for a device but won't find anything. I highly suggest you STAY AWAY!!!",
            "Works fine for me. Whatever the problem was with all these commenters failing to register and login, I dunno. The cheap oximeter device works fine (Jumper model JPD-500F, for $24 on eBay). The app connects to it by Bluetooth, records the data, saves the data, graphs a summary, AND allows you to share the stats and graph by email/Facebook/text message just fine. The three things measured are the pulse rate, the SpO2, and the very handy Perfusion Index (showing how solid the readings really are). The settings screen even adjusts the min/max for these 3 data that will trigger a beeping alarm if the reading gets too high or too low. Nice! . . . . . These features work in BOTH of the Jumper-Medical apps currently in the Google app store: the \"JUMPER Health\" app for all their devices and also the \"CareMeOximeter\" app for only the oximeter device. . . . . . The only feature I still wish for is to export a .CSV file, so that a spreadsheet can analyze the raw measurement data. And maybe to zoom in on the pulse graph line, to see whatever detail might show up there. . . . . . Nice app, since the latest update.",
            "I would like to use Sop2 sensor but first step in the app is to registering. You can't use app if you are not registered. What is it? Why do I need register to check sensor? USELESS APP! Removed.",
            "I can get it to pair with my Samsung S9+, but you must pair it everytime you want to use it. Once the app is open and the Oximeter is turned on they should pair automatically. If you don't want to record your data go into your phone setting and turn it off. The only one that needs to be allowed is your location.",
            "Haven't worked in my device. After being registered properly, can't make a connection to Bluetooth. So, It is big an issue and badly disappointed for me 😔😔😔"

            "It takes a hell of long time to step back to 1957 using the date picker you use. Is there any way to remove unwanted boxes like blood glucose from the lists. Feedback function in the app doesn't work. Graphic scales on all graphs appear to run from 0 to 250, including temperature. Weight graph is a hundred pounds light.",
            "I will happily change this to 5 stars if I can ever figure out how to analyze the vitals other than just weight and glucose. Easy to use app and I really love it except for not being able to figure out analytics. Also although I wish the weight chart was right, it is way off on the graph. Probably 100 lbs.",
            "Good App. Suggestions for further improvement. 1. Should have single input screen for all vital signs. Data then should be displayed in respective vital signs report. 2. Graphs should have to ability to: A. Show hourly trends as well as weekly/ monthly / yearly trends. B. view all vital signs in one graph as well as selected vital signs only.",
            "Simply excellent. Pls allow to record time of the day during which weight is taken. It is possible to compare weight during various times.",
            "I think this app is great. It does what it says It's very easy to use. Although I would like to be able to print all my data within a date range in one report to send to my doctor. Also how do I retrieve my data in the cloud? Just updated and app keeps crashing and will not open."

            "Inaccurate. Gave it 2 stars because I like the idea of the app, but the heart rate was consistently 10-20 bpm above my Garmin heart rate monitor (which is trusted) and the actual pulse in my wrist - way off. The app consistently told me I have an arrhythmia, but said the same for everyone who tried it - including my red sofa cushion which is apparently also bradycardic lol. I'm sure I was on the camera lens well, and remained very still. If you download this app, don't take it too seriously.",
            "Not sure what i think about this yet. Ive been having chest pain for over a mo now. This says arrhythmia & bradycardia then normal & tachycardia. Bradycardia is something I often have w/ 42-60bpm but ER says panic attacks not arrhythmia and tells me call a shrink! I STILL HAVE CHEST PAIN & KEEP PASSING OUT! Ugh",
            "Keeps saying I have an arrhythmia, so I put it on my cats back, says her heart rate is 61 (not accurate) and that she has an arrythmia. Not even close, don't put any faith into this app at all people",

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",
            "This is a must have app. It helps you to monitor your stress levels! The monthly calendar is great so you can see how well you are doing at managing your stress. High recommend!"

It uploads from the app but it would be nicer to use a sync program I use for other files.",

            "Excellent and simple to use app. I use it with my scosche rhythm plus and it works perfectly. The graphs and charts are simple to follow. I also use it to record my heart rate which I sleep. There is also an option to export the results to pdf or csv. Definitely the best free fitness apps. 🙂",
            "This appears to identical to the Acentas app, other than differences in the interface design. I liked the Acentas version, it does all I need. The biggest problem with it and this app is that it doesn't save data as you go. If the app crashes or is inadvertently closed then all data for that session is lost. To say that this is irritating after a six-hour cycle ride is to understate things. This version of the app shows a slightly lower BMP than Acentas, and is probably more accurate.",

            "Wonderful app for Zoom or Telephone Doctor appointments. I will use it for that reason. Gathering my medical data for tomorrow's visit, I find that weight and Oxygen saturation had to be written under comments. Overall, after doing patient care for 38 years, I find this app to be very thorough. Many thanks for organizing my vitals presentation.",
            "Love the simple functionality. Great way to keep track of your own vitals. I would give it a 5 star if we can track more than one person. Ideal for care givers who care for other people... like grandparents or their kids!",
            "Just the right amount of information! I wanted an app that wasn't overwhelming with graphs and charts that I don't understand and that I can email to my doctor. This app does just that! You can also write notes to yourself like... Left arm, sitting, morning, etc. Did I mention that there are NO ADS! Yes, would highly recommend this app.",
            "Simple to input and retrieve data, no ads, no frills, very quick to load and takes little memory or battery. Other than sending a text email of your readings if you choose to do so, it does not use any data. Only thing that needs improvement is the note line - it is difficult to read what has been entered sometimes. If I could request something it would be a meds field to log what taken based on readings.",

Kcal doesn't match my StairMaster, it is consistantly 20% higher, which is nice actually. Tracks weekly time, time in zone and number of workouts and saves it. I don't export stuff, but I think it can. Not sure what creator gets out of all this, maybe an evangelistic health nut?",
            "Simple interface yet very useful and satisfying user expectations. I still can't believe there's no annoying popup ads. Even this app doesn't have pro version as it's already been providing full features. I'm using myWorkouts with chest strap hr monitor. No problems with connection. Will try with gps feature soon.",
            "A high quality app that's free? Where's the catch? As far as I can tell, none! Works with my off-brand HRM. Intuitive user interface. This deserves ten stars out of five! One wish: I actually paid to get my RMR measured and I would like to be able to put it in. So unimportant but if it's an easy win, put it in the backlog! 😋",
            "Very informative and good features. It would be really nice to add a picture at the end of a workout to capture the gym equipment information.",
            "Great App. Not 100% sold on actual calories burned. My Zone and other apps say I burned more calories but I workout harder using this app because I feel this app may be more accurate."

You can record as many readings as you like, and as well as the usual systolic & diastolic you can record pulse, blood oxygen, blood glucose, and weight. There's a brilliant statistics section that gives you averages, minimum & maximum readings over a certain time period, and then some graphs which are useful as well. Excellent!",
            "Easy to use. But the field \"note\" cannot be export properly. The field was use for glucose fasting when export to csv. Suggest to add custom field for text note. And custom field (editable name) to draw trend for customizable parameters. Such as body fat etc. 20201016, Appreciated for the quick fix! This app deserves a 5 Star rating. Cheers.",
            "It's a perfect app for keeping track of blood pressure. The only issue I have is when I reboot my phone, it comes up with like 10 straight reminders to take my blood pressure. I do have reminders set for 9:45 am, 3 pm and 7 pm.",

You can also manually trigger this alert sound from your watch or on the companion app running on your phone.\r\n\r\nUsing the heart rate information is transmitted to your phone, every 5 seconds, the heartbeat sound effect is played based on the latest heart rate received. The pitch of the heart beat sound is lower for slower heart rates, and gets higher as the heart rate increases. The color of the heart rate text display varies from green to bright orange depending on the heart rate beats per minute.\r\n\r\nTo begin the Heartener session, first open Heartener on your phone. Open Heartener on your Wear OS device, and tap Activate. You'll get voice confirmation the session has begun, and within a few seconds the first heart rate data will be transmitted.

            "App shows exact measure data but it has no correction algorithms to calculate Hart rate. I got Hart rate mostly above 150bpm. It's twice as much as the true value. I switched to Samsung Health app which calculates my Hart rate correctly. By my opinion this app is useful for nerds and data analysts but not for regular users. This app has no annoying ads.",
            "This is not supported by rog phone 2. I will say that from looking at it, this app looks superb and would most likely rate five stars if I did work. The reason why is because my phone does not use Samsung hardware or software. What stinks is this app looks like it's exactly what I want. I also want to thank the developers for using either no ads or no intrusive ads.",
            "Phenomenal app. Thanks a lot to the developer for his hard work. Really detailed and polished. Uses the heart rate sensor and spo2 sensor of your phone to give detailed results about your vitals. No ads no permission except for the actual sensor in use. Bless you sir (note* app gives easy to understand outcomes in results page and uses the actual sensor than can be found in many phones-not the camera lens** i think the very latest samsung phones don't have that..so please check first.)",
            "This app brings more than I could think of as I was looking for a heart rate app that uses a Samsung Galaxy heart rate monitor instead of a camera. I also wanted to save the output, since that's impossible in the Samsung Health app. This app shows a lot more data than just the heart rate. I'm considering to get my doctor's degree to understand it all. Anyway, great app and I would be happy to contribute in some way!",
            "Wow. So much information. Make sure if your phone has a light next to camera... Use that. Not the camera to read the info. I made this mistake. It kept making me nervous because it would say that there was issues with my heart. As soon as I used the little square next to the camera everything went to normal. So after much research you're supposed to use that little square next to the camera to put your finger on. But the results are amazing. If you want more information press the top right button and click all options."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Take your bp, quickly enter your stats without having to move the cursor from box to box, and you are done. Best bp app I have found so far. You can also track weight and blood glucose. I upgraded to premium and see where a very detailed report can be emailed to my Dr or myself. It can be used with multiple users. Very impressive and useful app. Why look any further",

Only wish there was a way to save the information in case of a phone crash. Mine crashed last month and I lost all data entered before that. I haven't tried emailing the info to myself, but I will try that at the end of the month.",
            "Amazing app! No complaints! Best BP app out there in my opinion: it allows you to enter with ease lots of important data on one screen such as blood pressure, heart rate, & weight--while also allowing you to make comments and edit if necessary. A must try bp app if you don't already have it. Cheers to good health fingerprint blood pressure calculator checker blood sugar body temperature!",
            "Easy & useful I don't have an AND blood pressure monitor (not available in my country) but entering manually is one of the best I've found without any ads popping up. I've tried many and most ask for too much access (why do other's need contacts, phone and network access?) blood pressure scanner test checker fingerprint blood sugar body temperature. This little app only asks for Blutooth access if you have an AND monitor. Great to use and recommended. I give it 5 stars.",

The design is quite fluid and pleasing. It is not clutered as few apps in the same category are. The cloud feature is really helpful. If you have old data from any other app you could normalise it and import it into this app. I wish the developer updates the app and include features present in the iOS version.",
            "This app was recommended to me by my health coach, and I love it. I'm trying to keep track of my heart rate since I got sick while I'm waiting to see a specialist, and through this app I'm seeing correlations with my blood pressure and because of the notes feature, I've been able to see how one of my medications affects things. Don't know what it means, but it will be concrete data to show the doctors who often treat women differently than men when it comes to everything especially heart health.",
            "Adding the DOB in the profile is difficult. I am 49 years old and had to hit the back arrow 598 times to reach my birth month. It would also be helpfulto me to see when BP meds are taken more obviously than clicking in to each record.",

            "I regret that I had to delete this app. It just blows through my battery. It was at 65% at 1:00, by 4:15, the charge was completely drained. It has a lot of useful extras that others don't appear to have, but I was unable to figure out how to use them. I do very light weight training (I'm 74 and dealing with some challenging health issues) but I couldn't input how much they weigh and I shouldn't have to email for \"how to\" instructions for everything I want to record.",
            "The most wonderful tracking Application. But, if it became updated to the most recents as now not as the last of 2018",
            "i set this app to my step 16 inches and it became unable to keep accurate track. it is a nice app. Told me the distance while traveling from where i am to where i was going in a car. Sleep was off but relaxing or at rest was accurate. Don't know about any other things because it is hard to tell. Didnt help to make the step counter more accurate, by using their adjustment. in fact made no difference am reinstalling and will see if it works better 2nd time around. Blind in one eye, cant c out othe",
            "I really enjoy this app. It gives me helpful information about how I use my time and I don't have to remember to turn it on when I change activities. The changes I would like to see is the ability to switch from 24 hr clock to am/pm. And I wish there was some help as to how to get the most out of it. When I link to the help function I get a YouTube video on the 10 most beautiful places in the world. Nice video but not at all helpful. I really would like help on how to interpret the data it gives.",
            "I really wanted to like this app as it contains all the features I'm looking for. It's drawback lays in it's sensing of distance traveled and timing. I walk 1.2 miles every morning, which takes me 20 to 25 minutes. I clocked the distance on my car's speedometer so I know it's accurate. When I finished my walk yesterday morning, the readout of this app had registered 10 minutes travel time, and a distance of only .8 miles. Due to this inaccuracy I'm deleting the app."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I am using Polar +OH1 (arm band) and looking for a smartwatch or wearable with HR functions. I have tried fitbit charge 2 & 3, the app can't them. Do you know of any wearable devices that are working with the app?",
            "App seems to stop working intermittently. Sometimes it works for my entire run - while at other times it stops registering HR after a few minutes. It could be a problem with my \"power saving\" settings . I have an OPPO phone and the power setting are a bit confusing. I normally run a music App and then start WHATSHEART. BUt sometimes I start WHATSHEART first and then the music pp, perhaps this makes difference? I will be more consistent in future and make sure I turn the power saving service off before using this App. The current version of the App that I have does already say to turn the power saving off - but I was not sure about what to do. I like the App.",
            "Falls short as pulse monitoring for exercise. Lacked following basic features : - Heart rate zone could not be customised except setting RHR & MHR - No voice alert for change of heart rate zone, only high pulse and low pulse - Not suitable for using with strength training as without GPS distance recording calorie count is 0 - No option for editing workout record to enter and change some data - No provision for exporting data to any fitness platform.",

Options to select Strength Training Workout 3.Voice and Vibration alert for HR zone 4.Philip maffetone heart rate calculation formula ( 180 - age ) 5.Option to data export gpx i would love help test new/beta version and provide feedback",

You can share the recorded fetal heartbeat via e-mail, text message, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter. The app also visualizes the heartbeat by showing the fetal heart rate and drawing a graph that follows the fetal pulse rate.\r\n\r\nThe app allows the mother to connect with her unborn baby and enjoy a special moment with her little one from the pregnancy week 12 onwards. Even more, the app allows the father-to-be to participate in the process of the baby’s development from the early stages of the pregnancy. What a great way for the future father to create a bond with his child! Better yet, how could you in a more touching and tangible way tell the grandparents-to-be that they are going to have a new grandchild than sending them the baby’s recorded heartbeat by e-mail or as a Facebook message!\r\n\r\nHaving problems? Any suggestions? We would love to hear from you! You can reach us at support@unbornheart.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n1. Is the fetal heart rate monitor safe?\r\n\r\nFetal Doppler detects a fetal heart rate using ultrasound technology, i.e. high frequency sound waves. Fetal Doppler sold by UnbornHeart is a completely safe, CE certified and FDA cleared fetal heart rate monitor.\r\n\r\n2. How does the fetal heart rate monitor work?\r\n\r\nThe Doppler probe sends high frequency sound waves into the body and, when the position of the fetal heart reflects the ultrasound waves, the frequency of the waves is changed. Fetal Doppler receives the reflected sound waves and uses the Doppler Effect concept to calculate the change in frequency and provides an audible simulation of the heartbeat. This sound is then amplified through the headphones. Fetal Dopplers have been around for many decades, and no adverse effects have ever been reported from their use.\r\n\r\n3. What are the benefits of using the fetal heart rate monitor?\r\n\r\nOriginally, fetal heartbeat monitors were used only by medical professionals, but they have become increasingly popular for home use during pregnancy. This is because baby's heartbeat monitors can help reduce anxiety during pregnancy and offer reassurance especially during the early stages before it is even possible to feel the baby moving. Listening to a fetal heartbeat is also a great way for a father-to-be to bond with his unborn baby.\r\n\r\nExpecting a new family member is a joyous part of life but, with so many very personal feelings involved, there may be plenty of useless worry and fear. With the Fetal Doppler monitor an expectant mother can, between visits to the maternity clinic, listen to her baby's heartbeat.\r\n\r\n4. What are the benefits of using the Fetal Doppler UnbornHeart mobile app?\r\n\r\nIt brings home monitoring experience with a fetal heart rate monitor to a totally new level with new amazing features. For example, you can\r\n• Record fetal heartbeat for later playback and sharing.\r\n• Share baby's heartbeat recordings with your loved ones.\r\n• You can share heartbeats via email, text message, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.",

What are the benefits of using the fetal heart rate monitor?<br><br>Originally, fetal heartbeat monitors were used only by medical professionals, but they have become increasingly popular for home use during pregnancy. This is because baby&#39;s heartbeat monitors can help reduce anxiety during pregnancy and offer reassurance especially during the early stages before it is even possible to feel the baby moving. Listening to a fetal heartbeat is also a great way for a father-to-be to bond with his unborn baby.<br><br>Expecting a new family member is a joyous part of life but, with so many very personal feelings involved, there may be plenty of useless worry and fear. With the Fetal Doppler monitor an expectant mother can, between visits to the maternity clinic, listen to her baby&#39;s heartbeat.<br><br>4. What are the benefits of using the Fetal Doppler UnbornHeart mobile app?<br><br>It brings home monitoring experience with a fetal heart rate monitor to a totally new level with new amazing features. For example, you can<br>• Record fetal heartbeat for later playback and sharing.<br>• Share baby&#39;s heartbeat recordings with your loved ones.<br>• You can share heartbeats via email, text message, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.",

            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

After you do this, go to \"settings\" in the app. Select \"wireless\" (if using wirelessly). Then click on \"Paired Device\" & u should see your device's name appear. Select it! Should now be paired. Good Luck.. I sincerely hope this helps people experiencing problems!",

How can it use generic batteries but not use Duracell which is far better? I downloaded the app to find out it was last updated in 2016! And the Android phones which it connects to are old phones.

            "I read tarot but don't always have the cards with me. The cards are accurate in their placement and as long as the person reading has their own context clues, the reading will be quite good. And the more I use this app, the more I appreciate all its features. Try out some of these different paths. I love the different spreads and will probably add some of then to what I do now. Even the ads are not intrusive. Very manageable. I am very grateful for this app.",
            "I love it. Fun, interesting & spot on with most of it. As it goes... \"Tarot never lies\". Its amazing how accurate these are. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. Hope it works as well for others as it does me & people around me who try it from my phone. Mind blowing! Take what you read on the light side, not too serious. Its great.",
            "This app has so far been good. I don't have any problem using it every day 😅. Nevertheless, I would urge the creator to add one more special feature about moon & sun signs astrology😭, besides having the horoscope section. 😎😇 It will also better the app.",
            "That was actually spot on. I'm new to tarot but catching on quick. I have had paranormal experiences my entire life. Have seen 6 UFOs. Dreams I remember having, that give me deja vu, witch always have to do with future events in my life and are almost exactly the same. Plus I'm pretty good at predicting cards with shapes. Not sure what all that means and have been searching for answers my entire life. Tarot makes a lot of sense to me and so far it's been a positive tool in my life.",
            "First use was soooo accurate. I was able to connect with two friends spiritually and that's exactly what it read. Also, it said If I start a new business soon, I can accomplish it. Weirdd because I've been debating since last year and just these past few months about starting my own..."

            "Awesome ECG, accelerometer and RR intervals logger for the Polar H10 sensor! It works amazingly well, and continues to work even when the screen is turned off (despite my phone being stringent on energy saving and usually closing everything it can, even instant messengers!). All the data is saved in realtime during the acquisition in separate CSV files with timestamps both in the filename and per row, and are stored in a sensorDataLog folder at the root of internal memory, hence even if the acquisition is prematurely stopped or the phone shuts down during the acquisition, the data is not lost. It only needs bluetooth, so I could activate Plane mode and disable Localization to save on battery, after 1h30 of acquisition of both ECG and accelerometer it only used 1% of battery! There is just one thing that could make this app better: why not make it opensource??? It's clearly geared towards research, it would be a very welcome addition to open the source to all researchers!",

Like also the grid feature to compare blood pressure measurements! You need to get rid of the pop ups because they come on so fast you a person doesn't get a chance to read their blood pressure first after it's taken. So a person doesn't know if the app had changed the Bp measurement . You have to look twice to confirm that the app works!",

If you want a good monitor I suggest you purchase an actual device that bluetooth links and syncs with its matching app. Be sure to find one that is centered toward health monitoring and fitness. If you want reliability and quality then this app is not for you that...nor is it for you. Junk.",
            "I love this. I use it at least 4 times a day with a pressure cuff and a oximeter. It helps provide me with information and gives me something to show Doctor. It has saved my life once, and I now have a pacemaker. The app itself is easy to use. There are some issues. It is important to get the correct pressure on the camera. If you don't keep it constant, the waveform and the heartbeat won't be correct. I would like to see the final display horizontally with the graph fully expanded for detail.",
            "False results.. gives readings when your not touching camera lense. Apparently my coffee table has a heart rate.. The real time measurement takes readings regardless of what the camera sees.. carpet. TV. Toaster' this app is junk total waste of money.. so if you read this review Dev. I want my money back..",
            "Seems to work well however, It demands 5 stars to get more info. It is a useful tool.",
            "i use the app daily to help identity when my AFIB is acting like a brat. I don't consider it to be 100% accurate but does pick up when I am experiencing an elevated level. Always seek professional advice on heart issues. The app has greatly assisted me in determining when to seek out the doctor. We have used the app at the doctor's office alongside running an EKG, the results with both were reasonably similar. Doc was happy with me using app."

You can easily log your blood sugar, blood pressure, weight, medication, diet, exercise, and mood through the app.  Health2Sync provides you helpful feedback based on your blood sugar records to help you manage diabetes. \r\n\r\nKey features of Health2Sync:\r\n\r\n-- Blood sugar tracking --\r\nManually entering your blood sugar records is fast and intuitive with Health2Sync.  Along with your blood sugar readings, you can enter notes, select medication you used, food you’ve consumed, and attach photos.  Alternatively, you can also purchase the Health2Sync Smart Cable, which will allow you to upload readings in bulk from your glucometer.\r\n\r\n-- Blood pressure tracking --\r\nYou can track your blood pressure readings as well with Health2Sync.  Enter your systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings and easily see how you've been progressing with blood pressure control.\r\n\r\n-- Weight tracking --\r\nWe know how important weight control is for Type 2 Diabetes, so you can also keep track of weight changes with Health2Sync.  You can enter your weight and body fat, set goals, and easily see what progress you've made.\r\n\r\n-- Dashboard --\r\nEvery time you open the app, you will immediately see a dashboard that gives you a quick analysis of your recent blood sugar history in table and graph formats.  You can see whether your readings are in range, the movement of your readings, and you can even chart differences between your before meal and after meal readings.  \r\n\r\n-- Diary --\r\nDiary allows you to easily review your past blood sugar records.  You can quickly see what factors contributed to a high or low reading.  You can also view the diary in a table format to quickly compare before meal and after meal readings.  \r\n\r\n-- Partners --\r\nWe know having diabetes can make you feel lonely sometimes.  You can invite your loved ones to become partners with you on Health2Sync.  As your partner, not only can they stay on top of your blood sugar changes, they can also provide you warm encouragements to keep you going.\r\n\r\n-- Data Export --\r\nThe data you enter in the app can be exported as a PDF Report or Excel file.  You can e-mail this data to your doctor directly from the app, or mail it to yourself and print it out prior to your next visit.\r\n\r\n-- A1C tracking --\r\nA1C gives you a long-term indicator of blood sugar control.  You can also keep track of your A1C history and view your trends with the Health2Sync App.\r\n\r\nWe know that testing blood sugar can be painful and tiring sometimes, we really hope Health2Sync can make diabetes management more meaningful to you.

It tries to force your entries into certain time periods automatically which then requires additional work to override if you don't eat or go to bed at exactly the same time every day. This app is going downhill.",

            "This is the best app I've ever used out of any app. This app not only does as described but there's no hidden fees. It's easy to use, it keeps all info stored in a very neat manner. It also has an option to put all your inputs into charts that can be printed and/or emailed! If i could give 10 stars I would! Great app! I never leave reviews either, went out of my way for this one.",
            "Love the ability to store the info on my phone, then download it to my PC, or any of the other options this app affords, when I choose to. There's no website or online account to set up access to (AAA+ for that!). The data stays on my phone until I choose to put it somewhere else. All apps should be this user-friendly. Well done!",
            "This has been the best way for us to get my husband to keep track of his blood pressure. He showed his doctor who was impressed with the functionality of the app, especially the ability for my husband to email him the readings. As a student nurse, I have also shown this app to several of my patients who were impressed with how simple and easy to use it was. The only thing I could suggest is adding a spot to record temperature readings so all basic vital signs are recorded.",
            "Add a Temperature Field! Love this app! I never had to keep track of my blood pressure until I got very nervous and it spiked. I'm now on 2 medications & have home & work BP monitors. I used the free app, was very impressed and bought the regular app. Easy to use. The statistics are great. Writing Developers to see if they can add a temperature field.",
            "I've used this app daily for two years now and am very glad that I have. It has helped me lower my blood pressure and weight by being more aware of them. Finally paid, not so much to get rid of the irritating ads as to give credit where it is due. Early on, I found a way around the annoying ads which appear when you save a reading using the New Entry button. Otherwise I might have looked for another app. Use the History button instead and choose today's date. No ads!"

        "description": "Take regular recordings of your heart rhythm. This can identify undetected cardiac rhythm disorders - primarily atrial fibrillation - and thereby help prevent strokes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Heart Association, stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide. On the other hand, clinical studies have proven that nine out of ten strokes are preventable. The main risk factors include undetected cardiac rhythm disorders, primarily atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nPreventicus Heartbeats not only analyzes your pulse, but specifically your vital heart rhythm - simply and at any time using your smartphone camera without any accessory devices. The app is clinically validated and designed to detect irregular heartbeats (e.g. ectopic beats) and check for the presence of any absolute arrhythmia suspicious of atrial fibrillation. The app works with an accuracy nearly equivalent to that of an ECG tracing - as clinical studies have confirmed.\r\n\r\nMeasuring your heart rhythm regularly helps in prevention. Just as important as regular blood pressure measurements, Preventicus Heartbeats should therefore be your constant companion in situations occurring in life where heart rhythm disorders occur with a greater frequency and, if left undetected, can have fatal consequences in the face of risk factors like:\r\n• High blood pressure\r\n• Diabetes\r\n• Age > 55 years in combination with risk factors\r\n• Heart palpitations\r\n• Previous arrhythmia(or atrial fibrillation)\r\n• Previous heart attack\r\n• Previous stroke\r\n• Menopause\r\n\r\nPreventicus Heartbeats lets you visualize your heart rhythm by recording it on a PDF report.

        "descriptionHTML": "Take regular recordings of your heart rhythm. This can identify undetected cardiac rhythm disorders - primarily atrial fibrillation - and thereby help prevent strokes.<br><br>According to the American Heart Association, stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide. On the other hand, clinical studies have proven that nine out of ten strokes are preventable. The main risk factors include undetected cardiac rhythm disorders, primarily atrial fibrillation.<br><br>Preventicus Heartbeats not only analyzes your pulse, but specifically your vital heart rhythm - simply and at any time using your smartphone camera without any accessory devices. The app is clinically validated and designed to detect irregular heartbeats (e.g. ectopic beats) and check for the presence of any absolute arrhythmia suspicious of atrial fibrillation. The app works with an accuracy nearly equivalent to that of an ECG tracing - as clinical studies have confirmed.<br><br>Measuring your heart rhythm regularly helps in prevention. Just as important as regular blood pressure measurements, Preventicus Heartbeats should therefore be your constant companion in situations occurring in life where heart rhythm disorders occur with a greater frequency and, if left undetected, can have fatal consequences in the face of risk factors like:<br>• High blood pressure<br>• Diabetes<br>• Age &gt; 55 years in combination with risk factors<br>• Heart palpitations<br>• Previous arrhythmia(or atrial fibrillation)<br>• Previous heart attack<br>• Previous stroke<br>• Menopause<br><br>Preventicus Heartbeats lets you visualize your heart rhythm by recording it on a PDF report.

        "title": "Healthzilla: Heart Rate Monitor & HRV Stress Test",
        "description": "Hi, I'm Zilla. Your fiery friend for a better, longer life. We're building your one app for Healthy Habits. Use the app to measure your Heart Rate and HRV, track your Stress & Recovery, and build Healthy Habits like Intermittent Fasting, Breathing Exercise, and Mindfulness Meditation.\r\n\r\nCAMERA HEART RATE MONITOR, NO WEARABLE NEEDED!\r\nHealthzilla can now monitor your Resting Heart Rate (\"RHR\") and Heart Rate Variability (\"HRV\") using your phone's camera. It takes just 60 seconds, and will measure your RHR (heart health) and HRV (stress & recovery) just like a wearable device. Do the Stress Scan every morning before getting out of bed for best results!\r\n\r\nNEW: 16-HOUR INTERMITTENT FASTING TIMER\r\nThe latest health & fitness trend is Intermittent Fasting. Use our free fasting timer to fit the ideal 16:8 fast into your day. We'll notify you once you can eat again! If you forget to set the timer in the evening, you can edit the start time to capture your fast.\r\n\r\nNEW: 10-MINUTE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TIMER\r\nThe easiest way to fit some mindfulness meditation into your day is to use our unguided meditation timer, with beautiful Tibetan gongs to help you stay focused on your meditation.\r\n\r\nNEW: 2-MINUTE RELAXING BREATHING EXERCISE\r\nIf you're feeling anxious or stressed out, take just two minutes to try our Breathing Exercise. The 1:2 ratio of inhale to exhale will activate your parasympathetic nervous system to calm you down instantly!\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR STRESS & RECOVERY TRENDS\r\nThe dashboard shows a weekly chart of your Heart Rate and HRV data. If your Heart Rate is HIGHER than normal, it may be an indicator of higher physiological or psychological stress. Similarly, if your HRV is much lower than normal, it will indicate higher stress levels. You can use this information to guide your recovery from workouts, and generally planning your daily activities at work. For active recovery, you can also focus on sleep or add meditation and breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nDAILY STRESS SCORE\r\nAfter each Stress Scan, we calculate your Stress Score based on recent trends: Great, Good, Easy, Rest, or Sick. Use this as a guide for your daily wellness routines, activities, and workouts.\r\n\r\nANOMALY DETECTION\r\nTo help you make sense of this data, our Stress Score algorithm checks for unusually high or low values for your heart rate. Very low HRV or very high Heart Rate can be signs of acute stress, injury, or illness.\r\n\r\nFEELING UNWELL?\r\nYou can now manually override your daily Stress Score, if you're feeling stressed or unwell. You can access the override from the dashboard, or after your daily Stress Scan.\r\n\r\nRESTING HEART RATE (“RHR”)\r\nThis data is much more important than your real-time heart rate. What’s the difference? Heart Rate represents how much work your heart has to do when you’re relaxed. It’s not exactly the same as the lowest heart rate you have when you sleep.\r\n\r\nThe reason resting heart rate is important is that it’s a rough measure of your nervous system activity, hormone levels, and cardiovascular fitness. There is research to show that lower resting heart rate means longer life.\r\n\r\nHEART RATE VARIABILITY (“HRV”)\r\nOkay, so we know heart rate is your pulse. How many times the heart beats per minute. So what is this voodoo, then? Well, it turns out that the beats per minute aren’t steady. There’s a minute variation between each one. Some shorter, some longer.\r\n\r\nThis is some of the most interesting new data out there, because HRV is actually a representation of your central nervous system. If you’re not exactly sure what that is, it’s basically your wiring. How signals pass between your brain and the rest of your body. Analyzing this signal indicates if your body is in fight or flight mode, or rest and digest mode. Naturally, you wouldn’t want to unnecessarily be in fight mode which stresses out your body over time.\r\n\r\nRead our full terms of service: \r\nhttps://healthzilla.ai/terms",

So, I decide that today I want to go that side or in this area with the help of map. But, over all this is a good app. For army training and fitness lovers.",
            "I turned on the app, and it started tracking my progress. I locked my phone, and turned on the lock screen - the app was still running. So far so good! Midway through my run, I unlocked my phone and saw that THE APP HAD CLOSED ITSELF AND HAD COMPLETELY ERASED MY PROGRESS! This happened twice, and it's absolutely unforgiveable!",
            "Good basic timer and if you pay the $0.99 you can customize your running times. I use it for interval running and it works great. Listen to music and a little chime tells me when I reach each time point.",
            "Simple and very useful. No ads is a relief from all the other apps. Suggestions: 1. The map feature in history is a bit difficult to navigate. It zooms but doesn't pan. Also it doesn't show a colour scale corresponding to speed (or whatever quantity it shows). Having the option to plot different variables would be a great plus. 2. Having alarm intervals based on distance instead of time would be awesome!",
            "Very good app to workout with and accurate in distance timing. The only thing I see on it is that you can't share your workout with other athletes. I suggest it to have a share icon."

The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation.",

            "I use this all the time to find out the bpm of songs whenever I make mashups and stuff. It works great!",
            "Perfect! I just need a tool to check the BPM of some tracks I'm mixing. This works great.",
            "As usual, it works for everybody else, doesn't work for me.. play a song, tap it once and nothing happens, tap it a few time, it throws out random numbers.. either way, I can't figure out the tempo of a song with it..",
            "It works really well! @davethedj change the settings so that the tap is measuring to unlimited or 20 taps instead of 1 or 2 taps. It will take the average over all the taps and will give you a accurate bpm! Thanks a lot for this app! And please make a pro version without advertisements. I would pay for that. And maybe instead of taking an average over all the taps it would be nice if it would take out the extremes in the calculation so that if you would make a mistake it wouldn't matter. Thanks!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Then, when it did finally get a 72 BPM, when the save screen came up it just kept flashing I had to shut off my phone to get it to close the junk app. Don't waste your time with this app, it's probably for the sole purpose of data mining since you have to all the app to access contacts, camera, photos, all the stuff this app DOES NOT NEED. I have begun not allowing apps that do nothing, but want full access to your personal data. Other than this app being totally useless, it works fine, for mining your personal information and the information of anyone in your contact list, not to mention this app wanting access to your pictures. Don't waste your time, with this junk app, it does not work. In fact, I've just uninstalled this useless data mining app.",

            "Great app! I've used several diabetes trackers and this is the best, for average use. It allows you to track the important stuff your doctors ask for and provides exports of data, but it's simple to use and not too complicated to set up. I paid the $1.99 U.S. to upgrade to the Pro version with no ads. It's well worth that fee. ***IDEA FOR THE DEVELOPER*** I like the Measured drop list where I can select a description for each blood test, such as \"fasting\" or \"after breakfast.\" Would you mind expanding that just a little to match what doctors in the U.S. ask for? Here's what I'm thinking: (1) CHANGE the three existing \"Before\" meal options to say \"Immediately before.\" Example: \"Before breakfast\" would become \"Immediately before breakfast.\" (2) ADD three meal options that begin with \"2 hours before.\" Example: \"2 hours before breakfast.\" ***MORE IDEAS FOR DEVELOPER:*** (3) Allow me to set an automatic recurring backup to a cloud drive location of my choice, such as a Google Drive folder. (4) Provide the option of a web interface with quick data entry and data exports. I work on a computer all day so it would be faster for me to type my data into a bookmarked browser page than use my phone. I would only use my phone when I'm away from my computer. (5) You could add some \"about this app\" info inside the app. It might include the official name of the app, links to a web interface, company info, company email, developer info, links to review the app on Play Store, etc. Thanks for considering my ideas and thanks for making a great, stable app that is easy to use and understand!",
            "Great app. Easy to use for recording blood sugar and blood pressure levels and the report feature allows you to easily share your data with your doctor. The ads can be annoying, but for a free app that works well that is only a minor issue.",
            "Looks pretty good. Only thing I would suggest for an upgrade. With the blood pressure it is set on the right arm and it is necessary to change it every time for my left arm. It would be good if there was something in settings to be able to set it to the left arm permanently. Not only for us right-handed people. The bloke at the chemist where I bought my blood pressure device said that it is better to use the left arm. Something to do with the circulatory system.",
            "Excellent app. It helps remind me to watch what I eat. I can see the cause and effect of my choices. So this hells me stay on track. I love the \"Statistics\" data and the fact I can express the data to PDF for my doctor. I highly recommend this app 👍",
            "Great application. Just one thing is missing that there should be combined report chart of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight."

            "Excellent idea and well working, but has some important minus that totally prevent its usage:  1) the zone is only settable trough sliders. That means that if you want to set a tight zone (e.g. 160-175) the two points will be so close that it will be impossible to set them properly   2) it's not possible to set alarm while training. A simply on/off button is missing, featuring the whole application useless! When you start running you do not reach your zone (e.g. 160-175) in less than 10 minutes and then you leave the application off. Once you reach your zone you do not want to stop running and set the application, it makes no sense. Simply, a \"on/off\" button is lacking, making useless everything.  It's a pity because it could be a great tool for everybody, but not usable at all yet.",
            "It is so close to be 5stars but it only \"almost \" works. Sensor keeps saying is disconnected. A known working one. If only it was reliable be great. But it isn't.",
            "the app is a bit clunky, but it's the only one I can find that connects with Polar H10 that audibly alerts the wearer when heart rate is outside the defined zone. Setting the zone (min and max) could be made more simple. I gave it 4 stars because it did what I wanted which was to alert me if my heart rate went above a maximum rate during training. The alarm continues ringing until heart rate drops below the users preset maximum. OVERALL: Good app, but could be better. 👍",
            "the ONLY app I've found that does what I want: simply alert me if I'm above/below an adjustable target heart rate zone. Is it perfect? No, but it does the basic thing I want that even very complicated paid apps don't. IF YOU ARE GETTING CONSTANT BEEPING/ALERTS, TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS FOR THE APP (in the pull down app panel, press-hold the notification, then turn off notifications.). You'll still get beeps/alerts when out of range, but not constantly."

This also counts for multiple speakers which should be doing the same (a cluster of multiple subwoofers for instance).\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n - Red is NOT bad!! A lot of filter-designs that drive loudspeakers have out of polarity components (so for instance the high frequency speaker CAN be opposite polarity to the low frequency speaker).\r\n - Try to measure as close to the speaker as possible (and away from bass-ports).\r\n - dBFS means \"Decibels relative to full scale\". So 0dBFS is the maximum soundpressure your device is capable of handling without distorting (clipping).\r\n - Using a different pulse signal CAN give opposite readings, due to loudspeaker filter designs.

        "description": "Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\r\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\nhttp://twilight.urbandroid.org/doc/\r\n\r\nGet more from Twilight\r\n1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading.

It allows me to play my games or read my online books to try to relax when in the midst of a migraine. Definitely the first thing I install on a new phone! Thank you so much for creating this!",
            "The first time I installed the app, I didn't understand how to manage the settings and I rushed and uninstall it. It's after some months I took out my time to carefully go through it and realized that it is one of the best screen filtering apps. I salute the developers of this app and wish you more wisdom to create more better apps for the world.",
            "Wonderful app. Easy to use. Great for those of us who get up for 30 min in middle of night before going back to sleep. Sure beats staring at ceiling for hours. The relaxing red dust storm tone is peaceful when you inevitably check your phone. Also great for going to bed as you set dimmer and brighter times. Also great for whatever went beep in the night on your phone that you don't get hit with the searchlight that iluminates your skull till your ears glow.",
            "This actually helped me go to sleep ! Im shook! My problem is...first off theres settings that im totally not comftable with nor understand. Also the whole time i was using it.. I was getting warnings of battery being used way to much & it was! Also it was using my data! To much of it! Im gonna try a different one. 😔",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years. I really like it for using my phone in the evening, and I have a small child who's often up in the night and so it's great to have the settings for nighttime use when I'm up with her. Very customisable. Highly recommend."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

Urgently sort this out or I will have to consider return.",

The thought is that if rescuers can remember one thing in crisis mode it would be most beneficial if it was good compressions and timing. For more advanced CPR providers, and/or rescues where more than one person is on scene who is a trained first responder, rescue breathes between compressions is preferable. It would be good to have a preference setting for either style.",

It doesn't prompt breaths after the cpr cycle, it just continues to the next cpr cycle. It should either talk and say ventilate, ventilate at an appropriate pace, then continue; or stop and allow you to resume manually. It doesn't allow either.",

            "Highly recommended for any bluetooth enabled chest strap heart monitor wearer looking to focus solely on training zones during exercise.  It is a minimalist app which is exactly what I was looking for.  A large section of the display is dedicated to the BPM reading, with color coding for the personalized zone - perfect.  Easily visible without reading glasses while on a cardio machine in the morning.  Exactly what I was looking for.  This app does one thing and does it very well.  No unnecessary integrations, complications or distractions.  Just real time feedback during exercise.  Thanks Acentas for making this free to the Android community.",
            "Heart Rate Monitoring is satisfactory but it is unusable with workout. Lacks following basic provisions :  - Resting Heart Rate input - Weight tracking - Calorie counting - Record editing (for inserting type of workout, distance etc) - Audio cue for heart rate zone change and min, max heart rate - Capability to watch historical data inside app - Export of data to external fitness platform. At present it is just an academic project w/o any real life use.",
            "Nice app, simple and does well the job, to be perfect for me i would add a real time hr on the notification Android bar, to not be obligated to unlock phone to see the actual rate. Another useful functionality would be something that sounds or vibrates if you are out of a zone, would be useful if i want to train on a specific zone",
            "Super simple to use, no payment required. It gives you heart rate zones based on your profile but you can also personalise. You can record the activity and it will give the percentage that you spent in each heart zone. Everything I was looking for. 😁",
            "Good app. But it needs notifications for heart rate intervals. So you can hear when you are going up or down your desired heart rate interval while training."

The eSense Skin Response to measure electro dermal activity or galvanic skin response (EDA, GSR).\r\n\r\nThe Mindfield eSense Skin Response is a small sensor to measure your skin conductance using the microphone input of your smartphone or tablet.\r\nYour skin conductance depends on your state of relaxation or stress and is consequently a commonly used and precise stress indicator. \r\nWith the eSense Skin Response, you can precisely identify your stress level and reduce it with biofeedback training. \r\nThis app includes a comprehensive manual for training and many training possibilities.\r\n\r\n2. The eSense Temperature:\r\n\r\nThe eSense Temperature is a small sensor for measuring your skin temperature with the microphone input of your smartphone or tablet.\r\nHand warming training is an especially effective and common biofeedback method. The temperature of our hands is connected to our stress level: \r\nWhen we are stressed, we tend to have cold hands. Immediate feedback enables you to voluntarily increase the skin temperature in your fingers, \r\nthus, increasing your peripheral blood circulation, leading to relaxation and stress reduction.\r\n\r\n3. The eSense Pulse:\r\n\r\nThe Mindfield eSense Pulse is a precise 1-channel ECG chest belt sensor to measure your heart rate variability with your Android smartphone or tablet.\r\nThe connection is made via Bluetooth.

I tried different apps like UA Record, they have more functional UI but are not compatible or unstable,basically not usable. This app finds the Bose heartrate quickly, and I almost never lose heartrate connection during the workout. Simple, works consistently, accurate, and uploads to Google fit every time. Recommended."

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

            "Terrible at counting the number of steps I take. Records between 50%-90% of the steps that Google fit records, which is impressive; seeing as the app is supposed to sync with Google fit, I'm not sure why it would have a different record. Feels much less accurate than any other pedometer I've used. I do like the achievements and levels offered, but they're pretty pointless if the number of steps in taking isn't recorded accurately.",
            "I really enjoy this app I've been using it for around a year maybe more now and I have had no problems with it. It counts my steps fairly accuratly I would say and has features where you can log the amount of watter you drink each day as well as other lings like weight loss tracking and if you pay for it you can get workout plans and other stuff (I don't but its an option if you are interested). Also it gives little celebrations when you meet your goal which is fun.",
            "It's a cute app. I love how it encourages you with confetti when you reach half way. A lot of people have the Fitbit but frankly I can't afford one. I'm a broke college student and covid has me up to 200lbs. I need to shape up and this is free and from what I can tell so far there aren't many ads.",
            "I really enjoy the app, but there is one thing bothering me. I have my phone with me when walking the dog and have reached the highest level (Lvl. 9) within only a few months. I really wish the leveling system would be extended by a few awards, say 1M steps, 3M and so on and so forth. I've only been using the app for less than 10 months and have already went ca. 1,6M steps",
            "Mega Excellent app!!!!! I just need some functions in this app: 1) Can you make this app useful for some kids. 2) Make this app in maps like taking distance from a school to a garden like make a way from one place to another. 3) Set a setting like measuring room, going up a down by stairs or slopes by telling the app. So these a are my several updates for this app please update app including these functions. Please please please please please. 😅😆😢"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "It's great when you wanna know how much calories this exercise makes you burn but it doesn't really help if you actually wanna lose weight or have a balanced diet! Because we are human we need to eat and this app doesn't keep track of that, so unless you already have a diet plan AND you wanna do the math like hmm my meal had this much calories and I burned this much then I don't think it helps with a diet and exercise it just tells you how much calories you burn with a serten exercise.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "So far, i found this app astonishingly beautiful.i helped me read so many books. I highly appreciate what developers are doing to make this app more and more beautiful. I cordially want to thank the develpers for this outstanding app. i never find such app which has this many customizable options/setting to make soothing experience to read and listen to the texts. Thanks!",
            "I wanted to give it 5 stars, because the reading voice is almost as fluent and natural as in an audiobook. There was until now only one pdf (old scan) which @Voice failed to convert. Especially Bahá'í terminology and Arabic / Persian names are pronounced well with English text. Unfortunately this needs work in the German voice. I haven't found an option to \"train\" it. I have recommended this App to a number of contacts, which I hardly ever do. In short I am impressed by @Voice. 👍",
            "Incredibly useful. Lets me read scholarly articles while driving and walking the dog. But it has been inconsistently remembering where I left off on an article when I close it and return to it later. About half the time, I have to scroll down to search for where I left off. Still leagues beyond other TTS readers though. Update: The developer quickly responded to my email about this issue and said they fixed it, which will go out in the 22.1.6 release. Thank you, I'm very excited for this fix!",
            "This app does what the developer promises. I wanted a way to quickly review my own drafts and listen to other people's writings while I exercise and do stuff in the workshop. IDK about you guys, but I find I can think clearly when I am working with my hands or just moving around in some way. Even though I love reading, I find it tough to move or work with a book or device blocking my view. This app saves me time and allows me to move as I 'read'. It does the trick. I bought the no ads upgrade.",
            "Could easily be 5 stars but it will not read the next chapter in a book no matter how long I wait, with or without Internet on it just freezes on the next chapter and refuses to keep reading. I have to pick up the phone, manually click out of the app and back in and click a million times even with \"start talking at once\" ticked on. I'd like to upgrade to premium, but this non-functional free version is giving me pause. Why pay for an app that can't prove it works?"

I adore the detailed audio when incoming zombies or distant gunfire sound as if they're truly getting closer with your pace. \"Letters\" will also be e-mailed to you as you journey through this story. The free version is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy this a couple times a week, since it takes a few days to unlock each episode. Whereas subscription is worth it when you're looking to progress almost daily like myself. I love it!",
            "My favorite running app but... I like it for the entertainment. While the app is much less glitchy for legacy users than before, the distance is way off. I can walk slowly and it will say that I have done a mile every 6 minutes, when I have walked maybe half a mile or less. However, I do love the incentive to run when I have the Zombie chases on, it gets me going and has helped to make much progress.",
            "I love Zombies! Run!! I started running from zombies with the Abel gang in 2018, and never stopped. I only got 2 episodes into Season 1 before I started my subscription, and it has been worth every penny! This is the ONLY app that I cannot think of one single critical comment about. The stories are interesting, the actors are extremely talented, and if the need to find out \"what happened next\" doesn't get you moving, nothing will. Thank you, Six to Start!",
            "I just love this app, it got me running outside for the first time and made me want to go just to hear the next episode! The storyline is great, the app is easy to use and when the zombies chase you, you can't help but sprint 🤣🤣 Wonderful concept and so glad I found it! The other areas of the app like the 5/10/20km running plans are valuable and building up my base is a fun twist too. I recommend this app to everyone, its honestly the greatest motivator!",
            "So I have tried this on 3 different phones and had the same issue. Audio works for about 10 mins and then app goes silent. Have tried with / without music, internal and external player...no luck. As for not looking at app once started...need to remove that statement. Also, no headset start stop. No doubt the OS will be blamed, so uninstalled cause probably no resolve."

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. 😎 This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "Looks like a fun game, but there's no way to skip the introductory levels. Meaning if you already know anything about rhythm, you'd still have to go through multiple beginner levels before unlocking anything that would remotely challenge you. As such, I'd recommend this app for total beginners only and nobody else. It's unfortunate the game is designed in a limited way (it would be as simple as letting users choose a difficulty level in the beginning)",
            "The use of this app will improve your time. It teaches you to listen and respond to the metronome in your head. It shows you the nuances of the result of each response. You learn relaxation, accuracy and confidence. It is progressivly challenging. Each level must be executed correctly before continuing to the next level. However, each level may be repeated as much as desired in order to increase and solidify mastery. This app functions as a personal trainer for the improvement of your timing.",
            "This may be by far the best experience I have ever had when coming to learn something new. Absolutely incredible the way it's broken down for you. The fact that they count with you and the clever trick they have implemented with the arrows it awesome. It' an unbelievable experience and highly recommended if you're someone like me who has never had any music experience. I feel like I'm actually learning something and I'm excited to see if it will apply to dance.",
            "I enjoyed the content I got to play, but I was disappointed it was only 12 levels long before I had to buy more content. I was considering sharing this with my elementary students as well. Unfortunately, when I completed the last level, the text included the word \"ass.\" I don't feel comfortable sharing this with my students now.",
            "Pretty good. improvements i would like to see would he a different sound for the first beat, and the abikity to skip forward so that exercises can be unlocked. I do like that the prompt says rhythm is a journey. However I'd like to use this with some of my students who could easily skip ahead to eighth or sixteenth notes and dont want to waste their time on the early stuff. Perhaps if there were an assessment e.g. it will unlock sixteenths if you can pass an 8th note exam."

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."
