            "Used on S10+. The flash light became so hot it started hurting my finger. I turned on the flash without the app and it was fine. I think it increases the intensity of the light to max and it gets scorching hot. Did not have this problem when I used it in my S8+.",
            "I cannt even finish test because of very high temperature of camera light. Almost burned my finger. Om Samsung 10s.sorry something wrong with your software. And dangerous.",
            "Latest update causing weird issues. Needs fixing.",
            "I used to rate this app a 5star, but then they got rid of continuous monitoring and anytime my finger moved a bit I had to start it up again. I use this app to help with my anxiety, but now these ads pop up and I have to wait before I can use it again. Absolutely the worst thing to happen during a panic attack! So sadly, after many years of use, I'm going to have to uninstall and find an alternative.",
            "this app I've got to say is pretty accurate.. the reason I say that is because I have a medical device that check's your heart rate and oxygen level..now and then I check my heart rate with my cell phone with the heart rate app and compare this app showing my heart rate with my medical device,,which goes over your index finger and there is only 1 or 2 point difference everytime that's pretty good. works good but don't substitute this app from anything you might be using now tommy g So,Cal,"

            "Quite good but I'm not sure about the accuracy. I use it to record my pulse after exercise but it takes about half the scanning time to settle down and then I see it reducing until it's finished the scan. The final scan value is the one that's recorded so I suppose I need a fitness watch if I want a more accurate reading straight after exercise.",
            "So far so good. I had one descrepencie out of 10. The reading was off. My accuracy is important. I hit my highest weight ever at 330 - 5' 10.5°. I'm on a Pro-Form Stepper and it is amazing the results in 15 minute workouts. So today was my first to complete 15 min 6 1/5 laps without a pause. Walking to my bed edge and measure my rate. 128 bpm. My resting is 61 avg. So I'm trusting my health these numbers are accurate. My wife readings are higher which is also accurate.",
            "After the latest update, I'm always on 56, no matter if I'm running, laying, sitting. Just doesn't matter. I want the previous version back !!",
            "Close but not 100%. I work in Healthcare and have access to multiple devices. Direct comparisons and this is usually within 3-10%. Works fine for monitoring when I'm not at work.",
            "Overall it's quite helpful, with some occasional inconsistency. Measurements are a tad low, but close enough for a quick calculation to get the real reading."

            "IMO this app is head and shoulders above the rest in this category. It is extremely simple to use, very accurate and records and stores results, giving me something very meaningful to show my cardiologist. One addition I'd like to see is a small text field to allow a recording to be annotated with activity information to add important context.",
            "This app has picked up on irregularities well. And is accurate in detecting rate. But I really wish there was a way to make a note to say what was going on when I used it at that particular time. Something other than \"resting\", \"warm up\" etc. Sometimes I get palpitations and will check my rate. Would be nice to be able to add a note like \"palpitations while cooking dinner\". Then I can fill my doctor in when I see him next.",
            "Best! Ive used many... I suffer from mental and physical health issues. When my anxiety shoots up, I have to do breathing exercises, and I have to monitor my heart rate. So I know what, and when things are happ. This app really is incredible that works immidiate, and you can print/Share out your own cardiograph!!! That is huge for me I mean huge! You can go back to different dates, whatever you want to do if you're looking for something to monitor your heart rate I absolutely recommend this!",
            "clean and simple. this type of app measure bpm by colour change noted by camera. you can see how fast your heart beat by covering camera with finger and make sure flashlight on and light goes throught finger. open video camera with flashlight on. you will see slightly color change on screen with heartbeats!",

If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of the type of experiment wherein sound is reproduced by analyzing the vibrations of a bag of potato chips through a window in a silent video; that's basically why I accept that this app can work, and work well. It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",
            "Great app. I actually compared its Heart Rate results with a expensive BP Monitor that I have, and I was surprised to see that the Heart Rate reading was very close to the one my expensive BP monitor gave me. I recommend this app. It's a very handy thing to have on your phone when your away from home and can't take your reading with your regular medical monitor.",
            "I have a issue that specialists and doctors are finding hard to workout. This app just showed it occurring. So it does catch what heart is doing. Its not meant to diagnois but atleast you can save it and take to a professional for assessment.",
            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

            "For the most part, I think it's a good app. I think it needs to be easier to update that you have participated that day. Currently, the only way I have been able to reach that is by entering the app, viewing the web page, logging into HQ, editing the profile and then from there going to the events page. There has got to be a easier and less time consuming route to do that. Additionally, selecting that you have participated should be based on the calendar day (date) instead of on a 24 hour cycle.",
            "It may be convenient if you are trying to easily raise money, but honestly the website works well enough for that. My issue with the app is that they get the kids all excited about making their stickers and heart heroes come to life with the augmented reality part of the app. Then it turns out that not all phones are compatible with that feature. I downloaded the app last year because she was desperate to use that feature. It worked last year. Now this year it says my device (same phone) is not compatible. Not all of us get new phones every year or 2. It really shouldn't be so complicated that a 2 year old phone can't work with the feature.",
            "Agree with the others saying the camera won't work for the arcade. Keeps saying my phone is not compatible. It's frustrating that my kids can't complete the Finn Challenge because we don't own an iphone. I know that education and raising money is the main goal here, but let's face it, earning those prizes in the process is everything to 5-7 year olds! Please fix this!",
            "Love the app. Makes things very easy. Have been trying for 3 days to scan the heart healthy logo and it will not do anything. I've clicked on the blue and black camera and I've turned the phone parallel as other reviews recommended nothing has worked. It's all my daughter has left to earn Finn."

            "I have been playing this game for 40yrs, long before it was a computer game, with real cards and players. Never lost so much, almost every hand I take the queen of spades. It seems as though I am playing against the pack and not the players. E.g lay a 3 of diamonds and suddenly only one player has diamonds and lays the 2, I get the queen spades . If I go for a full house with only 1 or 2 high hearts the next player will have an ace and take it first time hearts are out ,then play to my hand?",
            "So not sure if I'm the only one that has this problem, BUT every few games the ads in between games are like zoomed in to where I cant press the 'X' or 'Close' and then have to get booted from the game because I can't get back to it. It's fine with the single player game as I can just close the game and come back. But thats not possible with online play.",
            "Too many ads, too many opportunities for opponents to slow down and ruin a game. Some ads still have close button in top left corner which don't work and cause me to get booted. There needs to be a TIMER on each player's turn. A visible, 10 second count down and if they don't play a card one is automatically played or they get booted. It sucks that half the games people either quit or get salty and just take 20 seconds every turn until I quit and then get banned for quitting. Good game otherwise",
            "Very good version of Hearts. You can play against real people or against AIs. Games finish at 50 points, so most rounds go quickly. What I don't like: a lot of people quit part way through the round when things aren't going their way and you have to wait for their turn to time out. Also, there are a few \"comments\" you can make during your round (good luck, nice one, etc) that some people annoyingly misuse. I wish there was an option to block certain players to limit interaction with these folks.",
            "Game may be good, but it forced me to watch 8+ ads just to play ONE FREAKING GAME of soltaire Hearts. I understand they need to make $, but this is ridiculous!! Every single hand, another ad. Wanna go back to main menu after a game? Guess what?? YEP!!! ANOTHER ad. You honestly spend more time watching ads then playing the actual game! Only way to get rid of ads is to pay $20. Sorry, but my experience after just one game was so overwhelmingly ad focused, i just couldn't take it anymore!"

            "This is the worst app ever, every game is rigged by admin, dealer, and if you say this, admin says it Is a random deal , generated by the computer, not possible, I got to four crowns, twice, and every non passing hand I got, queen and eight of spades, not very likely In five consecutive days of playing!!! They warn everyone not to mention USA politics or get a ban,, I am not in America, didnt mention it and have been banned for 2 days!! Idiots! ,!!",
            "Too much cheating Have someone in charge of the table Let them boot the cheater off Do not let partners play together If you stop.the cheaters You will have a better.game",
            "It's decent but easy to beat as it's predictable. I played over 2k games, set at 21 hands, and won 84% of them also getting 42% of \"shoot the moon\" hands. The game mostly throws under and sometimes holds higher cards to stop StMs. Still though it's pretty fun. And no, I never once used the \"Undo used\" feature except hitting it accidentally trying to use the \"Eye\" icon to view previous trick.",
            "Full screen ads appearing after completing game are now unable to stop before a prescribed amount of time or unless you exit the hearts app. These animated ads (which further drain battery) were tolerable when you could simply press the back button and return to the hearts app to start a new game. Now, the back button is disabled, even preventing you from returning to another application or homepage, again, unless you close app completely. The enjoyment of the game has been greatly diminished.",
            "Basically this isn't a real hearts game. Reason being the creators of the game made a point system for some idiotic reason. So instead of going for low man like you would normally do people play for 2nd place since you still get positive points. Why they thought that would be a good idea is beyond me. So you can get 5 crowns and never come in first place. And get rid of the button that lets you look at previous cards played. It takes skill to actually count cards and know what's still out there."

            "This version of the game of Hearts is perhaps, the worst at cheating thay I have ever played. To start with I am dealt the 2 of clubs 9 out of 10 deals. Constantly dealt the 5 of hearts and invariably other three players have the 2, 3 and 4 of hearts. Plus, I constantly receive the A & K of hearts in the pass. These events happen far to often to be mere chance. These problems did not manifest themselves until after I won the vast majority of the games I played.",
            "Excellent game, however, im experiencing two issues. 1. Since the recent update Sometimes I cant use the backward button on my phone when an advertisement pops up. 2. You have ads larger than the screen that there is no way to close the advert window so i have no choice but to exit the game. These two issues have created frustration. Otherwise, its a brilliant (program) game.",
            "This is the very BEST Hearts Card app I've ever played! Relaxing times & it's fun. I have used other apps for this game which were bad ones! In other words, it felt like there was lots of cheating going on! This 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Classic Hearts Card Game is Great! The reason I've uninstalled it a few times is because every now & then, it was time to post another card before the game was over ~ but that was impossible ~ all my cards had already been used...must've been a bug hack....Has this been fixed?",
            "Games great, no sound and fair. With the ads, you now are forced to let them play through, can't close and we go from silent game to screaming ads every after every hand you play. So completely muting , is working. But you used to be able to at least skip some ads. Not the case now. Many of the other games we play , at least allow for a few hands between the next ad. Sure wish you would play for 30 minutes to check it out for yourself ,to mute, does not let me hear sound notifications.",
            "I'd buy it to get rid of the ads. I've been playing Hearts 50+ years, the developers need to tweak the algorithm, Isabella shouldn't play the Ace of Spades in front of me unless she knows she can shot the moon. 90% of the time she has other spades to play, I bomb her with the B and then play another spade to check, sure enough, she has other spades to play, bad move, I'm just saying!!!"

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2. When you refresh your discover page it really does nothing but give you the same feed just with 3 or 4 new pictures at the top. I'm pretty sure you're not having a shortage of pictures or something so please improve upon this. 3. The watermark thing has to go. Period. Y'all wildin.",
            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures 😢"

Try to have rMSSD greater than 40ms, track your progress in app history graph.<br>HRV graphs show changes in pulse. <br>Poincaré Plot shows changes in successive heart beats, good dispersion is over the main diagonal.<br><br>Spectral analysis<br>Shows the balance in ANS (Autonomic Nervous System). <br>LF/HF is one of nervous balance indicators (low stress) and good values are close to 1. <br>For reliable results duration should be 2min+.<br><br>Cardio<br>Get benefits from Cardio using zones calculation and instructions in the app.<br><br>Analysis duration<br>In general, longer analysis provides more reliable results.<br> * 10-15 seconds is sufficient for Heart Rate<br> * 30 seconds analysis provides HRV measurements<br> * One minute analysis provides more reliable HRV measurements<br> * Two+ minutes analysis is necessary for reliable spectral analysis<br><br>ECG for Everybody<br>ECG provides more accurate results, check ECG for Everybody: Mobile, complete, Heart health check solution which transforms smartphone to the ECG station, provides fitness, heart health analysis and connection with others through sharing and crowdsourcing http://ecg4everybody.com. Our tests show that PPG based heartbeat detection may have less than 2% error in comparison with ECG based detection. <br><br>ECG for Everybody http://ecg4everybody.com is in early stage and we are open for comments, critiques, advice, cooperation. <br>Our Mobile ECG sensing extender is ready for pre-orders. It is an unoque mobile ECG sensing solution which can operate without electrodes and capture up to six ECG channels with dozen lower manufacturing price design.<br>Get familiar and with additional solutions like ECG generator which is mobile app with peace of gear which transforms mob app generated signal to the real ECG which can be captured using any real ECG device, including our. stevan@ecg4everybody.com<br><br>It&#39;s good to have flash close to the camera to provide lights through finger, otherwise try to provide good light conditions.<br><br>This is not a medical app.",

Measurements are super inconsistent often leaving several hours or even days long gaps in the log, which I find strange because I can sometimes see my watch's green monitoring light activating on my wrist but no actual reading will be recorded what so ever. It is a shame because the app itself is really great packed with a lot of features, all of which free of charge!",

With 24h tracking with 10 mins sample interval. My watch battery down to 20-30% at the end of the day. Then I switch to this app, and using a watch face that allow me to config widget.

The app is not sending the BP information to google fit, making it worthless, I might as well use my old BP monitor and manually enter the information. 3. Most other apps get the health data (including my doctor) from Google Fit, hence, if these guys don't push the data, then they are of no use for me.",
            "Horrible app. Keeps crashing. Can't find any doctors if you use the VA. gave up trying to use the Bluetooth. With all the problems that it has I definitely don't trust its security of my medical data.",
            "STILL waiting. Will this update fix something? Doesn't: work offline, doesn't detect BT 50% of time. Early: Much lame. Very trouble. Not impressed so far. This app needs work. * The app does not CORRECTLY read the sensors on Android device. - It repeatedly asks me to turn Bluetooth on (it's already on). - It complains about GPS not being on *when it's already ON*. * There is _NO NEED for GPS_ for this app. It reads a BP cuff, it doesn't need GPS! *Bluetooth does NOT need GPS to function!*",
            "It's just okay. The monitor loses sync with app in phone all the time and diffucult to sync back. Also app also freezes and wont open at all.",
            "App doesn't sync with Castlight after last update. Pointless to take measurements with a Bluetooth device if you can't earn points for taking the time out of your day to measure."

I rarely can't win one set by not doing this at all unless I change one of AI characters to extremely easy/kid mode. And even with uninstalling & reinstalling the app...it often gets way worse!",
            "The game itself is great. Unfortunately spoiled by adds that run for 30 sec's that can't be turned off. I appreciate I am using the free version and therefore have to accept adds, but most other apps allow you to hit an X to end the add if it is not appropriate to you. Shame.",
            "Addictive, but the game does cheat, regardless of the dev responses. At the hardest difficulty, once you hit a good winning run, you'll start getting impossible hands. Don't let it frustrate- it's rigged.",
            "Plays nice. Can be as easy or challenging as you like just by choosing the strength of the opponents. I am using about the cheapest android mobile you can get and have had no problems.",
            "It's ok but the ads sometimes crash the game for me or get in the way, and when playing the game it feels like the other three characters are against you rather than being fair and impartial, which would make the game more enjoyable imo. Overall it's not too bad though when you're in the mood for the game, and the animated avatars are cool."

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

            "It kept saying it didn't detect anything no matter what I did. When it finally worked it said 40 bpm, not true. I didn't really like it. Just my opinion though.",
            "Used once and then it told me i had to purchase! Not free!!! Worked great when i did use it. It has weekly purchase options available, but i dont recall anything about a price being added after i downloaded it. Very unhappy about that.",
            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",
            "You have to provide a basic version for free . If it works useful way can go for premium version. I have seen very different heart ratings in 3 days ..Felt it is not working properly.. just uninstalling now",
            "this is the best Heart rate app I've seen in a long time. No bloat, continous measuring, a graph background to measure intensity, can toggle flash on or off and syncs with Google fit. Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away. It would be better if an audio beep was added for the heart rate but this is really good"

            "The game is fun and all that but the tutorial hand is like in the way if you know what your doing an die lewels are to easy i would say maby making the lewels more challenging and open more department becouse i playd like 10 min and i was done with both departments and why the extra patient's if all of the is the same its kinda pointless cause its playing the same level over and over but besides all that the game is fun.",

            "Way more adverts than in their other games, one between every deal. Only saving grace in not stupid length ones. Graphics and style of gameplay didn't really work for me. Shame as enjoy all other games of theirs I play. The best online version played was the old Yahoo one back around the xp days, would be a very good model to aim for.",
            "I'm giving this game 5 stars because it is what it is. Yes there are ads a lot of ads but you get to ask them out pretty fast in other words you don't have to wait 30 seconds to watch a crummy boring uninteresting ad which is good. The game itself is pretty simplex the graphics are plane but the gameplay is very very fast paced which I like. You get rewards here and there and you're playing against a lot of bots but they don't try to hide the fact. So to the Developers good job",
            "I think it's rigged in one person's favor. Fix it or I quit. I won't play with snake until you quit giving him all good cards.ok now thanks. Why do you always have one that hardly takes any tricks. Can't be random .makes the game suck. Now mr spaceman hardly takes any pts. Cut it out! Can't be random. I won't finish game that has one player way ahead every time same one",
            "This is better than the other Hearts game I've played. However, occasionally I'm given credit for taking the Queen of Spades when I actually didn't. Also, I do feel I'm ganged up on, ie. three players (the computer) all-in-one playing to make it impossible to win. But I still am addicted to this game. After all, someone has to lose! Thanks for a great passtime.",
            "Taught me how to play and now lots of fun and have started playing online. Only downside is there's no options for no ads. Would be nice to have the option of a one off fee if you prefer of £1-£2 like other games."

            "Inaccurate. Gave it 2 stars because I like the idea of the app, but the heart rate was consistently 10-20 bpm above my Garmin heart rate monitor (which is trusted) and the actual pulse in my wrist - way off. The app consistently told me I have an arrhythmia, but said the same for everyone who tried it - including my red sofa cushion which is apparently also bradycardic lol. I'm sure I was on the camera lens well, and remained very still. If you download this app, don't take it too seriously.",

            "This is honestly the first game I've ever completed, usually I get incredibly bored with them because of how repetitive they are, that I just give up half way through, but not this one. The controls are easy, and each level is different from the last, using logic to solve them. It only took about three days of straight playing to complete, but honestly I would play it all over again if I could! 10/10",
            "Great! Ads kept ruining the mood and slowed down my gameplay which sucks because I was becoming so addicted so quickly until the ads broke the mood and on occasion crashed the game. I feel like you can use the ads for a reward system for example you could watch an ad to gain point to unlock skins in a store or add different modes but i recomend you guys just keep the ads out of the main game in general but other than that this game is so cute and extremely fun for everyone!!",
            "So adorable and precious. The mini story and cuteness was the best part. The controls worked well, but could be tweaked further, and the gameplay was fun and satisfying, but I felt it could have been more creative; the mechanic and idea was great, but something more than spikes and falling to avoid would have been nice. There were lots of ads, but they were spaced out well enough that it wasn't too bad, and most ads were appropriate (except the \"Choices\" game ad popping up). All in all, good!",
            "Finished the game and loved it! It was super cute and the characters were just adorable! The levels got difficult but still not impossible! Learned about it through my younger sibling and he likes it as well! Great game!!",
            "Don't get me wrong this game is amazing. The problem is its difficulty. There are some already hard levels with difficult-to-pull-off-puzzles which you have to complete TWICE IN A ROW. Now okay it's a late game level but still it gave me a impression of a tricky puzzle game. ( which it is except for some levels ) but the late game delivers me an ordinary platformer game experience which is bad in my opinion. So, if you are new to plaformers it may be a little to hard for you."

            "Some of the reviews here really display the immaturity and spoiled attitude of mobile gamers. It's so unreal that you'd uninstall and complain about $2 to support a dev who made such an amazing game and even let's you try before you buy. I used to play this game for hours on end and it got me through 2 deployments. Not sure if the dev's are still updating as I got a warning that the game was built for an older version of android, but everything still works fine.",
            "Having only played the first 3 floors/levels, I cant help but wonder how this game has gone so unnoticed. A simple, yet detailed and deep dungeon crawler, especially in regards to character customization. In short, this reminds me of the original Diablo in its simplistic and welcoming approach to the hack and slash genre. Thankfully, there are no corny or retro / pixel graphics. Finally, a simple yet addicting hack and slash that tries to be challenging and (most of all) fun. No p2p, so far.",

            "I tried a different app first and paid to get a chart facility to discover that if there is a temporary disconnect with the chest strap the app had to be restarted. Then I found this app. Charting is free. And it reconnects. It does the job. My only gripe is that it hides the files it creates. It uploads from the app but it would be nicer to use a sync program I use for other files.",
            "The readings are inaccurate. By a wide margin. Max heart rate on a garmin watch using the polar h10 and an oura ring was 79. This app said 125. Graphing could be better. Being able to zoom would be good. When I try to load an overnight dataset the app crashes.",
            "Excellent and simple to use app. I use it with my scosche rhythm plus and it works perfectly. The graphs and charts are simple to follow. I also use it to record my heart rate which I sleep. There is also an option to export the results to pdf or csv. Definitely the best free fitness apps. 🙂",
            "This appears to identical to the Acentas app, other than differences in the interface design. I liked the Acentas version, it does all I need. The biggest problem with it and this app is that it doesn't save data as you go. If the app crashes or is inadvertently closed then all data for that session is lost. To say that this is irritating after a six-hour cycle ride is to understate things. This version of the app shows a slightly lower BMP than Acentas, and is probably more accurate.",
            "Simple. Connects all the time. Could use for sleep, all day long, whatever. Just a continuos running graph, which the fancier apps don't do. Nice."

Kcal doesn't match my StairMaster, it is consistantly 20% higher, which is nice actually. Tracks weekly time, time in zone and number of workouts and saves it. I don't export stuff, but I think it can. Not sure what creator gets out of all this, maybe an evangelistic health nut?",
            "Simple interface yet very useful and satisfying user expectations. I still can't believe there's no annoying popup ads. Even this app doesn't have pro version as it's already been providing full features. I'm using myWorkouts with chest strap hr monitor. No problems with connection. Will try with gps feature soon.",
            "A high quality app that's free? Where's the catch? As far as I can tell, none! Works with my off-brand HRM. Intuitive user interface. This deserves ten stars out of five! One wish: I actually paid to get my RMR measured and I would like to be able to put it in. So unimportant but if it's an easy win, put it in the backlog! 😋",
            "Very informative and good features. It would be really nice to add a picture at the end of a workout to capture the gym equipment information.",

            "This initially looked good. It saw my monitor and gives a simple clear display. I paid for the chart upgrade. Except there does not seem to a way of permanently linking a device. Every time the app starts it has to ask what device to connect to. More annoying is that if it temporarily loses contact it won't automatically reconnect.",
            "Works very well with my cheapo chest strap monitor. Nice big readout, with BPM and current exercise zone. Just remember to switch on Bluetooth first, otherwise it hunts down every enabled device in the street (TVs, laptops, tablets, phones ...). If you want to log your workouts you need to register and pay, but I can live with that",
            "Exactly what I was looking for. The free version includes heart rate range alarms that you can customize. It works with my Bluetooth chest HRM from Decathlon. Perfect for MAF training.",
            "So far so good. Easy straight forward way to link chest strap with Android and get heart rate without hassle",
            "Holy cow! I can't believe the app has finally been updated. It's been pretty annoying having to export my workout file manually each time after the app would force stop and close. But I'm here to say it actually exported my workout straight to Dropbox like it used to years ago. I nearly left this app a few weeks ago, after years of use... Actually I tried others, but none of them could quite do everything I needed from them like this one can. So glad I stuck with BLE Heart Rate Monitor!"

            "Update: 10/27/2020. Again...took out batteries and put them back in. The bp monitor immediately synced with the app! Yay! (Previous review: Working well until few days ago. Now app will not synchronize (sync) Android phone with the Equate bp device. Uninstalled app and re-installed to see if it improved connectivity and still will not connect.)",
            "Does not sync properly. I was able to sync readings ONE TIME and have not been able to get it to sync at all since then. This defeats the whole purpose of my purchase in the first place and I will be returning the BP device, since there are better ones out there with apps that actually work.",
            "I just got this machine/app and so far it's very easy to use and understand. I only need to take my blood pressure once daily. I can set reminders on the app. This machine/app also uses two people, so my husband can use it too.",
            "I really like my blood pressure monitor. I use it every day. And I can show my readings to my doctor with my phone. And I keep track of my husbands as well. I would recomend this monitor to anyone. I love it.",
            "Download the app to my phone which is an expensive up-to-date Android and could not get the Bluetooth to connect to the device. I had to manually input each number and the graph only shows a couple of days."

        "description": "Turn your smartphone into your personal Heart Rate Monitor!\r\n\r\nHeart rate or heartbeat is an important measure of health and fitness. Using the Heart Rate Monitor app, you can now measure and monitor your heart rate! And also use it for optimizing your exercise and to track your progress.\r\n\r\nWhy is this the best heart rate monitor app?\r\n✓ Incredibly accurate in measuring your heartbeat. \r\n✓ Free with unlimited heart rate measurements. \r\n✓ Multiple user profiles. Track the heart health of your family members in a single app. \r\n✓ Save and share your heartbeat graphs with your health care provider. \r\n✓ Enhanced by Health Infinity insights.\r\n✓ Connect to Google Fit.\r\n✓ Backup your measurements securely.\r\n\r\nHow to use the Heart Rate Monitor free app to measure heartbeat?\r\n★ Place and lightly hold your index finger against the back camera lens and flashlight.\r\n★ It uses your phones built-in camera to track color changes on the fingertip that are directly linked to your pulse. \r\n★ Do not press too hard, otherwise, blood circulation will be altered and the results could be affected.\r\n★ Remain calm and try not to move too much during the measurement, as this can compromise measurement accuracy.\r\n★ Do not measure with cold fingers when the blood circulation is poor.\r\n\r\nIs it accurate?\r\nHeart Rate Monitor is highly accurate as it uses the same technique that medical pulse oximeters use. It does not need any external hardware. \r\nThe app then uses our Award winning Heartbeat Fusion algorithm used by Health Infinity for detecting the heart rate accurately. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Normal Heart Rate?\r\nA normal heartbeat for adults ranges from 60to 100 beats per minute (BPM). However, keep in mind that many factors can influence it, including Activity level, Fitness level, Body size, Stress, Emotion, Cardiovascular health, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat is a Resting Heart Rate?\r\nYour resting heart rate gives you a view of your heart's fitness. It varies depending on your age and training level. A very fit and athletic person has a lower resting HR than someone who is less active. Eager to know if your fitness level has improved? Measure your heartbeat on a regular basis and monitor the progress of your resting heart rate. \r\n\r\nFitness Usage:\r\nIt is also very suitable for people who would like to measure their workout intensity e.g Running, Gym or any kind of training. It is perfect for High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) or Cardio.\r\n\r\nMultiple User Profiles:\r\nYou can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them can have their own individual measurement history.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well-lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\r\n- This application should not be used as a medical device.\r\n\r\nFor Health App Developers:\r\nUse our framework to add Heart Rate measurements to your app. Contact us for documentation and sample code. \r\n\r\nProduct Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heart-rate-monitor\r\n\r\nMade with ♥ by Droid Infinity!",

            "The bots are terrible at the game. I have played weak players before but they aren't as bad as these bots. A lot of their plays make zero sense. It's not a challenge when bots lead with QOS notwithstanding they have plenty of lower spades and they are not trying to STM. I guess they have to basically let people win many times to keep them into the game and watching those ads. Which there are a lot of. Graphics are good. Fun to play but soon gets ruined when the bot doesn't play to win.",

I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items!

            "Scanner takes 3 minutes and if it thinks your finger moved at all it restart. It can be very frustrating and obviously a probability towards the accuracy of the final scan. I'm still sticking with it I'm going to give it a 30-day trial I'm halfway through that. I find it useful but I do think that you should be able to add more tags.",
            "This is a good app. I compared the results using Samsung Health stress meter ( I use a Note phone which has a heart rate monitor), and they were fairly accurate. Even the heart rate was accurate to the beat if 2-3 beats per minute. I tested in resting conditions, after exercise, ( where the HRV is minimal, so stress is maximum) and Samsung Health stress results and this app results match perfectly.",
            "This app's heart rate is pretty accurate, but the stress level is just useless. Even if I measure in the middle of a severe panic attack, it says I have low stress. Half the app is in English, half is some Asian language. Not recommended for stress measurement",
            "The ability to use camera for heart rate is very innovative. The app checks the variance of the heart rate from the median and has some predefined set of calculations to get the percentage. This may not be accurate way to calculate mental stress, but the condition of the heart. However, the bpm shown is perfect. So 4 stars, but 1 star less because the stress percentage is not always accurate. It shows different values when taken one after another for me.",
            "This is a must have app. It helps you to monitor your stress levels! The monthly calendar is great so you can see how well you are doing at managing your stress. High recommend!"

            "App used to work amazing. Now after the latest update it no longer allows me to use the app to begin a blood pressure ready. I have to manually enter the BP reading after I initiate it on the cuff itself. So much for ease of use Bluetooth. Not the most efficient. Most times I can't get the app to load fast enough to record the readings. So I have to start a whole new reading.. Then I can record it.",
            "Terrible app! Extremely unresponsive to touch input (i.e., it takes 10-20 attempts at tapping/swiping to get anything on the screen to respond), there is no way to see a list of all the readings that have been taken (you have to TRY to swipe through the list of readings at the top), and it simply WILL NOT share the results to any external source. The \"Share\" button is as unresponsive as the \"close door\" button on an elevator. This horrible app renders a very overpriced BP cuff nearly useless!",
            "This app is highly unreliable. Won't start the device (take a measurement) half the time and over a week ago just stopped working completely. Won't pair to device or take measurement now. Tried all the basic troubleshooting methods...none worked. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app...now trying to get it to pair and re-establish my user account. Very frustrating.",
            "This app worked intialy, then the glucoose feature stoped working quickly followed by the BP feature, it no longer update my BP readings to the app, defeating it purpose. Waste of Mony if the app doesn't work.",
            "It works like it is supposed to once you get your phone to identify it by Bluetooth. The app. has all these instructions telling you the hard way to do things. The easy way is simply to drag the screen down like you do on any other app. to update info and it will upload all your BP pressure info and tabulate it on an ongoing basis. As for the hard way, that works too, but it's like all things that use Bluetooth it can be slow and sometimes not respond. The simple way avoids all that, just drag the screen down and forget the rest."

            "App shows exact measure data but it has no correction algorithms to calculate Hart rate. I got Hart rate mostly above 150bpm. It's twice as much as the true value. I switched to Samsung Health app which calculates my Hart rate correctly. By my opinion this app is useful for nerds and data analysts but not for regular users. This app has no annoying ads.",
            "This is not supported by rog phone 2. I will say that from looking at it, this app looks superb and would most likely rate five stars if I did work. The reason why is because my phone does not use Samsung hardware or software. What stinks is this app looks like it's exactly what I want. I also want to thank the developers for using either no ads or no intrusive ads.",
            "Phenomenal app. Thanks a lot to the developer for his hard work. Really detailed and polished. Uses the heart rate sensor and spo2 sensor of your phone to give detailed results about your vitals. No ads no permission except for the actual sensor in use. Bless you sir (note* app gives easy to understand outcomes in results page and uses the actual sensor than can be found in many phones-not the camera lens** i think the very latest samsung phones don't have that..so please check first.)",
            "This app brings more than I could think of as I was looking for a heart rate app that uses a Samsung Galaxy heart rate monitor instead of a camera. I also wanted to save the output, since that's impossible in the Samsung Health app. This app shows a lot more data than just the heart rate. I'm considering to get my doctor's degree to understand it all. Anyway, great app and I would be happy to contribute in some way!",
            "Wow. So much information. Make sure if your phone has a light next to camera... Use that. Not the camera to read the info. I made this mistake. It kept making me nervous because it would say that there was issues with my heart. As soon as I used the little square next to the camera everything went to normal. So after much research you're supposed to use that little square next to the camera to put your finger on. But the results are amazing. If you want more information press the top right button and click all options."

Then, when it did finally get a 72 BPM, when the save screen came up it just kept flashing I had to shut off my phone to get it to close the junk app. Don't waste your time with this app, it's probably for the sole purpose of data mining since you have to all the app to access contacts, camera, photos, all the stuff this app DOES NOT NEED. I have begun not allowing apps that do nothing, but want full access to your personal data. Other than this app being totally useless, it works fine, for mining your personal information and the information of anyone in your contact list, not to mention this app wanting access to your pictures. Don't waste your time, with this junk app, it does not work. In fact, I've just uninstalled this useless data mining app.",

            "I find this, in conjunction with the Polar OH-1 the best combination to track my fitness and workouts. Easy to share information. I had a minor glitch with it not syncing with a pair of Samsung devices. I notified the debug/development team and they jumped on it and resolved the issue with an update within 4 working days. superb customer service and top notch app. Highly recommended. I have been using it daily for 10 months now.",
            "I want to get this but won't spend $20 until Android features are updated. The look and UI are excellent, but compared to the iOS version, it lacks features such as calendar, insights and details. Not to mention the integration with third party services is meh. Haven't seen major upgrades since I looked at it a year ago. When they arrive, I'll subscribe.",
            "Since I'm paying for this it would be great to be able to customize my workout list on my galaxy active 2. I've used this app on my apple watch when I had an iphone and LOVED it. Hate to see that I don't get all the same features, but still paying the same price. Thanks for the quick response from the developer! It has been so long since I had my apple watch I thought it was the same price. My bad! Can't wait for future updates 😬👍🏻",
            "It's pretty good...Galaxy 3 Watch, Google Pixel 3XL. No, it's not as immediately synched or as just plain constant as Samsung health, but it's got some cool metrics, and a great display. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. It's good tech.",

With all of the information about heart disease on both TV and the Internet, do you really know which information is advice that you can trust on heart disease? How about information that is not accurate on heart disease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many different kinds of “heart disease” and we will briefly touch on those in this article, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you ready to learn more about what heart disease is and the different types of heart disease? Good, then keep reading!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is heart disease? The latest definition of heart disease is any disease that affects how the heart normally works. Narrowing or hardening of the arteries that lead to the heart is the most common type of cardiac disease, today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course this can encompass quite a few types or variations of heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of heart disease include:\r\n\r\n* Alcoholic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Aortic regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Aortic stenosis\r\n\r\n* Arrhythmias\r\n\r\n* Cardiogenic shock\r\n\r\n* Congenital heart disease\r\n\r\n* Coronary artery disease (CAD)\r\n\r\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Endocarditis\r\n\r\n* Heart attack (myocardial infarction)\r\n\r\n* Heart failure\r\n\r\n* Heart tumor\r\n\r\n* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Idiopathic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Acute mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Chronic mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Mitral stenosis\r\n\r\n* Mitral valve prolapse\r\n\r\n* Peripartum cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Pulmonary stenosis\r\n\r\n* Stable angina\r\n\r\n* Unstable angina\r\n\r\n* Tricuspid regurgitation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are many categories of what actually constitutes heart disease. Now that we have identified different types of cardiac disease, let’s explore some of the underlying causes of these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses Of Heart Disease\r\n\r\nJust as many different names for cardiac disease can be confusing and complicated, so can the causes of heart disease. And we will cover the most common causes below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly, here are some causes:\r\n\r\n* Hypertension (“high blood pressure”)\r\n\r\n* Heart valves that do not function normally\r\n\r\n* Electrical conduction of the heart that causes an abnormal rhythm.\r\n\r\n* Heart’s pumping function that is affected by toxins or infections.\r\n\r\n* Congenital or “birth defects” of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many People Are Affected By Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, there are approximately 70.1 million people affected by some type of cardiac disorder! Heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death in the US.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong minorities, cardiac disease or heart disease, ranks first as leading cause of death. The rates of deaths declined for those groups with the exception of one group, American Indian females. The time frame for this study was between 1985 and 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween 1992 and 2002, the percentage of decline of death rates for CHD (Cardiac Heart Diseas) was the highest among white males and the least decline was in the black female population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Impact Of Cardiac Heart Disease\r\n\r\nBesides the horrific costs of CHD in terms of personal tragedy, society also bears the brunt of the effects of this disease. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the study, 2005 costs for CVD(Cardiovascular Disease) were staggering. Overall, costing 393 Billion Dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCosts broke down like this:\r\n\r\n* 242 Billion Dollars for direct health care costs.\r\n\r\n* 35 Billion Dollars for indirect costs of morbidity.\r\n\r\n* 117 Billion Dollars in DIRECT costs of mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, cardiovascular disease is one that while complicated and intricate in name and causes, is simply devastating to both the individual and to the society that the affected comes from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be taken very seriously and not ignored, so education and prevention are essential in decreasing the effects of these diseases, commonly know as cardiac disease.",

I couldn't find any other android-to-cheststrap app that creates a real time heart rate graph like this. Perfect for my sessions at the heart wellness center. l hope that I can figure out how to save a recording of completed sessions. Does it do that? I am using a Wahoo chest strap. P.S. My Android is not supposed to be ANT+ compliant, but mysteriously, I get an ANT+ signal.",

This app is fairly accurate and has most features in the free version. Also it promises no ads even in the free version. Also biggest advantage is it can integrate with Google fit. Only time will tell if the accuracy is consistent and I would certainly pay for pro version.",

I couldn't even get this app to take my heart rate correctly, it couldn't pick up the rate. I didn't get it once after multiple tries. My finger was starting to get hot trying to get it to pick up, finally just gave up and uninstalled.",

Maybe it doesn't happen to other people, but it does to me, maybe it's a glitch or something. But other than that- it's so cool! I'm rating it 5 stars for sure. My teacher in the morning, she opens the app and shows it to the students. We travel many cool places! So I searched for this and now I'm truly addicted. Best earth 🌎 globe ever!",
            "The app is easy to use , the map is accurate too but my complaint only is the maps and street view is very old . The street that i always passing through as of now there's a gasoline station there but in the map of google and street view the location is still in grassy area. It seams that this map is from 2015 or less i guess. Please update the map because everything is changing and needs an update of it thanks.",
            "Very out dated, My apartments have been here for almost 3 years and its still showing as woodlands when I put in my home location. I've noticed it on a lot of other things too buildings that are no longer there new buildings that have replaced them it is completely outdated and if Google maps has updated all these things I don't understand why why Google Earth has not updated these things. Other than that the graphics are great so my only complaint would be YOU NEED TO UPDATE!",
            "I love your app google and it would be good if you could update your images but I don't think you have to like all the other reviews say. I understand if you can't because you will have to code sooooo much again just to update the pics. I understand as I am myself a coder. Thank you so much google 💓.",
            "Good app..Just my location is so outdated...it shows what my area in West Kentucky looked like 9, I said 9 YEARS old..as much money and tech that google has, seems they would update the \"Flagship\" of satellite apps.. And as far as the graphics that everyone is bosting over..they look like a 7 yr old used water colors..Sorry google,...but have to be honest..Doubt you will respond to this just like you don't respond to any comments..My location is West Kentucky....Please Update.

The only thing doctors seem interested in is treating the symptom itself. Asking them to find the cause of the problem will quickly turn them into huffy puffy babies. This is my experience. Conventional medicine has failed me. At this point, I'm having better luck with my own ventures on the internet. I would love to see statistics on self diagnosis vs. using the medical community. I'd be willing to bet that when it comes to figuring out the root cause of an illness, the statistics between the two would be dead even. LOL! \"Dead\" even! I amuse myself! Conventional medicine IS a joke!",

            "Gameplay is good, but you would have to already know the rules of hearts, which seem a little different from what I know. Please add some sort of rule book. My main criticism is that you cannot tell which settings are \"extra\" and cost money to use. Take the gameplay speed feature, the slowest and fastest speeds are the same; you can change the setting, but it does not affect performance. Note that money spent is actually to purchase a different app, as opposed to an in app purchase",
            "This could be a GREAT game if it were not contrived. Just finished a game, and the player to my left, had NO CLUBS, at the break, sluffed. After herts were broken. Player to my right, had no heats, until the last 2-3 cards were left; then magically he had hearts! Cannot tolerate this typ e of cards. Was my FAVORITE game.. Was. Betty",
            "OK, not the slick graphics of others, but the play mechanics are excellent, better than any other hearts game I've tried. Shooting the moon, takes real skill here. If you are a serious hearts player, this one is good for testing / building skills. Ad-free is awesome. Sometimes the cards passed don't make sense, but that happens often to with real players. Real players often make emotional choices, that you don't see here - if thats my criticism, take it as a clue to how well this plays!",

If you want a good monitor I suggest you purchase an actual device that bluetooth links and syncs with its matching app. Be sure to find one that is centered toward health monitoring and fitness. If you want reliability and quality then this app is not for you that...nor is it for you. Junk.",
            "I love this. I use it at least 4 times a day with a pressure cuff and a oximeter. It helps provide me with information and gives me something to show Doctor. It has saved my life once, and I now have a pacemaker. The app itself is easy to use. There are some issues. It is important to get the correct pressure on the camera. If you don't keep it constant, the waveform and the heartbeat won't be correct. I would like to see the final display horizontally with the graph fully expanded for detail.",
            "False results.. gives readings when your not touching camera lense. Apparently my coffee table has a heart rate.. The real time measurement takes readings regardless of what the camera sees.. carpet. TV. Toaster' this app is junk total waste of money.. so if you read this review Dev. I want my money back..",
            "Seems to work well however, It demands 5 stars to get more info. It is a useful tool.",
            "i use the app daily to help identity when my AFIB is acting like a brat. I don't consider it to be 100% accurate but does pick up when I am experiencing an elevated level. Always seek professional advice on heart issues. The app has greatly assisted me in determining when to seek out the doctor. We have used the app at the doctor's office alongside running an EKG, the results with both were reasonably similar. Doc was happy with me using app."

        "description": "The app is used together with the fetal heart rate monitor sold by UnbornHeart.\r\n\r\nShare the joy of expecting a baby with your loved ones! \r\n• Record fetal heart sounds for later playback. \r\n• Share fetal heartbeat recordings with your family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UnbornHeart app makes listening to your baby's heartbeat an entertaining and social experience by providing a way to record the fetal heart sounds and to share them with your family and friends. You can share the recorded fetal heartbeat via e-mail, text message, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter. The app also visualizes the heartbeat by showing the fetal heart rate and drawing a graph that follows the fetal pulse rate.\r\n\r\nThe app allows the mother to connect with her unborn baby and enjoy a special moment with her little one from the pregnancy week 12 onwards. Even more, the app allows the father-to-be to participate in the process of the baby’s development from the early stages of the pregnancy. What a great way for the future father to create a bond with his child! Better yet, how could you in a more touching and tangible way tell the grandparents-to-be that they are going to have a new grandchild than sending them the baby’s recorded heartbeat by e-mail or as a Facebook message!\r\n\r\nHaving problems? Any suggestions? We would love to hear from you! You can reach us at support@unbornheart.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n1. Is the fetal heart rate monitor safe?\r\n\r\nFetal Doppler detects a fetal heart rate using ultrasound technology, i.e. high frequency sound waves. Fetal Doppler sold by UnbornHeart is a completely safe, CE certified and FDA cleared fetal heart rate monitor.\r\n\r\n2. How does the fetal heart rate monitor work?\r\n\r\nThe Doppler probe sends high frequency sound waves into the body and, when the position of the fetal heart reflects the ultrasound waves, the frequency of the waves is changed. Fetal Doppler receives the reflected sound waves and uses the Doppler Effect concept to calculate the change in frequency and provides an audible simulation of the heartbeat. This sound is then amplified through the headphones. Fetal Dopplers have been around for many decades, and no adverse effects have ever been reported from their use.\r\n\r\n3. What are the benefits of using the fetal heart rate monitor?\r\n\r\nOriginally, fetal heartbeat monitors were used only by medical professionals, but they have become increasingly popular for home use during pregnancy. This is because baby's heartbeat monitors can help reduce anxiety during pregnancy and offer reassurance especially during the early stages before it is even possible to feel the baby moving. Listening to a fetal heartbeat is also a great way for a father-to-be to bond with his unborn baby.\r\n\r\nExpecting a new family member is a joyous part of life but, with so many very personal feelings involved, there may be plenty of useless worry and fear. With the Fetal Doppler monitor an expectant mother can, between visits to the maternity clinic, listen to her baby's heartbeat.\r\n\r\n4. What are the benefits of using the Fetal Doppler UnbornHeart mobile app?\r\n\r\nIt brings home monitoring experience with a fetal heart rate monitor to a totally new level with new amazing features. For example, you can\r\n• Record fetal heartbeat for later playback and sharing.\r\n• Share baby's heartbeat recordings with your loved ones.\r\n• You can share heartbeats via email, text message, Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.",

It lets expecting moms to listen to the fetal heartbeat sound and record their own heartbeat to soothe their crying babies after they are born.\r\n\r\nThe pregnancy period is the most happy time of the life. During this period, expecting moms, on the one hand, take care of their unborn babies while on the other hand, prepare for the birth of their babies. Listening to their babies' heart can strength the emotional connections, record the most precious moments, and share with their friends and families.\r\n\r\nBabyStemo mainly has three functions:\r\n\r\n1. Listen to, record, save and share the fetal heartbeat sound.\r\n\r\n2. Record the heartbeats of the moms and playback them to their babies after they are born to soothe them when they cry. Babies get very familiar with their moms' heartbeat (most part of the womb sounds) when they are still in the womb and continue enjoying these sounds after the birth.\r\n\r\n3. Listening to the babies' heartbeat during their growth is also some kind of care and emotional connection.\r\n\r\nCompared with a fetal Doppler, Stemoscope has two differences.\r\n\r\n1. Stemoscope does not use ultrasound to detect the fetal heartbeat, so this avoid potential harm induced by the incorrect use of ultrasound. Fetal Doppler use ultrasound to detect heartbeat. Ultrasound can heart the tissue of the body. Inappropriate use of a fetal Doppler may result in harm to the baby. In 2014, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) even issued a safety warning on the use of Fetal Doppler at home. Stemoscope listens to the sounds passively and is more suitable to listen to the fetal heart at home, especially for recreations.\r\n\r\n2.

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

The types of puzzles can test many problem-solving skills including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, spatial recognition, and word completion. games focus on logical and conceptual challenges. While many action games and adventure games include puzzle elements in level design, it is a true puzzle game focuses on puzzle solving as its primary gameplay activity. Great animation and music plus it has a dark storyline.",

No matter what, I get queen of spades, whether I'm dealt it or passed it. Tricks taken away too quickly. Would be helpful if the players names stayed with the same strength. How can Ethan lose with over 100? And then he wins with a negative score of -45 with same players next game?",

An intriguing storyline, a different mythology based on an ancient Indus civilisation, and innovative puzzles make this game a cut above the rest. Have some snacks on hand, because you will want to play this one straight through. As a hardened game player, I didn't expect the few 'tugs at the heartstrings' I encountered. Lots of 'extras' including an excellent comic book which explains the events leading up to where it was supposed to be.",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

        "description": "Hi, I'm Zilla. Your fiery friend for a better, longer life. We're building your one app for Healthy Habits. Use the app to measure your Heart Rate and HRV, track your Stress & Recovery, and build Healthy Habits like Intermittent Fasting, Breathing Exercise, and Mindfulness Meditation.\r\n\r\nCAMERA HEART RATE MONITOR, NO WEARABLE NEEDED!\r\nHealthzilla can now monitor your Resting Heart Rate (\"RHR\") and Heart Rate Variability (\"HRV\") using your phone's camera. It takes just 60 seconds, and will measure your RHR (heart health) and HRV (stress & recovery) just like a wearable device. Do the Stress Scan every morning before getting out of bed for best results!\r\n\r\nNEW: 16-HOUR INTERMITTENT FASTING TIMER\r\nThe latest health & fitness trend is Intermittent Fasting. Use our free fasting timer to fit the ideal 16:8 fast into your day. We'll notify you once you can eat again! If you forget to set the timer in the evening, you can edit the start time to capture your fast.\r\n\r\nNEW: 10-MINUTE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TIMER\r\nThe easiest way to fit some mindfulness meditation into your day is to use our unguided meditation timer, with beautiful Tibetan gongs to help you stay focused on your meditation.\r\n\r\nNEW: 2-MINUTE RELAXING BREATHING EXERCISE\r\nIf you're feeling anxious or stressed out, take just two minutes to try our Breathing Exercise. The 1:2 ratio of inhale to exhale will activate your parasympathetic nervous system to calm you down instantly!\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR STRESS & RECOVERY TRENDS\r\nThe dashboard shows a weekly chart of your Heart Rate and HRV data. If your Heart Rate is HIGHER than normal, it may be an indicator of higher physiological or psychological stress. Similarly, if your HRV is much lower than normal, it will indicate higher stress levels. You can use this information to guide your recovery from workouts, and generally planning your daily activities at work. For active recovery, you can also focus on sleep or add meditation and breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nDAILY STRESS SCORE\r\nAfter each Stress Scan, we calculate your Stress Score based on recent trends: Great, Good, Easy, Rest, or Sick. Use this as a guide for your daily wellness routines, activities, and workouts.\r\n\r\nANOMALY DETECTION\r\nTo help you make sense of this data, our Stress Score algorithm checks for unusually high or low values for your heart rate. Very low HRV or very high Heart Rate can be signs of acute stress, injury, or illness.\r\n\r\nFEELING UNWELL?\r\nYou can now manually override your daily Stress Score, if you're feeling stressed or unwell. You can access the override from the dashboard, or after your daily Stress Scan.\r\n\r\nRESTING HEART RATE (“RHR”)\r\nThis data is much more important than your real-time heart rate. What’s the difference? Heart Rate represents how much work your heart has to do when you’re relaxed. It’s not exactly the same as the lowest heart rate you have when you sleep.\r\n\r\nThe reason resting heart rate is important is that it’s a rough measure of your nervous system activity, hormone levels, and cardiovascular fitness. There is research to show that lower resting heart rate means longer life.\r\n\r\nHEART RATE VARIABILITY (“HRV”)\r\nOkay, so we know heart rate is your pulse. How many times the heart beats per minute. So what is this voodoo, then? Well, it turns out that the beats per minute aren’t steady. There’s a minute variation between each one. Some shorter, some longer.\r\n\r\nThis is some of the most interesting new data out there, because HRV is actually a representation of your central nervous system. If you’re not exactly sure what that is, it’s basically your wiring. How signals pass between your brain and the rest of your body. Analyzing this signal indicates if your body is in fight or flight mode, or rest and digest mode. Naturally, you wouldn’t want to unnecessarily be in fight mode which stresses out your body over time.\r\n\r\nRead our full terms of service: \r\nhttps://healthzilla.ai/terms",
