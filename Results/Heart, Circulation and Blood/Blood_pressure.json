It also has an option to put all your inputs into charts that can be printed and/or emailed! If i could give 10 stars I would! Great app! I never leave reviews either, went out of my way for this one.",
            "Love the ability to store the info on my phone, then download it to my PC, or any of the other options this app affords, when I choose to. There's no website or online account to set up access to (AAA+ for that!). The data stays on my phone until I choose to put it somewhere else. All apps should be this user-friendly. Well done!",
            "This has been the best way for us to get my husband to keep track of his blood pressure. He showed his doctor who was impressed with the functionality of the app, especially the ability for my husband to email him the readings. As a student nurse, I have also shown this app to several of my patients who were impressed with how simple and easy to use it was. The only thing I could suggest is adding a spot to record temperature readings so all basic vital signs are recorded.",
            "Add a Temperature Field! Love this app! I never had to keep track of my blood pressure until I got very nervous and it spiked. I'm now on 2 medications & have home & work BP monitors. I used the free app, was very impressed and bought the regular app. Easy to use. The statistics are great. Writing Developers to see if they can add a temperature field.",
            "I've used this app daily for two years now and am very glad that I have. It has helped me lower my blood pressure and weight by being more aware of them. Finally paid, not so much to get rid of the irritating ads as to give credit where it is due. Early on, I found a way around the annoying ads which appear when you save a reading using the New Entry button. Otherwise I might have looked for another app. Use the History button instead and choose today's date. No ads!"

            "Excellent app for recording blood pressure; nice and simple to use; clean and tidy; and a choice of dark or light themes which I always appreciate! You can record as many readings as you like, and as well as the usual systolic & diastolic you can record pulse, blood oxygen, blood glucose, and weight. There's a brilliant statistics section that gives you averages, minimum & maximum readings over a certain time period, and then some graphs which are useful as well. Excellent!",
            "Easy to use. But the field \"note\" cannot be export properly. The field was use for glucose fasting when export to csv. Suggest to add custom field for text note. And custom field (editable name) to draw trend for customizable parameters. Such as body fat etc. 20201016, Appreciated for the quick fix! This app deserves a 5 Star rating. Cheers.",
            "It's a perfect app for keeping track of blood pressure. The only issue I have is when I reboot my phone, it comes up with like 10 straight reminders to take my blood pressure. I do have reminders set for 9:45 am, 3 pm and 7 pm.",
            "Works well enough I paid the couple bucks to get rid of ads. After a few weeks I exported to PDF and took that printout with me to the doctor, and it was very helpful for him to have that data so clearly laid out.",
            "Great app, does exactly what you need and that is to record your blood pressure. The reminders facility is also an added bonus. Finally the report that it generates are very useful and easy to view."

            "The reason why I only give 3 stars is because it only can keep up with your true blood pressure from the machine but you cannot take your blood pressure with this app and it tells you the truth up on it but great to keep up what once was and now",

Most reviews can't be seen and the ones you can are the anon 'a Google user' (aka bots?).",

I have been using it for a number of years, and like the features of the graphical display, the colour coding, the ability to record notes/comments (eg regarding what therapy I'm taking, any symptoms), plus the posture when recording my readings. The ability to export and print out a table of results was also very useful for appointments with my GP and specialists. The only glitch was when part of display changed language.",
            "I like this app! It's simple and does what it's supposed to. Could it have more bells & whistles? Sure, but why? It's just a good, solid app for tracking your blood pressure. The end.",
            "The app is a convenient way to record my bp. Also I really enjoy the alarms reminding me to take my bp, along with the ability to leave a note about when I took my bp in case it might be high/low based on situational circumstances like my nagging wife.",
            "On \"History\" page, dates are half hidden. Do give a drop down menu at top name for choosing another profile when having multiple profiles.",
            "Brilliant little app. Easy to update and gives a nice graph or a listing. I find the graphs default to showing everything, ever, but a pinch and a swipe sorts that out. The only fault I have found is that you can't import old data easily. I shall be in touch with the developer about this."

        "description": "Do stress and blood pressure affect your health?\r\n\r\nJoin the My BP Lab UCSF study to find out.\r\n\r\nAbout the StudyThe UCSF My BP Lab study uses surveys and sensor data from your phone or Galaxy Watch Active to quantify and understand how stress and daily experiences affect your health.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks, complete daily check-ins where you measure stress and emotional experiences during your daily life as well as physiological responses like blood pressure and heart rate. \r\n\r\nParticipants must be 18 years or older to participate and have a Samsung S9 / S9+ / Note9 / S10 / S10+ phone.\r\n\r\nWhy Participate?Your participation will help contribute to scientific knowledge about stress and blood pressure in daily life. Your participation will also help improve measurement of blood pressure through smartphones and wearables. In addition, during the study you will receive insights into when and how much you experience different levels of stress, information about your sleeping patterns, well-being, and how your body responds during stress.\r\n\r\nWhat’s new in 2.0?In addition to new daily questions and improved blood pressure measurement, the newest version of the My BP Lab app offers three major innovations:\r\n\r\nGame-Like Cognitive Tasks\r\nMy BP Lab 2.0 turns brain training around by measuring your memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility with game-like challenges. Why? We want to examine how stress and daily experiences influence cognitive capacity from one moment to the next.\r\n\r\nStress Management Training\r\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed? My BP Lab 2.0 offers stress management training. By opting into the stress management module, you’ll be able to see short videos that teach you skills to help reduce stress and blood pressure. \r\n\r\nGalaxy Watch Active Integration\r\nWith My BP Lab 2.0, you can connect your Galaxy Watch Active to the app and measure your blood pressure straight from your smartwatch in just a few quick touches.\r\n\r\nFAQI'm having difficulty getting a good blood pressure reading. How do I improve the signal?First, check the positioning of your hand. The error may be due to excessive movement. In order to minimize movement, place a pillow under your hand and wrist so that they are fully supported at a 45 degree angle. Additionally, avoid talking, crossing your legs, or taking deep breaths while taking the blood pressure recording.\r\n\r\nTry moving the sensor higher on your finger so that the sensor is resting closer to the tip of your finger rather than the pad of your finger. Make sure your finger is fully covering the light.\r\n\r\nIf you apply pressure to the sensor, it will detect it as movement and you will not get a clear reading. Rest the sensor on your finger and try again.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the room or your hand can affect the quality of the signal. Place your finger in a cup of warm water for 15-30 seconds. Dry your finger thoroughly and try again.\r\n\r\nI only see percentage changes when I take a blood pressure measurement. How do I see my actual blood pressure values?The sensor algorithm needs one initial baseline value from a blood pressure machine as a reference value. Once you enter those reference value numbers then the app will return systolic and diastolic blood pressure numbers. \r\n\r\nIf you do not have any access to a blood pressure machine and do not know you current blood pressure value then the app is still quite useful since you can view the percentage changes in blood pressure over time.\r\n\r\nCan someone else use my phone to measure their blood pressure?Because the app requires you to complete an initial calibration, all of the blood pressure measurements taken through your app will be specific to you. If someone else uses your app to take their blood pressure, the output will not be reflective of that person's blood pressure.",

Once you enter those reference value numbers then the app will return systolic and diastolic blood pressure numbers. <br><br>If you do not have any access to a blood pressure machine and do not know you current blood pressure value then the app is still quite useful since you can view the percentage changes in blood pressure over time.<br><br><h2><b>Can someone else use my phone to measure their blood pressure?</b></h2>Because the app requires you to complete an initial calibration, all of the blood pressure measurements taken through your app will be specific to you. If someone else uses your app to take their blood pressure, the output will not be reflective of that person&#39;s blood pressure.",

Sometimes the watch reading failed, I just remove my watch, clean its sensors and my skin it works again also had to stay still and relax . I know this app established in California for blood pressure study so I answer all the questions honestly. I appreciate this app, helps me having a mini monitor on my wrist for my BP anytime.",

Like also the grid feature to compare blood pressure measurements! You need to get rid of the pop ups because they come on so fast you a person doesn't get a chance to read their blood pressure first after it's taken. So a person doesn't know if the app had changed the Bp measurement . You have to look twice to confirm that the app works!",

            "Not bad, needs minor adjustments. I like the app, it works well and is simple to use. I definitely love the ease of the app. I would prefer the option to be able to type in the temperature, or at the very least be able to record the actual temperature instead of either .0 or .5. There are a lot of in between numbers there that I can't record. It would also be nice to have a notes feature so I could record symptoms or what medication I gave.",
            "Useful for tracking & limiting my social media use. The timer is helpful. The rest is buggy. It counts the Samsung Galaxy always on display as screen time when it's not. I'd like to not receive the daily report notification but there's no way to turn off the notification for that. Also, it counts the headphones being plugged in as on when I just have it plugged in, nothing is playing.",
            "My son has an autoimmune disorder so tracking his temperature is important. I also love that it keeps track of meds and tx. One thing you might consider is a function to enter measuring site (Oral (O), axillary (A), tympanic, or forehead (T), and Rectal (R) My son often gets the (R) @ Dr's request so it's nice to be able to tell his care team all details",
            "Works well for me. Now that the Withings Health Mate app also also tracks temperature, I love the idea of having a separate app for just tracking a cold (haven't had a cold yet to try it out in practice, and hope I won't need to). I'm very impressive with how Withings is improving their app from feedback every version. I've had some updates that weren't as stable, but currently working well for me.",
            "The best fever tracker app i have used. No fuss no frills! Gets me to track my kids' fevers easily and quickly. Not a lot of fancy features which can get confusing (and i mean this in the best way) . It's free and has no ads so thank you to the mom/dad who created such a wonderful app!! Even my kids' pedia says i'm so thorough when i showed this app and she can easily see the fever trend! Good job mom/dad! ????"

I use this app to help with my anxiety, but now these ads pop up and I have to wait before I can use it again. Absolutely the worst thing to happen during a panic attack! So sadly, after many years of use, I'm going to have to uninstall and find an alternative.",
            "this app I've got to say is pretty accurate.. the reason I say that is because I have a medical device that check's your heart rate and oxygen level..now and then I check my heart rate with my cell phone with the heart rate app and compare this app showing my heart rate with my medical device,,which goes over your index finger and there is only 1 or 2 point difference everytime that's pretty good. works good but don't substitute this app from anything you might be using now tommy g So,Cal,"

Best BP app out there in my opinion: it allows you to enter with ease lots of important data on one screen such as blood pressure, heart rate, & weight--while also allowing you to make comments and edit if necessary. A must try bp app if you don't already have it. Cheers to good health fingerprint blood pressure calculator checker blood sugar body temperature!",

            "It is a so called good meter only problem is it's a slide and it's hard to get it to stop on the right number but overall it is a good one it just needs to have the slider fixed because when you go to lift your finger or your stylus the number changes.",
            "Blasting audible ads out while trying to enter data. Can't enter multiple blood pressure readings on the same day. Might would purchase app to avoid ads, but to many annoying problems like the slide bar for entering data is to sensitive, can not simply type numbers!. Will have to look for a better system!!! Gave it a 2 because it does do blood glucose and blood pressure.",
            "The app itself works great, but when you pay to have the ads removed you tend to expect them to go away, not come back with a vengeance. I seem to have more ads now than I had before paying.",

            "Great, simple app. Would be a 5-star if it allowed direct manual entry upon tapping the middle of an input reel. As-is, any varied reading from the last one requires spinning reels.

Edit 2: when editing in the Log, we should be able to change whether the reading is before/after the med, in case we hit the wrong button earlier. Added star for dev response",

Therefore, each hypertensive patient will effectively learn how to reduce high blood pressure. High blood pressure cannot be cured, yet it can be controlled through the implementation of prescriptive medications and life-style modifications.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of anti-hypertensive drugs that physicians prescribe according to the individual needs of the patient. Additionally, there are several natural ways to reduce elevated blood pressure, which involves healthy life- style changes.\r\n\r\nAn anti-hypertensive medication that is prescribed to patients is the thiazide diuretics. The thiazide diuretics are used to lower the resistance of the peripheral vascular or lower the pressure in the walls of the blood vessels.\r\n\r\nHowever, this drug is commonly known to help excrete sodium from the body; thereby lowering blood volume. Another anti-hypertensive drug is the peripheral vasodilators which reduce blood pressure by relaxing the force of contraction of the muscles in the heart.\r\n\r\nWhen prescribed, the dosages are dependent upon the status of the existing blood pressure and the seriousness of pre-existing conditions that increased the risk of developing it initially. Coincidentally, the dosages may be decreased once the blood pressure levels have been reduced.\r\n\r\nHealth care professionals also provide other advice on how to reduce blood pressure. Generally, they often recommend life- style changes that not only reduce the blood pressure, but also help reduce the persistence of annoying side effects caused by the medications. In most cases, the risks for high blood pressure are increased simply due to the decline in practicing healthy life-style regimens. Physicians advise hypertensive patients to eat a healthy diet, to loose weight, and to exercise daily. A healthy diet may consists of fruits and vegetables, foods rich in potassium, low calorie and low-fat foods and/or foods low in sodium.\r\n\r\nExercise may consist of walking, climbing stairs (as opposed to using the elevator), or yoga.

            "Gets my heart rate correct and I'm able to write down how I'm feeling, what time it is, and what I was doing before I took my heart rate. Amazing app, love it. If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of the type of experiment wherein sound is reproduced by analyzing the vibrations of a bag of potato chips through a window in a silent video; that's basically why I accept that this app can work, and work well. It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",
            "Great app. I actually compared its Heart Rate results with a expensive BP Monitor that I have, and I was surprised to see that the Heart Rate reading was very close to the one my expensive BP monitor gave me. I recommend this app. It's a very handy thing to have on your phone when your away from home and can't take your reading with your regular medical monitor.",
            "I have a issue that specialists and doctors are finding hard to workout. This app just showed it occurring. So it does catch what heart is doing. Its not meant to diagnois but atleast you can save it and take to a professional for assessment.",
            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

            "Does not sync properly. I was able to sync readings ONE TIME and have not been able to get it to sync at all since then. This defeats the whole purpose of my purchase in the first place and I will be returning the BP device, since there are better ones out there with apps that actually work.",
            "I just got this machine/app and so far it's very easy to use and understand. I only need to take my blood pressure once daily. I can set reminders on the app. This machine/app also uses two people, so my husband can use it too.",
            "I really like my blood pressure monitor. I use it every day. And I can show my readings to my doctor with my phone. And I keep track of my husbands as well. I would recomend this monitor to anyone. I love it.",
            "Download the app to my phone which is an expensive up-to-date Android and could not get the Bluetooth to connect to the device. I had to manually input each number and the graph only shows a couple of days."

            "Really happy with how the app works, using the amount of medication from last makes it fast to input if nothing has changed, easy to set up reminders for both blood pressure and medication. The data export function works like a charm if you wish to get your data backed up or into another program.",

        "description": "If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you might be worried about taking medication to bring your numbers down.\r\n\r\nLifestyle plays an important role in treating your high blood pressure. If you successfully control your blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle, you might avoid, delay or reduce the need for medication.\r\n\r\nBlood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure.\r\n\r\nWeight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure. Losing even a small amount of weight if you're overweight or obese can help reduce your blood pressure. In general, you may reduce your blood pressure by about 1 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) with each kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of weight you lose.\r\n\r\nRegular physical activity — such as 150 minutes a week, or about 30 minutes most days of the week — can lower your blood pressure by about 5 to 8 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. It's important to be consistent because if you stop exercising, your blood pressure can rise again.\r\n\r\nIf you have elevated blood pressure, exercise can help you avoid developing hypertension. If you already have hypertension, regular physical activity can bring your blood pressure down to safer levels.\r\n\r\nSome examples of aerobic exercise you may try to lower blood pressure include walking, jogging, cycling, swimming or dancing. You can also try high-intensity interval training, which involves alternating short bursts of intense activity with subsequent recovery periods of lighter activity. Strength training also can help reduce blood pressure. Aim to include strength training exercises at least two days a week. Talk to your doctor about developing an exercise program.\r\n\r\nEating a diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and skimps on saturated fat and cholesterol can lower your blood pressure by up to 11 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. This eating plan is known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.\r\n\r\nEven a small reduction in the sodium in your diet can improve your heart health and reduce blood pressure by about 5 to 6 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nAlcohol can be both good and bad for your health. By drinking alcohol only in moderation — generally one drink a day for women, or two a day for men — you can potentially lower your blood pressure by about 4 mm Hg. One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.\r\n\r\nInclusive content of below topics\r\n\r\n1. Natural ways to lower\r\n2. Without Medication\r\n3.

But are there specific foods—not supplements or individual nutrients—that can have a helpful effect? Here's what the research says.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure can triple your risk of heart attack, heart failure and stroke. It’s the silent killer that you don’t even know about — until it hits!\r\n\r\nWhile it is important to use blood pressure medications if you have to, your diet and the foods you eat can also be a helpful tool in lowering your blood pressure naturally.\r\n\r\nFrom long hours at the office to those little annoyances like traffic jams, day-to-day life provides us with a seemingly endless supply of little stresses. While those itty-bitty amounts of stress may seem like no big deal at first, over time, they can send your blood pressure skyrocketing, taking your health along for the ride. That’s why you need to stock up on foods that lower blood pressure.\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, a whopping 75 million Americans—that’s nearly 1/3 of the adult population—are struggling with high blood pressure, increasing their risk of heart attack, stroke, and other life-altering health consequences along the way. Skipping the salt and squeezing in some regular workouts can help keep your blood pressure from reaching dangerous levels, but it takes a more proactive approach to keep your blood pressure under control in the long run.\r\n\r\nWhile the words “blood pressure-lowering diet” may conjure images of unseasoned egg whites and limp steamed veggies, getting your blood pressure into a healthy range is more than just doable —it can be downright delicious.

The developers did get my heart rate going though, and I try not be too critical of anyone, so I will say that the colors are pretty and here's a couple of stars.",

I have to save manually almost all the time. Also it's supposed to be able to track battery health on the sleeve device. It has never done that either."

A NEGATIVE: Even when following manufacturers directions in relation to shutting the monitor off, the Qardio BP drains an exorbitant amount of battery power. The only way I can get a reasonable amount of battery life, is to remove batteries after each use...a bummer! I personally do not use it for anything else.",

            "Well After checking 10s of apps. Including main health apps like Samsung and Google. I always return to Blood pressure DB. Is free to used but I pay for premium because I now feel is the best current app out there for tracking my health. I just wish they added larger font or bigger icons. Cosmetic stuff nothing wrong with the app itself.",
            "I have been using this app for about 1 month and tried at least 6 other applications. This is by far the best as it is accessible with data sync for both my phone and pc. The pdf report is very nice and I don't have to manipulate exported data in a spreadsheet to share with my doctor. Support has been very responsive. A real winner! Thanks Using premium version",
            "I use this App every nite to keep an Eye on my blood pressure and take my lisinopril every nite. I bought yearly subscription it was worth it for all the extra features. I have this App on all my Wins devices plus my Galaxy Note 9 and my fire HD8 tablet, it's nice to have across all my devices, and I like the idea I can create a PDF with all my readings. I check my Blood Pressure, temp, and I use a pulse Oximeter, and enter all my readings every nite. This app is by far the best App I've used",
            "I have loved this app and find that it keeps track of my readings and gives excellent standard reporting including a comparison against WHO normal values which are very critical for me to measure my progress. I can see that while on my whole foods plant based diet my readings have visibly improved over the last eighteen months from normal to optimal"

            "I tried a couple applications with manual entry of blood pressure results, which got tedious, so I bought one of the smart blood pressure monitors (Omron X7 Smart) and tried using Omron Connect app but it lacked features I needed (I.e. for years they are lacking google fit integration), googling around I learned of MedM as the only real alternative to original Omron app. So I gave it a try and I haven't been disappointed. Works flawlessly syncs without problems. One thing worth mentioning is how fast MedM support reacts to support mails and resolves issues. A+",
            "I use Omron Connect but does not want it running 24h while the app does not have a Quit function. Then reading its review I heard about this MedM. But this MedM is worse, just more primitive/basic functions (also no Quit function), so what does it help better? So uninstalled and back to Omron Connect.",
            "Its good but it should support more than one user. For instance, I cannot share the meter with another person because all readings get saved under one name on the app. I wish we could choose different profiles so the readings of different persons could be filed separately. It should be easy to swap from one to the other when synchronizing readings.",
            "Very easy to use, convenient browser.",
            "It's been a long time since I'm trying to find a decent application with a purpose alike. As I found MedM BP my search is finally over. Easy to use, exhaustive output. Simply amazing! Works perfectly with Omron RS7 Intelli IT MedM, thank you guys for such a fine utility. Great job"

        "description": "While you may have heard of hypertension or high blood pressure, suffering from low blood pressure can be as dangerous as well. An optimal blood pressure reading is less than 120mm Hg and above 80 mm Hg.  The first number indicates the systolic pressure or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills with them with blood. The second number represents the diastolic pressure which is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Low blood pressure or hypotension may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs. A sudden drop in blood pressure often occurs when someone suddenly rises from a lying down or sitting position. This is called postural hypo-tension and may cause light-headedness and dizziness. There are some home remedies for low blood pressure that you can employ in order to deal with the symptoms of erratic blood pressure. But if you’ve been feeling the following symptoms for a while, consult your doctor and get your blood pressure measured –\r\n\r\nFatigue\r\nLight-headedness\r\nDizziness\r\nNausea\r\nClammy skin\r\nLoss of consciousness\r\nBlurry vision\r\n\r\nOnce your doctor confirms that your blood pressure is low, follow his advice and take medication if required. A healthy low blood pressure diet is important for low blood pressure treatment. Along with that, here’s more homely help. Your diet plays a crucial role in maintaining your blood pressure.",

            "Quite good but I'm not sure about the accuracy. I use it to record my pulse after exercise but it takes about half the scanning time to settle down and then I see it reducing until it's finished the scan. The final scan value is the one that's recorded so I suppose I need a fitness watch if I want a more accurate reading straight after exercise.",
            "So far so good. I had one descrepencie out of 10. The reading was off. My accuracy is important. I hit my highest weight ever at 330 - 5' 10.5°. I'm on a Pro-Form Stepper and it is amazing the results in 15 minute workouts. So today was my first to complete 15 min 6 1/5 laps without a pause. Walking to my bed edge and measure my rate. 128 bpm. My resting is 61 avg. So I'm trusting my health these numbers are accurate. My wife readings are higher which is also accurate.",
            "After the latest update, I'm always on 56, no matter if I'm running, laying, sitting. Just doesn't matter. I want the previous version back !!",
            "Close but not 100%. I work in Healthcare and have access to multiple devices. Direct comparisons and this is usually within 3-10%. Works fine for monitoring when I'm not at work.",
            "Overall it's quite helpful, with some occasional inconsistency. Measurements are a tad low, but close enough for a quick calculation to get the real reading."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Urgently sort this out or I will have to consider return.",

        "description": "This application is for lowering high blood pressure without medication\r\nHow to lower high blood pressure without medication\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure is a common medical condition. Depending on the level of your blood pressure, you may need to take medication to get it under control. Once high blood pressure (HBP) is under control with medication, you can try using lifestyle techniques to lower your blood pressure and reduce your need for the medication. Using techniques like changes to your diet and lifestyle in combination with medication will help you manage your condition and stay healthy. \r\n\r\nMethod 1\r\nReducing Your Salt Intake\r\n\r\n*Don't add excess salt to your foods*\r\nAvoid adding more than a pinch of salt to your food when you cook it and don't add salt once you are getting ready to eat. You need a small amount of salt in your diet, but you will get more than enough through the prepared foods that you eat and the small amounts you add to your food.\r\nAdding excess salt will only cause you to retain excess fluids, which causes high blood pressure.\r\nKeep in mind that seas salt and kosher salt have the same amount of sodium as regular table salt.\r\nSalt makes your body retain fluid, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure.\r\n\r\n*Avoid eating processed foods*\r\nProcessed foods are typically loaded with salt and other additives, such as the preservative sodium benzoate. Remember, it's not just the salt that you put on your food while cooking or at the table, it's also the amount of sodium that's in the prepared foods that you buy.\r\nSodium causes your body to retain water, which can increase your blood pressure. It is usually listed on the nutritional breakdown on the label of prepared foods.\r\nRead labels and buy low-salt, low-sodium, or unsalted foods.\r\nFoods that commonly have a ton of salt in them are prepared, canned, and bottled foods. These include meats, pickles, olives, soups, chili, bacon, ham, sausage, bakery products, and meats with added water, which will have a higher sodium content. Also, avoid prepared condiments, such as prepared mustard, salsa, chile sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce and other sauces.\r\n\r\n*Track your sodium levels*\r\nMany American diets include up to 5000 milligrams (5g) of sodium daily, which nearly all medical professionals consider extremely unhealthy. While you usually can't, and don't want to, cut out all sodium, it's important to try to get to below 2 g (2000 mg) per day. To do this, track your total daily intake of salt/sodium, and make sure you are avoiding as much sodium as you can.\r\nTo track how much sodium you have eaten it's a good idea to keep a food journal or use a tracking app. There are a variety of fitness and health apps that will allow you to track your sodium intake throughout the day.\r\nA low-sodium diet usually consists of eating between 0 mg and 1400 mg of salt a day. A moderate sodium diet will have between 1400 mg and 4000 mg a day. A high-sodium diet is anything over 4000 mg per day.\r\nKeep in mind that sea salt and kosher salt contain the same amount of sodium as table salt.[6] Salt substitutes contain potassium chloride, which is not safe for some people, so you may want to avoid it. Instead, look into sodium-free alternatives to replace salt in your diet, such as lemon juice, flavored vinegar, fresh herbs, and salt-free herb and spice blends.\r\nNote that the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of sodium is about 2500 mg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for using our application.\r\nDon't forget to check out our other applications.\r\nHopefully this is useful for you.",

            "Wonderful app for Zoom or Telephone Doctor appointments. I will use it for that reason. Gathering my medical data for tomorrow's visit, I find that weight and Oxygen saturation had to be written under comments. Overall, after doing patient care for 38 years, I find this app to be very thorough. Many thanks for organizing my vitals presentation.",
            "Love the simple functionality. Great way to keep track of your own vitals. I would give it a 5 star if we can track more than one person. Ideal for care givers who care for other people... like grandparents or their kids!",
            "Just the right amount of information! I wanted an app that wasn't overwhelming with graphs and charts that I don't understand and that I can email to my doctor. This app does just that! You can also write notes to yourself like... Left arm, sitting, morning, etc. Did I mention that there are NO ADS! Yes, would highly recommend this app.",
            "Simple to input and retrieve data, no ads, no frills, very quick to load and takes little memory or battery. Other than sending a text email of your readings if you choose to do so, it does not use any data. Only thing that needs improvement is the note line - it is difficult to read what has been entered sometimes. If I could request something it would be a meds field to log what taken based on readings.",
            "Wish numbers were assigned to all preset horizontal lines. I have to estimate purpose not knowing value or purpose....what is secret to getting preset horizontal lines to have a value? Rarely does it show up for me ."

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

        "description": "Anura™ is an AI-based application that uses the camera on your mobile phone to measure your general wellness. By taking a 30-second video selfie, Anura™ provides a variety of physiological and psychological results including:\r\n•\tHeart rate\r\n•\tIrregular heartbeats\r\n•\tRespiration rate\r\n•\tBlood pressure (systolic and diastolic)\r\n•\tHeart rate variability\r\n•\tCardiac workload\r\n•\tStress index\r\n•\tBMI\r\n•\tFacial Skin Age\r\n•\tBody Shape Index\r\n•\tWaist-to-Height Ratio\r\n•\tCardiovascular disease risks\r\nAnura™ is the world’s first app allowing for contactless blood pressure measurement with only a 30-second video selfie. According to the American Heart Association (https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/why-high-blood-pressure-is-a-silent-killer), many people with high blood pressure are not aware of their hypertensive condition. The computational models used by Anura™ were developed using medical-grade equipment and scientific instruments found in labs and clinics. The accuracy of Anura™ measurements has been tested and validated at both NuraLogix, the developer of Anura™, and university labs.\r\nAnura’s Features and Benefits:\r\n•    Contactless – No sensors, contacts, or cuff to touch. Measurements are taken just like a selfie!\r\n•    Quick – It requires only 5 seconds to start measuring your heart rate, and a comprehensive measurement takes only 30 seconds.\r\n•    Private - Your blood flow information is encrypted when sent to our cloud servers for analysis and your measurement history is stored using the same encryption techniques that are used by banks. Your video images are never saved while performing a measurement.\r\n•    Use Anura™ often to increase your awareness of stress and general wellness.\r\n•    Free – Most importantly, Anura is completely free to use!\r\nThe underlying science:\r\n•\tHuman skin is translucent. Light and its respective wavelengths are reflected at different layers below the skin and can be used to reveal blood flow information in the human face.\r\n•\tOur Transdermal Optical Imaging (TOI™) technology extracts this information and sends it securely up to the cloud to be processed by DeepAffex™, our cloud-based Affective AI engine.\r\n•\tCardiovascular disease risk, heart attack risk, and stroke risk are calculated upon the Framingham Method and derived from an algorithm developed based on data from prospective studies that followed up with participants in terms of their cardiovascular health for over ten years.\r\nIf you would like to know more about the research, science, and technology used by Anura™ please refer to the links below:\r\n•\tSystem and Method for Contactless Blood Pressure Determination - http://assets.deepaffex.ai/nuralogix/pdf/System-and-Method-for-Contactless-Blood-Pressure-Determination-Patent.pdf\r\n•\tSystem and Method for Camera-Based Heartrate Tracking - http://assets.deepaffex.ai/nuralogix/pdf/US10117588.pdf\r\n•\tSmartphone-Based Blood Pressure Measurement Using Transdermal Optical Imaging Technology - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.119.008857\r\n•\tMeasuring Blood Pressure from Cuff to Smartphone - http://assets.deepaffex.ai/nuralogix/pdf/Barszczyk-Lee2019_Article_MeasuringBloodPressureFromCuff.pdf\r\nANURA™ IS NOT FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES\r\nDon’t forget that Anura is not a substitute for the clinical judgment of a health care professional. Anura is intended to improve your awareness of general wellness. Anura does not diagnose, treat, mitigate or prevent any disease, symptom, disorder, or abnormal physical state.

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

            "App used to work amazing. Now after the latest update it no longer allows me to use the app to begin a blood pressure ready. I have to manually enter the BP reading after I initiate it on the cuff itself. So much for ease of use Bluetooth. Not the most efficient. Most times I can't get the app to load fast enough to record the readings. So I have to start a whole new reading.. Then I can record it.",
            "Terrible app! Extremely unresponsive to touch input (i.e., it takes 10-20 attempts at tapping/swiping to get anything on the screen to respond), there is no way to see a list of all the readings that have been taken (you have to TRY to swipe through the list of readings at the top), and it simply WILL NOT share the results to any external source. The \"Share\" button is as unresponsive as the \"close door\" button on an elevator. This horrible app renders a very overpriced BP cuff nearly useless!",
            "This app is highly unreliable. Won't start the device (take a measurement) half the time and over a week ago just stopped working completely. Won't pair to device or take measurement now. Tried all the basic troubleshooting methods...none worked. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app...now trying to get it to pair and re-establish my user account. Very frustrating.",
            "This app worked intialy, then the glucoose feature stoped working quickly followed by the BP feature, it no longer update my BP readings to the app, defeating it purpose. Waste of Mony if the app doesn't work.",
            "It works like it is supposed to once you get your phone to identify it by Bluetooth. The app. has all these instructions telling you the hard way to do things. The easy way is simply to drag the screen down like you do on any other app. to update info and it will upload all your BP pressure info and tabulate it on an ongoing basis. As for the hard way, that works too, but it's like all things that use Bluetooth it can be slow and sometimes not respond. The simple way avoids all that, just drag the screen down and forget the rest."

        "title": "Stress Releaser Meditation High Blood Pressure",
        "description": "Stress Releaser is first biofeedback Android application that helps guide you through for calm and relaxing meditation with a biofeedback point system. It can low your blood pressure. The biofeedback HRV wave will help remind you of the relaxation level of your breathing practice. This app was designed to be not only simple and easy to use but also effective for use in modern life. You are able to set up your own breath pace and practice timer which eliminates any worry of missing an appointment or any other obligation you may have. This app has the exact same functionalities as other biofeedback devices which have been demonstrated effective for relaxation therapy. However, with melody in addition to visual aids, this biofeedback app allows you to relax further and be able to note your relax level.  No special attachment or hardware is needed for this biofeedback app. Clinical trials have shown that slow, deep breathing can bring down your high blood pressure to 14/8 mmHg points within couple weeks practice. Stress Releaser now gives everyone a chance to practice without pay enormous sums of money for those expensive, hardware devices. Now, you can buy Bluetooth Oximeter sensor (FDA approved) for more relaxed experience without put your finger on the back camera. Search StressReleaser in Amazon or eBay for the Oximeter. You have to buy it from there otherwise it is not working with the App.\r\nPurpose of App:\r\n1)\tLower your high blood pressure.\r\n2)\tHelp with insomnia and aid with better sleep.\r\n3)\tReduce your daily stress and make you calmer and your life more peaceful\r\n4)\tHelp relieve your stress and depression.\r\n5)\tMake you more focus for your study and work.  \r\n6)\tUseful in managing headaches and migraines.\r\n7)\tSlow, deep breathes can also help with pain management.\r\n8)\tHelp you with better mediation.\r\nHow to use it:\r\n1)\tFirst time users should go through 15 minutes training session to find the most comfortable breathe pace. Cover your back camera lens with your finger completely. You don’t have to cover your LED but should make sure the light is strong enough to help camera to read your pulse. For those phones with large distance between camera and LED, try to put your finger tip perpendicular to camera surface and let LED lightning the finger tip.\r\n2)\tAfter you know the most comfortable breathe pace, go to settings and set the breath pace to your comfortable level. Also you can set practice timer for your practice session. \r\n3)\tUse your finger to fully cover phone’s back camera lens. Make sure LED is lighting your finger from side as closer as possible. The detected heart rate should be pretty constant. If you see your heart rate changes too high or too low, you probably didn’t fully cover lens with your finger.  If your finger feels too hot, you can use small plastic glass glue to back of your phone to cover your lens and LED.\r\n4)\tRemember the whole purpose of the practice of deep slow breathing is to achieve coherence with your nerve system through your smooth breath with concentration. Usually it takes a couple minutes to adjust your breath to get to the calm stage. \r\n5)\tThe suggested practice time is two, fifteen minutes session a day to achieve around 200 points. The ideal breath pace is from 5 to 6 breath per minutes to achieve coherence. If you follow the recommended practice time, you should feel and see results after six weeks of practice. Use your breath practice in your daily live.\r\n6)\tThis is not medical device.

        "descriptionHTML": "Stress Releaser is first biofeedback Android application that helps guide you through for calm and relaxing meditation with a biofeedback point system. It can low your blood pressure. The biofeedback HRV wave will help remind you of the relaxation level of your breathing practice. This app was designed to be not only simple and easy to use but also effective for use in modern life. You are able to set up your own breath pace and practice timer which eliminates any worry of missing an appointment or any other obligation you may have. This app has the exact same functionalities as other biofeedback devices which have been demonstrated effective for relaxation therapy. However, with melody in addition to visual aids, this biofeedback app allows you to relax further and be able to note your relax level.  No special attachment or hardware is needed for this biofeedback app. Clinical trials have shown that slow, deep breathing can bring down your high blood pressure to 14/8 mmHg points within couple weeks practice. Stress Releaser now gives everyone a chance to practice without pay enormous sums of money for those expensive, hardware devices. Now, you can buy Bluetooth Oximeter sensor (FDA approved) for more relaxed experience without put your finger on the back camera. Search StressReleaser in Amazon or eBay for the Oximeter. You have to buy it from there otherwise it is not working with the App.<br>Purpose of App:<br>1)\tLower your high blood pressure.<br>2)\tHelp with insomnia and aid with better sleep.<br>3)\tReduce your daily stress and make you calmer and your life more peaceful<br>4)\tHelp relieve your stress and depression.<br>5)\tMake you more focus for your study and work.  <br>6)\tUseful in managing headaches and migraines.<br>7)\tSlow, deep breathes can also help with pain management.<br>8)\tHelp you with better mediation.<br>How to use it:<br>1)\tFirst time users should go through 15 minutes training session to find the most comfortable breathe pace. Cover your back camera lens with your finger completely. You don’t have to cover your LED but should make sure the light is strong enough to help camera to read your pulse. For those phones with large distance between camera and LED, try to put your finger tip perpendicular to camera surface and let LED lightning the finger tip.<br>2)\tAfter you know the most comfortable breathe pace, go to settings and set the breath pace to your comfortable level. Also you can set practice timer for your practice session. <br>3)\tUse your finger to fully cover phone’s back camera lens. Make sure LED is lighting your finger from side as closer as possible. The detected heart rate should be pretty constant. If you see your heart rate changes too high or too low, you probably didn’t fully cover lens with your finger.  If your finger feels too hot, you can use small plastic glass glue to back of your phone to cover your lens and LED.<br>4)\tRemember the whole purpose of the practice of deep slow breathing is to achieve coherence with your nerve system through your smooth breath with concentration. Usually it takes a couple minutes to adjust your breath to get to the calm stage. <br>5)\tThe suggested practice time is two, fifteen minutes session a day to achieve around 200 points. The ideal breath pace is from 5 to 6 breath per minutes to achieve coherence. If you follow the recommended practice time, you should feel and see results after six weeks of practice. Use your breath practice in your daily live.<br>6)\tThis is not medical device. You needs consult your doctor to change dose or stop your medication if you see your high blood pressure dropping.<br>Phone requirements:<br>\tThe Android phone has to be Galaxy II equivalent or up. The pulse detection is heavily reliant on the camera’s speed and phone’s process power.",

            "Great app! I've used several diabetes trackers and this is the best, for average use. It allows you to track the important stuff your doctors ask for and provides exports of data, but it's simple to use and not too complicated to set up. I paid the $1.99 U.S. to upgrade to the Pro version with no ads. It's well worth that fee. ***IDEA FOR THE DEVELOPER*** I like the Measured drop list where I can select a description for each blood test, such as \"fasting\" or \"after breakfast.\" Would you mind expanding that just a little to match what doctors in the U.S. ask for? Here's what I'm thinking: (1) CHANGE the three existing \"Before\" meal options to say \"Immediately before.\" Example: \"Before breakfast\" would become \"Immediately before breakfast.\" (2) ADD three meal options that begin with \"2 hours before.\" Example: \"2 hours before breakfast.\" ***MORE IDEAS FOR DEVELOPER:*** (3) Allow me to set an automatic recurring backup to a cloud drive location of my choice, such as a Google Drive folder. (4) Provide the option of a web interface with quick data entry and data exports. I work on a computer all day so it would be faster for me to type my data into a bookmarked browser page than use my phone. I would only use my phone when I'm away from my computer. (5) You could add some \"about this app\" info inside the app. It might include the official name of the app, links to a web interface, company info, company email, developer info, links to review the app on Play Store, etc. Thanks for considering my ideas and thanks for making a great, stable app that is easy to use and understand!",
            "Great app. Easy to use for recording blood sugar and blood pressure levels and the report feature allows you to easily share your data with your doctor. The ads can be annoying, but for a free app that works well that is only a minor issue.",
            "Looks pretty good. Only thing I would suggest for an upgrade. With the blood pressure it is set on the right arm and it is necessary to change it every time for my left arm. It would be good if there was something in settings to be able to set it to the left arm permanently. Not only for us right-handed people. The bloke at the chemist where I bought my blood pressure device said that it is better to use the left arm. Something to do with the circulatory system.",
            "Excellent app. It helps remind me to watch what I eat. I can see the cause and effect of my choices. So this hells me stay on track. I love the \"Statistics\" data and the fact I can express the data to PDF for my doctor. I highly recommend this app 👍",
            "Great application. Just one thing is missing that there should be combined report chart of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight."

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"
