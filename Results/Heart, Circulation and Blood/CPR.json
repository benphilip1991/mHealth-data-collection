            "An exceptionally useful app where this service is available. Though it only happened once, it told me exactly where to go for a nearby CPR request. Luckily, the person didn't need CPR, but it indeed worked. Keep in mind that this only works if your city's Emergency Services have paid for the PulsePoint contract. Although you could argue privacy concerns, I feel saving a life trumps privacy. Helpful side benefit, it can also tell you where car accidents are, so it helps as a navigation aid too.",
            "Good basic information of situations in the area or nearby. More follow up info would be helpful to know if a situation is contained or cleared. If possible, traffic associated with affected areas would be good in order to change routes if necessary. The ability to narrow to one geographical region/area vs just by depts. for overnight/sleep mode would be a nice addition so you can be alerted for only certain areas while you sleep.",
            "The only improvement would be adding more detail to the incidents when possible, but that would take tremendous resources and so for a free app with no intrusive ads this is perfect. I now know within minutes or even seconds from hearing sirens if it is a vehicle collision, vegetation or vehicle fire, medical emergency and more. I can reroute myself or call neighbors or loved ones or even work. Living in a rural community this app could literally be a life saver with the CPR notifications.",
            "Update: The agency I follow and was offline, was contacted by Pulse Point. They were told they know of problems and were fixing. Sound came back on yesterday. Thank you for helping me. Update: Been told the agency I'm following must have cut the feed. Loved this app. Been using for months. Then all of sudden when sound button pressed it will not stay on. So no sound. I've checked all settings. Removed and reinstalled no sound.",
            "It helps to know where events are happening. When a notice comes up while looking at the map the box with the info is over half the map making it hard to see the area on the alert. I did not sign up for the CPR alerts but it overwhelms with the broken heart icon. ( accidents)"

So I close them and restart them. Then I get the obnoxious commercial before it goes back to real programming. I have found this happens with CPR, with MPR, and with the Prairie Public Radio app. It always seems to happen on the same day across all of the apps. Oddly enough, when one works great throughout the day, they all work great.",

You go into settings and clear out all the running apps including this one and yet it keeps playing. There's something seriously wrong with this app and will not be using it until you realize it needs to be fixed. Absolutely nuts.",

I don't have this issue with any other streaming apps. Please fix this. This has literally been a problem with the app for years.",
            "I love CPR but deleted this app about 10 minutes later.

            "Good basic tool. For most people, compressions only CPR has become the norm. The thought is that if rescuers can remember one thing in crisis mode it would be most beneficial if it was good compressions and timing. For more advanced CPR providers, and/or rescues where more than one person is on scene who is a trained first responder, rescue breathes between compressions is preferable. It would be good to have a preference setting for either style.",
            "Easy to set up, beeps to keep chest compression rhythm, notes start time and duration automatically ~ if you keep it running. It doesn't prompt breaths after the cpr cycle, it just continues to the next cpr cycle. It should either talk and say ventilate, ventilate at an appropriate pace, then continue; or stop and allow you to resume manually. It doesn't allow either.",
            "Works as a good metronome. Ignore the people talking about the pause for ventilation, as it has been proven that it dosent help as much as thought, and actually slows done the preassure being built from cpr.",
            "It doesn't pause for the two ventilations and that could alter the number of compressions you do after the first cycle. Please add a pause for ventilations!",

Come on Laerdal sort it out!",
            "I bought four QCPR little anne to improve my cpr training. They worked great and students worked well with them. However I can no longer access the app on my Samsung A5 as it is no longer compatible.........very very annoying.",
            "Hate this app. 98% of the time it won't work. When it works, it's great and learners love it, but having spent a lot of money on the QCPR gear, this is shockingly bad quality.  This app should work on *all* phones, and should work flawlessly, considering the considerable costs involved. I've tried this app on quite a few different types and brands of phone, on most it won't even recognise the manikin, and when it does, the app just says 'start when ready' but then that text stays instead of the app itself starting.  Very, very frustrating.",
            "Has been very difficult to get any connection on an android with the manakins. just recently was able to get it to connect, but then the app did not keep up with the students activity, so there was no useful feedback. android version seems to be lagging far behind the iPhone versions of the app, both instructor and learner",
            "The breaths are rarely recognized and if they are recognized, its when gastric inflation would have occurred on a human. The CPM seems to need calibration, it measures the CPM as faster than what I am reading with my stopwatch. When purchasing, we knew it was available for use with android devices, so we bought small android tablets only to discover that they wouldn't work. Manufacturer should guide the users better and help by making the whole system easier for use in classrooms."

            "Useful app; simple to use. Paid for the \"Super Duper\" version, to set the compression rate. On re-booting my phone it keeps reverting to the standard \"Super\" version. Despite reporting this, I still have the standard version. Also, a 5-10 second pause every 30 compressions, for \"EAR\" (breaths) would be useful. Most first-aiders struggle to keep count of the 30:2 ratio",
            "I get that this is for \"entertainment only\" but I really have to question the mindset of creating an app that is likely to be used in a life threatening situation which has such appallingly inappropriate presentation. I'd be willing to let the superhero style splash screen slide but some of the included sounds are wholly inappropriate for use in a situation where the user is performing CPR on someone's loved on. A shame because it is a nice, functional app but totally sunk by the presentation",
            "Great app. Would like to add to the medication button though. The med button works great if you only give adrenalin, but not so much for any other drugs. Maybe an event button with options added on?",
            "I have the paid version and this app is great with one exception: I can't set the BPM to 112. My cardiac arrest policy requires us to compress at 112 and my only options here are 110 and 115, rendering this well done app useless to me on the job. Everything else is just as I had hoped for and the sounds are amusing for training. Edit for reply: Sadly my county policy is very specific about a metronome at 112bpm despite AHA guidelines. Sounds silly, but it's what we got",
            "Love the App The only thing I don't like about the app is when you push the med botton that you gave a med, its not a button there to select which med you gave, like Epi, Amioardone, Sodium Bicarbonate, etc. That option would help a whole lot when you are looking at your log and it not only shows that you gave a med, but which med that you gave. If the name of the Meds, atleast the ones you would give during CPR could be added under the med option, it would he greatly appreciated."

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

When I opened the app there was a lot of good guidance but I could not locate a pulse oximeter. Very disappointed. Uninstalling. I have increased my rating because of the excellent, and immediate response, offered by the developer following my review.",
            "Great tool for preparing for ACLS, PALS, and BLS. Great pocket guide for the real thing. And no cost! I'm tired of being nickled and dimed to buy books, apps and take courses to help rescue people. What I need to know is pretty much in the app.",
            "This app gives access to free online courses. At the end you'll recieve a printable PDF certificate and wallet card. Unfortunately, not all the courses are as informative as I'd hoped (BBP, ACLS, and PALS are good). I also wish one had to watch all videos before taking the exam(s) and that exams were longer on some of the courses (ACLS and PALS exams are good). Overall, it has some good courses, but they need to be more challenging. I rate 3 stars. That's the best I've rated on an online course."

            "Pretty cool - very detailed, lots of possible interventions and a broad variety of cases with lots of pathology. Great for learning and practicing. However: 1. Sooo buggy, cant get throigh a case without it crashing. if they could make it stable this would be an awesome app, but as it is its unplayable. 2. Some non-evidence based 'critical' interventions - compulsory O2 for normoxaemic MIs 3. Lack of geriatrics affects the realism somewhat.",
            "this is a good app which gives senarios and is fun to do. my criticisms are that the app will freeze and crash in the middle of a scenario when playing a few in a row. Also more conversions to the units done in the uk would be helpful. Also some of the bloods that would be classified as not necessary in the app are ones we would routinely do. however overall this is useful and enjoyable",
            "I am a premed student, and would recommend this app 10/10 for anyone with a serious interest in learning about medicine. As well as entertaining and challenging, this app has been massively educational for me over the past four years. Extra cases are well worth the price. Case discussions and required attention to detail make this app second to none."

This program will help prepare participants to handle these events and other life-threatening incidents.\r\n\r\nThe Basic Life Support (BLS): CPR and First Aid provider program is designed to provide course participants with foundational knowledge and teach skills needed to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other lifesaving skills.\r\n\r\nDuring this course, participants will become familiar with the signs and symptoms associated with cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack as well as with other diseases and conditions that may also pose an immediate threat to life.

        "description": "Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric patients, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\r\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life. While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \r\n\r\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\r\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  You also have access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient. Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\r\n\r\nCASE DESIGN \r\nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents.  He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \r\nTwitter: @MinervaMedSim\r\nWeb: https://full-code.com",

            "My furnace was awesome I learned a lot the biggest thing I learned was a pet temperature if I took a piss temperature and I saw it was a hundred and I would think I was high and be worried and scared when in fact just normal and I had no idea you would do is 30 repetitions when with a human it's only half dozen approximately thank you for putting this together",
            "I wish the app covered the amount of any given substance that may be dangerous given a dog or cat's size, health status, etc. I understand they don't want to discourage humans from seeking help when they should, though. One thing I do think should be changed: \"tylenol/acetaminophen\" is listed separately from \"pain relievers,\" and since it comes later alphabetically, a human checking the list of toxic substances could stop at \"pain relievers\" and never see the information they need.",
            "Very informative! I really appreciate the quizzes the app offers to test your knowledge and keep your skills sharp for situations where first aid is needed.",
            "Alot of very helpful information. Life saving information and more! Great app and thanks for it.",
            "🐈 A great guide for cat and dog basic first aid! 🐕 While not a replacement for proper veterinary care, this app is very well done and easy to follow, full of useful info for dealing with a large variety of problems pet owners might face - with not just facts, but also videos to guide you in performing emergency first aid properly. It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!"

The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation.",

            "I've been using this app for almost a year but it doesn't support username and password, other ftp applications do , I know it has an option to give access the other devices to connect or not,,but it's not as secure as the username and password, one of my friends is a hacker and he said I can bypass the authorization this app provides,and he did bypass it , I personally did not allow him to access to the phone when he requested but he gained the access anyway !! so add userpass I'll give 5stars",
            "I don't know what is wrong with my phone or my PC or Zapya app ar program. I was able to use Zapya/Zapya webshare for file transfer, but recently it has become impossible to establish a connection between Android and Windows 10.",
            "Connects fast & transfers data fast. But the process never completes due to server issues. Then what's the use?!",

It turns on by itself, but still goes through the steps of the assessment, even though the pads were applied previously. You never get a shock advised and the scenario does not change.

        "description": "Being a Good Samaritan, Saving Lives, saving lives of strangers, saving lives of near and dear ones, is a pious deed. In fact, a life saved is a life created. When you save a life, you create a life on Earth. By saving lives, you become the Lord’s messenger on Earth. So what are your chances of playing messenger, so you can save your mother, father, son, daughter, brother, wife, sister, and all your near and dear ones and even the not so near ones? \r\n\r\nHere are some numbers which suggest you stand a good chance of saving your family, your loved ones and probably yourself. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US (every year 225000 people die and 6 out of 1000 are prone to have a heart attack in the US). If that sounds scary, the world’s two most populous nations, India and China, each with a billion plus population, have a far more accelerating growth rate of heart attacks. As a case in point, coronary heart attack in urban India is more than ten percent and growing. Rest of the world does not differ too much either. \r\n\r\nThese growing numbers metaphorically indicate that the hearts are getting smaller and weaker, the arteries which carry blood to the heart are also getting smaller in comparison to the bulging pockets, bulging cholesterol in the arteries, the bulging stressful lives, and the bulging sedentary lifestyle we are leading. \r\n\r\nBut you can play God, e r Messenger. You can save lives. Hundreds of them. All you need is to understand and get trained on CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation). You can save people affected by heart attacks. It’s as easy as 123. CPR ensures flow of blood to the brain, even after the stoppage of a heart due to cardiac arrest, and keeps the person alive. To help you get started on CPR, we have this small little app with the latest CPR guidelines, CPR principles, legal, technical, devices, steps, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, you may skip an internet connection in a trail in the Tundras or the Grand Canyon or in the Amazon rain forest, or in the Canadian Prairies, but the heart may skip a beat anywhere, for any of your loved ones. Keeping this in mind, we’ve ensured that once downloaded, this app works offline, even when there is no internet connection.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps, saving lives is easier than you thought.

        "description": "PulsePoint AED is a simple-to-use tool that enables you to help build the public AED registry in your community!\r\n\r\nAEDs that are managed using PulsePoint AED are assessable to emergency dispatchers and disclosed to emergency responders, including nearby citizens trained in CPR and off-duty professionals such as firefighters, paramedics and nurses. Instead of asking the caller if there is an AED available, dispatch center staff can inform callers of nearby lifesaving devices.\r\n\r\nPulsePoint AED also records and displays other lifesaving resources placed at AED locations including Bleeding Control Kits, Naloxone (e.g., NARCAN®) and Epinephrine (e.g., EpiPen®).\r\n\r\nWatch this brief video to see just how easy it is to add an AED to the community registry https://vimeo.com/pulsepoint/AED-Android You can also add an AED to the registry anytime by simply entering aed.new into your browser.\r\n\r\nIf you are trained in CPR and willing to assist during a nearby cardiac emergency, please consider downloading the companion app, PulsePoint Respond. Let’s save some lives together!\r\n\r\nWhat’s an AED?\r\nAn AED (automated external defibrillator) is a lifesaving device that automatically diagnoses and treats cardiac arrest. AEDs are common in public places such as offices, airports and other locations where people congregate.

Third party authentication is no longer supported.",
        "comments": [
            "App will not open. Crashes immediately upon opening. Have sent feedback multiple times and no response. When it was working, months ago, enjoyed it and used it to put AEDs on the map often.",
            "I have to give it low stars right now cause i dont know how to search the area for the closest! Sure if i open the map and expand it i can see where they are- add a search button to take you to the closest and allow for navigation directions... This doesnt work like that on my phone. Being AED/CPR certified i cant just pull the app up, throw my phone to a person and say \"go get it\"",
            "Good app. Easy to use. It would be nice to be able to add locations when you are offline. I don't have data on my phone (I know I am in the minority) so I can add locations when I am connected to wifi but I can't add pictures unless I have wifi where the AED is. It would be useful to be able to add pictures stored on my phone. Thus if there is no wifi I can snap a picture of the AED and add it later when I am connected.",
            "I havent had to used this app in an emergency but I think its a great service. I live in a small town and check it to see where the AEDs are in case of an emergency. Makes me realize there probably arent enough around.",
            "Any way to reward people to find and add AED devices? Its useless right now since there are no AEDs listed in my area. Not many people know about this app, dont have the time to find AEDs and list them only when they happen to come across one and remember to add it manually in the app. Advertise more. Same with the other pulse point app. It will take a while i understand. But i believe if theres a reward system it will be a start."

            "Honestly this fame is surprisingly complex and well made. Really quite fun and I do enjoy the challenge of having no medical training IRL. The only complaint I have is that every single time I get someone to the hospital it says the heart is not beating, no matter what happens it says that and it punishes you by taking money from you. Only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars really.",
            "I was really excited as a medic to find this game and it has such great potential, however.... some functions are just so unrealistic. If you have a patient that has went into full arrest you can't give the proper medication, perform cpr, and ventilate at the same time in this game. Also you can't even get the proper medications without purchasing and it takes forever to earn cash. Not to mention you can't even move up on the courses without paying to which I found very disappointing.",
            "5 stars until I couldn't restore my purchases or game data from the cloud when I reset my phone! Really fun game! I love when it gets harder and adds more than one condition. The English isn't 100% but is understandable and educational. Really worth paying for the extra modes. I would add something like \"flash cards\" so you can access the information at the end of the course into the game. The Course 0 is a bit long, but those last few slides on each condition are very helpful.",
            "Well, it's fun and I consider this the best med game here. It's in a whole new level from other games where they do baby talks. Here, you gotta read and memorize. Tho things are way different in real life, well this game is much more realistic than the others. But this is just a game which should also be taken a bit seriously. It also let me use my head in the hardest conditions like being in the early level without any upgrade and having a bleeding patient. It's satisfying.",
            "Very helpful, fun and addicting game! Been playing it for almost 5 months now. Im on the 3rd month of my pre-med journey and this is somehow accurate.. I hope we can change the name of the drugs that we are using so it can be really accurate and also I wish the manual breathing intibation can be removed, the preparing of defib have accurate sounds and charges/prepares as fast as how it really works in real life..and also an accurate gender figure female human for female and vice versa love it💜"

        "description": "Apprenez les gestes de premiers secours avec le Bataillon de Marins-Pompiers de Marseille !\r\n\r\nCe «Guide de Premiers Secours Civiques» a été élaboré par des médecins et des formateurs en premiers secours du Bataillon de Marins-Pompiers de Marseille, afin de permettre à tout un chacun d'avoir facilement accès, à tout moment, à toutes les connaissances nécessaires et toutes les conduites à tenir permettant d'apporter les premiers secours à des victimes.\r\n\r\nPrésentée sous forme de fiches faciles à compulser, la description des gestes de premiers secours est accompagnée de superbes illustrations réalisées spécifiquement, afin d'en faciliter la compréhension et la réalisation.\r\n\r\nNous vivons dans un monde où les sources de risques, de dangers et de menaces sont multiples et variées, tant au quotidien que lors d’évènements exceptionnels.

            "I am tasked with entering over 100 AEDs in my area. However, despite saying \"This AED has been added\", it fails to show. Stranger still is that some of these will appear at a later date on the map only to disappear again. I asked my wife to check on her phone supposing that this might be a problem with my mobile, but she too couldn't see those I've added.   Living in a tourist area I am anxious to get this done while the season's here, but I'm frustrated by this problem.   I have raised a support ticket but this hasn't been answered yet.   Not very impressed.",
            "Seems to be the only aed locator which has a complete database of my local defibs (i have tried 3 others). It would be much better if the app size was smaller. 60mb is a lot when you only have 8gb storage.:\\ great idea though. Everyone should be able to find one in energencies.",
            "Great app, but outdated information in my area. When I try to add new defibs I get an error (\"An error occurred, check the fields\") despite checking the fields multiple times. I'd love to enhance the app by adding defibs in my area - I'm in UK on a Oneplus 5T"

I'm on Android on a Nokia Note 8 if that helps. Other than that, it's great",

Deletion should require going into a Settings menu perhaps. During my codes I've almost deleted these accidentally when simply trying to select. 2) Add an alarm for when starting compressions, pulse check, epi, etc. is due. 3) Have a ability to add notes during the code such as depth of tubes Again, overall a great app that is very user friendly.",
            "Great app but could be really improved. It would be better if the timers were countdown with a notification to let us know when rhythm check or next epi is due. Would really be helpful for short staffed hospitals like where I work where the code team has to improvise with a shortage of hands. This has been a great help to our ICU of 2 staff though. Looking forward to seeing the suggested improvements in the next update.",
            "RN in the ER I love this!!!! I would like to have an option to add notes on events already added to the log, for example: event: endotracheal intubation shows on the log, would be nice to have a \"+\" toggle on the right to quickly add notes such as size and placement etc Or the ability to manually enter in cascading options to events Overall love it! Would have used it today if I had it, but was stuck with paper on a John Doe pt who dropped at the front door, next time!",
            "Awesome app! Definitely the best vode log I've seen. I work in a Peds ER so all drugs are weight based anf vary from pt. To pt. Would live the added feature of logging doses of meds quickly. Thanks for the awesome app!",

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

            "Im a big fan of 911 game and was expecting interesting stuff from 112. I have few feedback after playing initial 1 hr. The Operator sounds so tired and put off ! As if he is compelled to do the job or half sleeping, it instantly puts off the excitement of taking a call. There is a bar which shows how much time is being taken to solve a case but I would have preferred a countdown timer as in 911. Along with few more things but I don't have letters to type. All in all, The game looks unfinished.",
            "Unnecessary Permissions! I wanted to test the demo before buying the game but now I won't get anything from this developer. Sophos Intercept X warned me because it tracks your location and movements, it has FULL read & write access to ALL storage on your device, and it is allowed to run on a locked device. No game needs that. Uninstalled.",
            "It's no doubt is a great game, but few changes can definitely make it more joyful. - Sandbox mode is almost standard for most management games. Ppl can use the advantage to play with their imagination or test out game functions. - mobile screen is so small that it is so easy to accidentally tap on the wrong vehicle even with screen zoomed in. - I was using default mode to play and is rly hoping there's a way to cancel the selected vehicle. Or I'll end up sending units all around the map.",
            "Nice time killer. The design is good and there's plenty to do. I'm not sure if the full game is worth 7 bucks, as something like this can become repetitive, in which I would lose interest. However, for people that enjoy things like this, 7 bucks isn't much.",
            "Definitely better than 911 operator. It controls a heck of a lot better. The only improvement I would add is that controlling the fast forward and slow down menu is a little clunky and confusing."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

But the one thing that has been a pain & a prevention for me to achieve that, is this freaking bug that's causing the game to crash & making me loose the progress I had on a level. The good news is it's not \"THE ENTIRE PROGRESS OF THE GAME\". Lol 5 stars says you will get this game bug taken care of real quickly.",
            "The campaign story is incredible, and there are many interesting scenarios that make the game both decently replayable and constantly entertaining. The only possible complaint I could think of is that the campaign could use more stories, as I could play this game for hours, and being interrupted but something like a story over screen is kind of underwhelming, considering the final part of the story doesn't really feel like an ending. Overall, 5/5 and I would rate higher if I could, great game",
            "Knew I'd love this game! Been a fan of 911 Operator for ages now, so was excited to try this one! Put a few hours into it since I downloaded it earlier and I think that it will keep me busy for ages! Few niggles encountered, but it's so young that I'm sure they won't be there for long!",
            "I am so glad 112 Operartor was created for Andriod. I have the original as well as both versions on PC. I love how the calls are new and the extra add on features like emails and missions. It is like I am on the job itself. It is definitely worth the money.",
            "Love the game. Only problem i have is that its constantly crashing and freezing up. Have had to replay 2nd stage 5 times and cant progress as it keeps crashing. Its understandable as the game was just released, however this needs to be patched."

Not enough information to answer some of them and when a answer is submitted, the same answer one time gives a red X and the exact same answer another time a Green check mark. I haven't found the app practice changing. Actually, from a practical aspect it is fairly useless. Lipid emulsion? Wow, that's digging deep.",

Also, I've not run across material on hypothermia post ROSC, Narcan administration, nor emergent C-section post failed resussitation on the mother. All-in-all though, I think this is a very good refresher or study tool. I just can't give better than 3 stars due to the inaccurate content.

When I have one open in a different app, the alarm stops the metronome and I have to go back into that app to restart it. One in this app would make it handsfree and restarting is not forgotten. Have the cycles continuously restarting, for same reasons. A setting for the phone screen to stay awake when the app is running.",

It's been a year since I got it, and have not been able to get past the Card Registration screen; I get a \"communication with server failed\" error. I appreciate the training I received from HSI, but the app is useless. I really wish I could access the additional info promised on my certificate.",
            "I Got the course through Medic First Aid since 07/ 2020 till now I cannot access the Mobile App as it states failed to communicate with server this is really unprofessional and I see when I read some of the reviews that other Reviewers complained about the same problem year ago and still no respond from the provider ( this is a worthless App) and a waste of time .",
            "At first the app would not let me register ( I think the facility has to update their end first and it is not a high priority). I checked back a year later and could view video that was more effective (automated/visual illustrations are informative). Meanwhile I downloaded \"first aid\" from play store... It was informative as well. I wouldn't think it took a year.. I just didnt bother.. It is frustrating when a business takes your money then individuals working there drag their feet and don't deliver as promissed. (Up to when the collected my money they were more than helpful. KeysToSafety LLC in Twin). I hope this review will help people by knowing they may benefit by giving the certifiers time to prepare for you registration.",

            "Just had a quick look at it and looks and sounds realistic. Love the way it is setup and how it just uses wifi/bluetooth to connect the devices with user friendly interface. Great design especially the ability to create or design scenarios and share them. Best of all it is ad free and FREE! The designer/owner is very generous. This app will definitely make a difference especially in the developing and under developed world with regards to training first responders and resus teams. Thank you.☺",
            "The app is good, but the beep frequency is always changing and I hope that there's a way to turn off the defibrillator panel and settings to change the beep and overall appearance.",
            "Absolutely fantastic as a student Paramedic practicing ALS/PALS, anywhere, anytime!",
            "Best app for the job, I love it. The creator is a super nice guy :)"

            "Thank you for this very helpful app. However, I would like to request a setting to see the notifications in original Korean. The English translations are actually very bad and hard to understand. There are many foreigners (like me) that can use a little Korean. With the option to see the original Korean, we can translate the parts we don't understand by ourselves. Currently, I believe most foreigners will not be able to understand the poor English translations and this could be dangerous.",
            "EDIT: Thank you for responding! Please make it more obvious for what areas I'm getting notifications (like a map), and use regular notifications rather than your custom full-screen ones. ORIGINAL: Ridiculous. I get a full-screen notification of some \"emergency\" every 30min. It turns my phone on in bed and in my pocket and keeps the screen on. And the alerts are machine-translated so half the time they don't make any sense. I'm reviewing this while the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak is happening, but this is complete overkill. The notification \"XYZ location is getting regularly disinfected\" should go away, or be a regular notification, not full screen blocking everything.",
            "Way too disruptive. Translations are not accurate. Annoying to have 15 alerts every 10 minutes.",
            "Great to get translation of messages, but the location service doesn't work. So, I'm getting notifications from the whole country and it's running down the battery on my phone waking it up every other minute.",
            "Good, but there are too many notices. It is interfering with my being able to use my phone."

The scope controls are accurate and appropriately difficult to maneuver. I thoroughly enjoyed the COVID-19 cases they set up as well. The \"Achievements\" need adjustment though. \"No Going Back\" is too sensitive, and will often not award even though I have not backtracked. \"Scope Sprinter\" is virtually impossible for some cases, and would be very unsafe in reality",

Also a little suggestion, could you make it to where you can optimize the games graphics for certain phones bc right now my phone can only run without lagging while going through the airways, and when it lags it kinda makes me run into the tissue giving me a lower score. Anyways, great tool and fun to use."

The explanation is something like \" The respiratory rate of 32 is normal in an infant\". That is not a explanation and is of no value to me. An explanation should include pertinent information. A better and more useful explanation would be \" According to 2009 National EMS standards the normal respiratory rate of an infant should be 25 to 50 breaths/min",
            "Great app. Very helpfull. I love how it explains the rational related to the right or wrong answers. The questions sometimes have typos but the info is correct.",

You get multiple test banks with 120 questions and separate quizzes pertaining to different subjects with each quiz containing 20 questions. Hundreds of different questions organized and easy to use on the go. I would highly recommend.",

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "A great app to use to study and learn heart rhythms. Some minor flaws however, such as missing some rhythms including supraventricular tachycardia, sinus pause, sinus arrest, wandering pacemaker... Also had some flaws where the app identified a rhythm multiple times as atrial tachycardia, yet in the description the criteria for atrial tachycardia did not meet the rhythm presented. Nevertheless, a great study tool for just a dollar. I would give 3.5 stars if I could.",

            "Such an important app with so much potential but its been incredibly badly designed and not tested properly at all. Cumbersome process to sign up - had to scroll for what felt like days in order to select UK from the never ending list of countries - and it keeps telling me to switch on location settings when they're already on! I work in digital so know this isn't user error. Please sort these things out so this can be genuinely useful.",
            "This app has to be one of the most poorly designed and frustrating apps I've probably ever experienced. I have tried to upload a picture of an AED (taken with location services on) and when I click the upload it tells me to select the image to upload and when I do it takes me back to the gallery! Was this app ever tested! It's sister app GoodSam Responder is no better.",
            "Terrible. Not clear there are 2 Apps and all badly described. Eventually found the Alerter one only to be told I have already registered and been sent an email. Never had one and cannot now use it until I register with the missing email!!! Better be careful after choosing a country because if you touch anywhere near that part of the screen it will change your country.",
            "This app looks the business, but it's just too long winded to log in , it asks you for a country when location is activated , it does,nt send activation emails and my app did,nt have a on duty button so I,ve in installed it, you need to sort this out ,you,ve got lots of willing volunteers, and your going to loose them through dodgy tech.",
            "Its a pity its not linoed to the reponder app. Ive got both in addition to being a CFR and the Responder App has my detaiks logged vut ive had to set up a new ac with the alerter and as such it constantly tells me im the closest responder!...time will tell on both. I dont think its advertised enough in the uk for use. Its not great when you have to be constantly logged to internet to use it...unless im mistaken..."

            "A pretty good App. A few updates that would make it a 5 star app would be reducing the minimim timer for amio for 4 minutes, which is consistent with the most common application of ACLS, adding in a section to view the ACLS flowsheets for each pathway (VT/VF, PEA etc.), and a place to write the names of each person in the code (whos timing, doing meds, recording, etc). That would put everything I need in one app.",
            "Good App. Given that current code data feedback can help drive future code outcomes, would respectfully suggest: - CPR fraction calculation - List of meds/defibs/interventions/rhythms in report as a time since code started rather than date/time stamp format (eg, Epi at 3,6,9 minutes) - Option to mannually enter code start time/meds/interventions for codes that started before arrival and CARMA session start - End tidal CO2 value entry Thanks for considering.",
            "Good app but had to give 3 stars becuase cannot select less than 5 minutes for amio. My protocol uses 4 min intervals. Also please add lidocaine as well as change minutes to enter as you please",
            "Please consider adding more drugs to check ☑ please consider All ALS Drugs as this app would have many more uses then? Please do so I know of alot of people who would use this app.",
            "Really easy to use and great for purpose. Would love it if you could add both IV Assess and Other Advanced Airway (for when LMA or iGel is more appropriate) to the Non-drug interventions. Also if you could shorten the lower limit of Amiodarone to 4 mins rather than 5 in preferences it would be perfect! As here in the UK we give amiodarone during 3rd and 5th shock intervals."

This game was inspired by a feeling inherent to humans: sympathy among inmates.\r\n The tragedies that affect the health of people can be personal or collective. Regardless of their type, they have always occurred around the world. Still in the 19th century, we saw the beginning of organized movements of human aids, aimed at health protection: the RED CROSS.

Initiatives around the world have survived to teach first aid measures to communities in general, usually supported by local legislations, especially in Europe and in the USA. Many of these initiatives were sponsored by the UNITED NATIONS, by means of its arm in the health area, the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), an institution that always observes the health systems of a number of countries, as well as the changes that occur in those countries nowadays, largely by means of INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY\r\nCARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) is the most relevant topic in the scope of first aid.

The efforts to do so have strongly increased since the AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION has recommended compulsory teaching of CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) at schools. Another bold initiative was the program \"Kids Save Lives\", with the endorsement of the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), which trains children in CPR in the countries of the European Union.\r\nUsing as a background the eLearning concepts adopted by the WHO’S Health Academy program, this app was developed to be a tool to INSTRUCT the recognition of a cardiac arrest and the first response to a CPR.

We tried to show different random scenarios, as well as use elements to motivate and challenge the players and focus their attention in order to learn the subject. One of the game’s functionality is the non-progression of phases, in case the players choose a wrong answer, so that they memorize the correct sequence of a CPR protocol. The app is not aimed at assessing the learning process of the topic, but it provides a score system for players, in case they choose to check their performance. Although the game is NOT INTENDED TO EVALUATE KNOWLEDGE, it has a score system so that the learners can check their performance.\r\nRegarding the technical aspect, the game focus on the concept of CPR with high-quality thoracic compressions. Although the game is not intended to replace in any way the specific skills in CPR and does not predict the behavior of the player/learner in a real situation, we believe that common language and easy access to this app have potential for being a helpful tool to train more and more first responders for this type of emergency, in agreement with the global campaign \"WORLD RESTART A HEART\"!\r\nJoin and spread this campaign!\r\nPlay the game and save a life in a fun way!",

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

Test sucks - when you select a letter, A B C D, there is often a DELAY and sometimes you have to press the letter again, BUT if it accepts your keypress and goes to the next question, you could answer MULTIPLE questions without even knowing it.  And it says EMR Tutor, then it says FIRST RESPONDER, and these are two DIFFERENT levels of training!  Is this First Responder or is it Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)?  Questions are also quite ambiguous as well.  Seems it's just a waste of time and money.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

It is kind of like a Life Hacks app of human body problems, and what can be done to get rid of it. It is in category form, and has enough info to learn from it; an added plus is it uses little MB. Herbs truly are nature's remedies, have been since mankind began, but the correct doseage and preparation of what is being used must be considered, also.",

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Early recognition of the situation and prompt action by those nearby can prevent the victim from suffocating and avoid a fatal outcome. Choking is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. With the SOSrespira app you will learn how to identify and deal with a foreign body obstructing the airway in victims of all ages (adults, children and infants).  SOSrespira uses videos and diagrams to provide you with a simple guide to learning the correct sequence of actions and maneuvers to resolve cases of choking.  SOSrespira is based on the latest International Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation issued by the   European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), published in October 2015.  SOSrespira could be especially useful for parents, carers and anybody working in the hospitality industry, senior citizen and education centers, all environments in which there is a greater possiblity of witnessing someone choking. Healthcare professionals and teachers can also use it as a support tool in their classes.  This theoretical knowledge is no substitute for appropriate and regular practical training in Life Support, but it could help you to save lives.  This initiative forms part of the accident prevention programs promoted and led by FUNDACIÓN MAPFRE. SOSrespira was designed by specialists associated with the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (SEMES) and Fundación Mapfre.

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul.

Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach.

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "Battle Prime truly blows.... Spent a lot of time (and some money), only to lose a lot of what I worked hard to get. I understand trying to keep the game updated and fresh; but to screw over existing players is not cool. And though I use Wi-Fi, I find it takes forever to get in and at times find myself getting stuck when it's uploading to the next game play.",
            "The game has never been so laggy, it stutters and freeze like never before. There are invisible players spawnkilling everyone, and there's a really annoying bug on the first spawn of every match; I always have to wait for someone to kill me so I can spawn and go help my team. And now, the Sniper Scopes (6x and 8x) shakes way too much, making it impossible for snipers to stabilize their aim right on the target without getting too vulnerable, please, fix this.",
            "Its so GD laggy, before update 6.0 the gameplay network connection flow was almost seamless but now players are shooting me behind GD fuxking walls because hotboxes and whereas my character actually is are delayed and nowhere near in smooth synchronization between the two...please address this network connectivity issue as it makes this and or any game absolutely dreadfully painful to enjoyably play! I've spent so many hours and so much money in support of the development because I've faith...",
            "The newest update brings pay to win significantly, added profile picture fixed stuck on prime choice and its good The bad: is my time to render the game is now very slow my character hasnt rendered completely and it decreases framrate it will he covered when u play the match for a while -Stuck on uncancelable matchmaking -cant start the match making only showed pls wait and it happend contiously as long as i press the \"battle\" botton to start the game",
            "Since the new update came out it's been taking about 10 mins to search for rooms and then 10 more mins to actually start playing; when it finally loads the match is already half way done. Its unfair how these apps for free users theres no care for them at all unless you spending money. I need this issue resolved with the taking forever to load and search for rooms."

        "description": "FrostWire is an easy to use yet feature packed torrent client for Android. Unlike other torrent downloaders, it has a true built-in torrent search, an advanced download manager, music player and a media library. \r\n\r\nAll these features are wrapped into one free app, so you can find what you love easily, download music, movies and video directly to your phone or tablet - fast & with no download size or speed limits, and then create playlists to play your music offline without wi-fi or mobile data.\r\n\r\nFrostWire downloads super fast using a distributed peer-to-peer  (P2P) file sharing torrent network. By splitting the file into multiple chunks and downloading from many sources at the same time, it allows you to download media files as large as high-quality (Flac or wav) full songs or entire music albums, HD movies and 4K video many times faster than conventional methods. As a true free file downloader, FrostWire downloads all file types, so even though it is designed with primarily audio and video in mind, it can also download books, pdf documents, games, software, images and more!\r\n\r\nNOTABLE FEATURES:\r\n✔  True built-in torrent search\r\n✔  Easy one-tap download & seed (share)\r\n✔  Play while you download (sequential downloading)\r\n✔  Open any .torrent file or paste magnet link in Transfers to download any file you want\r\n✔  Select File Storage Location (Internal Storage or SD Card)\r\n✔  Download on Wi-Fi only (preserve mobile data)\r\n✔  Auto-pause downloads with VPN drop\r\n✔  Built-in fully featured music player with gesture support\r\n✔  Built-in media browser (rename and delete your files from within the app)\r\n\r\nFor more detailed list of features see http://bit.ly/frostwirefeatures.\r\n\r\nUSERS NEW TO TORRENTING\r\nFrostWire is a torrent downloader - it is not a content provider. The search results provided come from multiple torrent indexes across the web. If you can’t find what you are looking for, do a Google Search with a .torrent appended to it. Download your .torrent file or copy a magnet link and open it in FrostWire. \r\nThe content availability in search and the download speed greatly depends on your internet connection. For best results use non-public stable Wi-Fi connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT FROSTWIRE\r\nAs an open source community based project, FrostWire has been a quality choice among the best mp3 music downloader apps and torrent clients alike for over 10 years. You can find all Android and desktop versions & download them FREE from our website - http://www.frostwire.com or contribute to the code at http://github.com/frostwire. \r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT\r\nFrostWire is a community based project - your feedback is very important to us! \r\nDon’t hesitate to shoot us an email at support@frostwire.com if you have any issues or feature requests!

        "descriptionHTML": "FrostWire is an easy to use yet feature packed torrent client for Android.

By splitting the file into multiple chunks and downloading from many sources at the same time, it allows you to download media files as large as high-quality (Flac or wav) full songs or entire music albums, HD movies and 4K video many times faster than conventional methods. As a true free file downloader, FrostWire downloads all file types, so even though it is designed with primarily audio and video in mind, it can also download books, pdf documents, games, software, images and more!<br><br>NOTABLE FEATURES:<br>✔  True built-in torrent search<br>✔  Easy one-tap download &amp; seed (share)<br>✔  Play while you download (sequential downloading)<br>✔  Open any .torrent file or paste magnet link in Transfers to download any file you want<br>✔  Select File Storage Location (Internal Storage or SD Card)<br>✔  Download on Wi-Fi only (preserve mobile data)<br>✔  Auto-pause downloads with VPN drop<br>✔  Built-in fully featured music player with gesture support<br>✔  Built-in media browser (rename and delete your files from within the app)<br><br>For more detailed list of features see http://bit.ly/frostwirefeatures.<br><br>USERS NEW TO TORRENTING<br>FrostWire is a torrent downloader - it is not a content provider.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "It's a brilliant story with nice graphic and amazing music. But I just really wish you didn't have to pay to complete the story. You can't go any further into the plot unless you pay money for the full version.",
            "I have some problem. With the latest update, it can't be played because when trying to play some song, the sound is glitchering and beatmap is offset. Please fix this",
            "Came back to the game hoping to have fun but it doesn't even restore my purchases it loads for a fraction of a second then nothing happens. Bought this game since 2018 and this is the first time i felt disappointed in this game please fix this"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different. Plunge into a whole series of adventures, going down into the city subway, traveling to the mountains and national parks on the edge of the city, and venturing through the wasteland, all while shooting your way through hordes of the walking dead.\r\n\r\nRPG AND SURVIVAL\r\nPrey Day is one of the most dangerous zombie survival games full of players who may have different goals and methods of survival - run, shoot, defend, team up, target, and fight real players fighting for survival just like you. Shooting games challenge your skill, speed, and reaction time, and when you're fighting for survival, you'll do everything you can not to die. With both co op and PVP elements, you can communicate and unite with friends, or oppose and kill competitors - the best traditions of MMO and online multiplayer games!",

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."
