Did you know that your genome has a lot to say? Would you like to know more about your DNA? It is easier than you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you had your DNA tested by genetic test providers such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, FamilyTreeDNA (FTDNA), MyHeritage, Genes for Good, Living DNA or Geno 2.0. you have access to a file with your DNA raw data.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenomapp analyzes your raw data file to extract information of interest. We have the most extensive list of conditions from scientific official sources including Breast Cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We also have markers in tumor suppressor genes like BRCA1/2, PTEN and P53.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are tracing your ancestry through genetic testing kits you can also submit your raw data file to Genomapp to get the most out of your data.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** What does Genomapp offer?\r\n\r\nWhen you process your raw data file with Genomapp it associates your genotype with a list of conditions. Currently Genomapp offers the following reports (4 of them are free of charge and 3 are provided upon payment).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Complex Diseases (cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's…)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Inherited Conditions (your genotype markers that could cause monogenic diseases and offspring possibilities of being affected or being carriers of a monogenic disorder)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Methylation (conditions related to genes that play a role in methylation mechanisms like folate or homocysteine metabolism)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Pharmacological response (the most probable drug responses based on your genetic information)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Traits (specific characteristics of an organism: hair color, muscle performance...)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Observable signs (observable physical signs or symptoms associated with unhealthy processes or diseases)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Blood Groups (your genetic markers associated with blood groups)\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Your DNA test provider is not on our list?\r\n\r\nWe are always adding support for new DNA test providers. As well as files from the most well known DTC genetic testing companies such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA, Genomapp supports raw data files with VCF format and files with a specified scheme. Currently VCF raw data files from WES/WGS are not compatible with Genomapp.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Our Database\r\n\r\nGenomapp's search engine allows you to search our database of more than 7000 conditions, 5000 genes and 80000 markers.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Easy to understand\r\n\r\nGenomapp displays information of your DNA markers in a friendly and easy to understand manner.

            "I think I prefer the web site. The family tree doesn't work all the way. It keeps erasing the locations. Also the interface could be better on the part where you add last names and so on. It appears to be blank after you have filled it out and go back to edit so you back out so you don't have to rewrite it all, but it is there after you click. Have it show BEFORE.",
            "The app and results are very interesting to read! I love the relative map/family tree. Unfortunately for now I've left it at two stars because the 'Ancestry Composition' tab has only given me an 'Uh oh, something went wrong!' error message with the option to reload with no results. That was the part I was most interested in so as of now, I'll be leaving my review at two stars until that portion of the app shows info instead of an error. This is a fantastic app/service & I would recommend it!",
            "I downloaded app, hit Register Kit and one get a blank white screen and cannot progress to the registration. I hope the rest of my Eskridge with this kit isn't this horrible. Into the website I guess. Why have an app if it doesn't work, ugh!",
            "Happy and easy to utilize. User friendly. I use the ancestry app as well but have found that this app is much much easier to navigate. The results were very similar just off by some percentage between some countries.",
            "I think this app is wonderful. They keep testing new health and gentics on my DNA all the time. So far they have not found anything related to my heath issues. This does not surprise me. Good app worth the money."

        "description": "A free app (which is the first one of a set) providing an easy-to-use self-assessment quiz. It tests knowledge of the commonest inheritance mechanism or mode, in the UK, for each of 15 \"single-gene\" Mendelian and mitochondrial disorders that may be learned at university.  After taking the quiz, a score is awarded & the correct answers are listed for each question that was answered incorrectly. Due to the overlap between X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant modes, these conditions are classed together in the app as \"X-linked\", as in many current reference sources.\r\n\r\nThe app was created by both Edward and Adam Tobias.

It should be programmed so that if i press the back button it sends me back a page not out of the app! I hope the developer considers this. Thank you for a wonderfull app!"

Cannot create an account, cannot login, must play as guest but only able to get to lvl7 before game starts showing a server error and will not load any levels. Plus there are misspellings everywhere, quiz questions are terrible. Game is played in a tiny area while rest of screen space is wasted... Really unfortunate execution of a cool idea.",

Very bad bug for a very exciting piece of software.",

They have always present as ruby-eyed whites and the steel, which is dominate, only shows up with the Agouti \"A\" IF the rabbit is not \"cc.\" As I understand it, the \"cc\" covers all variations in the genotype. My NZW was proven to be A_ __ cc __ Es_ by crossing with a self aa B_ C_ dd E_.   I would also like to see \"En\" and \"Si\" added. I have Silver Foxes and cross with NZWs at times.

I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

        "description": "Keeping up with the latest genetic testing guidelines for hereditary cancer can be challenging. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry. Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services. Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.",

Hoping this will be a game changer for me 🦓",

It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or \"knock out\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.\r\n\r\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMO was a bacterium generated by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973. Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human insulin was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\r\n\r\nThe rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.",

ID is historically associated with travel medicine and tropical medicine, as many diseases acquired in tropical and subtropical areas are infective in nature. ID specialists typically serve as consultants in cases of complex infections or immunologic issues, and often manage patients with HIV/AIDS and other forms of immunodeficiency.<br><br>In the US, ID is a subspecialty of internal medicine or pediatrics (i.e., an internist or pediatrician trains for an additional 1-2 years as a medical fellow to qualify as an ID specialist and sit for the ID boards).<br><br>There are four main kinds of germs:<br><br>    Bacteria - one-celled germs that multiply quickly and may release chemicals which can make you sick<br>    Viruses - capsules that contain genetic material, and use your own cells to multiply<br>    Fungi - primitive plants, like mushrooms or mildew<br>    Protozoa - one-celled animals that use other living things for food and a place to live<br><br>NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<br><br>This educational &amp; medical application is intended to r:<br>NCLEX-RN<br>NCLEX-PN<br>NCLEX<br>CNA,<br>ANP - Adult Nurse Practitioner<br>FNP - Family Nurse Practitioner<br>A-GNP - Adult-Gero Primary Nurse Practitioner<br>ANP-BC Adult Nurse Practitioner<br>FNP-BC Family Nurse Practitioner<br>PNP-BC Pediatric Nurse Practitioner<br>ACNP-BC Acute Care Nurse Practitioner<br>GNP - BC Gerontological Nurse Practitioner<br>PMHNP-BC Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner<br>PMHNP-BC Family Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner<br>CNRN®<br>SCRN®<br>and also for USMLE, COMLEX, ANCC Certification Center.<br><br>This app is also suitable for  students, researchers, resident, doctors, Anatomy &amp; physiology specialists, nurses and medical professionals and of course Medical lecturers, teachers and professors.<br>Get a better score in your  USMLE  (step1, step2  CS &amp; CK), PANCE, MCAT, DAT, COMLEX,CNA, OAT, NBDE,  or PCAT exam, and the most important  is to fall in love with the material, it worth all the attention.",

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.

Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test.

It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or \"knock out\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.\r\n\r\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMO was a bacterium generated by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973. Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human insulin was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\r\n\r\nThe rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure. Most types of porphyria are inherited from a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.",

        "description": "Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. \r\nCommon allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Allergy symptoms, Allergy management, Allergy causes, Allergy diagnosis, Allergy Prognosis, Allergy Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Allergy Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

        "title": "Hay Fever: Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
        "description": "Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a type of inflammation in the nose which occurs when the immune systemoverreacts to allergens in the air. Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. \r\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk.

        "descriptionHTML": "Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a type of inflammation in the nose which occurs when the immune systemoverreacts to allergens in the air. Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. <br>Allergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and typically do not include a fever. <br>==========================<br>APP FEATURES<br>==========================<br>This exclusive app will help to understand the Hay Fever Guide, Hay Fever Disease Management &amp; Hay Fever Disease causes.<br>Here are features that make this app better than all other Hay Fever Disease apps - <br>-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. <br>-\tEasily Change the page.<br>-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.<br>-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.<br>-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.<br><br>All these features are available for free. <br><br>==========================<br>SAY HELLO<br>==========================<br>Any medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

I like how there are multiple evo branches and not just one. And the fact it has other planets to do multiple branches at a time is just plain AWESOME. And the thought put into the game, occasional updates, making sure it isn't buggy, deserves a 6 star if possible.",

            "This app would be ok, but I rarely find the strain I'm looking for. They need to add a LOT more strains to the database for this to be remotely useful. The quality & type of information given varies widely from strain to strain with no consistency. This is definitely not an app worth paying for.",

I paid the 99 cents to get the premium version and am very glad I did. It's well worth the money. This is the best cannabis app in the play store. Great job developers!😀",

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "The app is really awesome and it's easy to just watching yourself looking funny and I think it is really good to use",
            "I love it for the most part. We have a lot of fun using the face warp and other than the face changing from one look to the next when we do not want it to, it usually works fine. If that is sometjing that could be improved, it would be almost perfect. Perfection would be to allow 2 people to be in the video with different face warp options. That would be nirvana. I recommend this app as it is though. Still so much fun can be had.",

        "description": "Welcome to the Natural Selection Simulation! The Natural Selection Simulation App allows users to simulate natural selection on a population of bouncing balls, or individuals, right at their fingertips! \r\n\r\nUsing a simple machine learning genetic algorithm, this simulation demonstrates how populations evolve towards surviving as long as possible, with the player acting as the selective force against the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works:        \r\n• The simulation works in generations, or rounds. \r\n\r\n• Each generation, a new random population of a predetermined size of individuals (the dots you see in the simulation) is spawned based on the fitness of the individuals of the previous generation. Each individual’s fitness is the total time they survived, and the longer an individual survives, the higher their fitness score will be.\r\n\r\n• Using this fitness measurement and many generations, the genetic algorithm will produce more and more “fit” individuals - individuals that have survived the longest - with slight variations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers may adjust a number of different settings to see how natural selection may shape a population.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimulation Settings:\r\n1. Number of individuals - The number of individuals in the population. This will be the number of dots that players will see and get to tap on in the simulation screen. More individuals may allow for more chances for variability in the population.\r\n\r\n2. Time of each round - The amount of time that passes during each round or generation, in milliseconds.The shorter the time span, the faster players will have to be to tap the individuals.\r\n\r\n3. Background Color - Changing this setting changes the background color of the simulation screen. This may give certain colored individuals an advantage if they complement this color.\r\n  \r\n\r\nGenetic Algorithm Settings:\r\n1. Mutation Rate - The chance that a gene in the chromosome will mutate, or change from a 0 to a 1 or vise versa. Higher mutation rates help against premature convergence to a solution, but at the cost of more variability in the population and greater difficulty of maintaining current converged solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Tournament Size - Tournament size determines how large of a tournament population will be created. Each tournament population is made up of random chromosomes chosen at random from the population (repeats allowed in this app) with the winner of each tournament being selected for crossover. Larger tournament sizes means less fit individuals have a chance of winning these tournaments.\r\n\r\n3. Elite Chromosomes - This is the number of chromosomes, by highest fitness, that are unchanged from one generation to the next. The higher this number, the less variable the population will be from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for time and interest in this simulation app!

The Natural Selection Simulation App allows users to simulate natural selection on a population of bouncing balls, or individuals, right at their fingertips! <br><br>Using a simple machine learning genetic algorithm, this simulation demonstrates how populations evolve towards surviving as long as possible, with the player acting as the selective force against the population.<br><br><br>How it works:        <br>• The simulation works in generations, or rounds. <br><br>• Each generation, a new random population of a predetermined size of individuals (the dots you see in the simulation) is spawned based on the fitness of the individuals of the previous generation. Each individual’s fitness is the total time they survived, and the longer an individual survives, the higher their fitness score will be.<br><br>• Using this fitness measurement and many generations, the genetic algorithm will produce more and more “fit” individuals - individuals that have survived the longest - with slight variations.<br><br><br>Players may adjust a number of different settings to see how natural selection may shape a population.<br><br><br>Simulation Settings:<br>1. Number of individuals - The number of individuals in the population. This will be the number of dots that players will see and get to tap on in the simulation screen. More individuals may allow for more chances for variability in the population.<br><br>2. Time of each round - The amount of time that passes during each round or generation, in milliseconds.The shorter the time span, the faster players will have to be to tap the individuals.<br><br>3. Background Color - Changing this setting changes the background color of the simulation screen. This may give certain colored individuals an advantage if they complement this color.<br>  <br><br>Genetic Algorithm Settings:<br>1. Mutation Rate - The chance that a gene in the chromosome will mutate, or change from a 0 to a 1 or vise versa. Higher mutation rates help against premature convergence to a solution, but at the cost of more variability in the population and greater difficulty of maintaining current converged solutions.<br><br><br>2. Tournament Size - Tournament size determines how large of a tournament population will be created. Each tournament population is made up of random chromosomes chosen at random from the population (repeats allowed in this app) with the winner of each tournament being selected for crossover. Larger tournament sizes means less fit individuals have a chance of winning these tournaments.<br><br>3. Elite Chromosomes - This is the number of chromosomes, by highest fitness, that are unchanged from one generation to the next. The higher this number, the less variable the population will be from generation to generation.<br><br><br>Thank you for time and interest in this simulation app!

Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",

Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

Someone hack my account that i spent goo few ££ on it and totally destroyed. I've got in touch with customer service straight after someone logged in from different device and asked for help so they block them, unfortunately they reply 3days later when everything was destroyed and told me \"sorry comma,we can't help you\"",
            "This is a great game. I am having issues that has been going on for a long time. It looks like they tried to resolve the issues but it still exist. I have 4 different profiles and for all four, any talent points I acquired, the game doesn't allow me to use them.",
            "Its hard to play game specially REFT of LEGEND, the events unbalance the player during matching. Other events is good, the concern is adjast the research time of all research so that weak can balance to the strongeist and so for the player spend money to become strong.",

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",

It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",

The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

        "comments": [
            "Fun game. If there are ads, I never noticed them... completely unobtrusive. And you can literally play for years without spending a penny of real money. The only downsides for me was the ultimate boredom in trying to get the last few spaces on the board, it takes too long. And the weekend events, while giving great rewards, will take nearly every minute of your weekend days to complete. I finally gave up trying to finish the game and uninstalled, but I would recommend giving it a go.",
            "I really enjoy playing the game (only reason why I gave 3 stars), however it keeps coming out of the game and forgetting my progress. Also, things get expensive the further in you go, and I've only been playing it for less than a week! Today by forgetting my progress, it lost me some treasures I would have used to get dragon eggs, which is the only way to advance the game. Ads take me out of the game. Ultimately I'm frustrated with the game and am considering finding something else 😬😒☹️😡😟",
            "The camp economy needs redone. I have to pay gems for everything I work for, and what I receive is not valuable. I opened a level 5 chest, and only received 145 coins and nothing else. The two stars are only there because of the memories when I played this years ago. I know you guys can improve. I don't want to have to switch to a different merge game. P.S. Accidents are fatal. For example, when you're going for a high level item and then merging 3 objects instead of 5.",
            "Such a great game! Graphics are amazing and it's great puzzling fun. One suggestion I have is to make a lock or pinned feature for objects, so they're not as easy to move around if you don't want them to. I also suggest some kind of warning or countdown for when the special events are ending. I like to collect everything at the end, and I tend to lose track of time. I didn't get anything I worked hard for for three days... so annoyed, and it's my own fault but wow. A little notice would be nice",
            "This is a good game to sink time into when nothing else is going on. What I don't like is that purple stars are imposible to get unless you spend real money. I haven't had a purple star drop in more than two months... And I can't justify the cost to buy the gems with real money. It would be nice to have a trade option to purchase the gems with things earned through game play. I'm stuck on some quests because of this \"feature.\""

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Used the app a few times now and seems to live up to what it claims to do. Took random photos, gave me loads of images from Google, Pinterest and any other places a similar photo was on the internet. Gave me explanations of the images. So far so good... Also read out any words it may have seen in the photo. I'd of give it 5 stars. But haven't been using long enough to do so. But liking it so far. Will edit if need be.",
            "Love, love this app!! I work for a non-profit thrift store and I constantly have to look up the value of items. Sometimes the search is off...usually, due to lighting, etc.. Most of the time the item I have taken a photo of is on the first few search page results. Regardless, it is my go to app for items I am unfamiliar with, that lack a upc. Most, if not all of my co-workers are Apple users. When they need help looking up an item, I cheerfully remind them that Apple products are inferior!🤣",

I can't even open the app. It just says thank you for updating . Please try later. I try to uninstall the update, again updated again but nothing really works . Requesting the technical team please help to resolve this issue",
            "I can't search Google by images anymore thanks to this app being integrated with chrome.. So now I can't search by images or find images of other sizes or even fact check websites that are using fake photos. Google's greatest feature besides the collaboration of the entire internet on one search hub was the ability to search the entire internet via one photo. Now thanks to google lens you can't; I'm not sure how this is progress but I definitely wouldn't call it that. Fix this.",
            "It is a great app. Google is always the first to develop such mind-blowing apps. About 5-6 years ago I thought that just as we can search anything on google, there should be a feature that allows us to search not by typing, but by scanning an image because there are many different animals and plants that we don't know about. But i thought that was impossible but nothing is impossible to google. Keep developing such impossible technologies, google. Great app."

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

We've contacted our provider with the problems, only to find we're far from alone! All casual signs point to shoddy processors. Poor reception, incorrect readings showing on screen. Just plain crappy junk. Not worth it!",
            "So I am at this very moment doing an upgrade for this app. When I am doing that I am reading the reviews ( kinda backwards I know) Well every review I have read is saying \"run away from these problems \" how it is working terrible and even that it cant be uninstalled. I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",
            "I'm giving five stars because on all my other phones I've had it works great. But, for some reason this phone the Samsung A01 it asks me to upgrade then tells me it's not compatible, why is this? It's a Samsung Galaxy phone.",
            "This is the phone from hell. Constant error messages so I can't open any unless manage to sneak it in . Now the sound has disappeared unless I put it on speaker phone. This phone was a waist on money just like all the Samsung products I have bought. I am in the hospital and need a phone.",
            "Phone never gets to 100%. Best is 89%. Very frustrating. Other than that it is a good phone. Does more than I ever use it for, though."

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

In this game one thing that i don't like is that the sound of the kart during the moving . Except this all the things are vry nice . I enjoy this game while playing. I love this game.",

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I've played this game before, and I love it. But now that I've reinstalled it, it isn't loading. Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

Sharing a pdf via email didn't work (no PDF attached to email!).  Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!  I've written to the developer to request a direct refund, and will update this review with their response."

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

The notification just disappears.",

EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",

It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves.

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

When I try and go to \"My Page\" I keep getting \"SERVER ERROR (0) TRY AGAIN LATER\" I HAVE \"TRIED AGAIN LATER\" FOR OVER A YEAR! FIX YOU APP! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE TO NOT WORK ON PHONES THAT COST $1,299.99! UNACCEPTABLE! I have had my Note 20 Ultra since release and after contacting Samsung MULTIPLE TIMES. It STILL DOES NOT WORK! UNACCEPTABLE!",
            "Still no resolution over 4 months: Displays my galaxy s20plus warenty is rejected after review using this app. I called Samsung multiple times to have this corrected and they still don't have any idea how to fix this. They say my warenty should not be rejected. This is very disturbing my warenty status still showing its rejected since the beginning of July and no one at samsung knows what to do to fix the samsung members app?? This shouldn't be so difficult to correct.",
            "Why doesn't this app help with finding my phone via chat as my phone can't be reached? I was told to stay online as he was rerouting me to someone that can help, that was 30 minutes ago so I copied it all as no way to get a transcript.",
            "Hardware test may be useful, but I would trust 3rd party software more. otherwise I find this app mostly useless. I said it in 2017 and I'm saying now in 2020.",
            "Many thanks to Samsung for creating such a beautiful app. The Galaxy Store is even more beautiful than the Play Store. But the Galaxy Store needs more big updates. So that everything can be found beautifully in one search."

At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

        "description": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. The causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors.  Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test. Schizophrenia does not imply a \"split personality\" or \"dissociative identity disorder\" – conditions with which it is often confused in public perception.",

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years. \r\nThe cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genesusually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis.

            "This isn't a \"game\", so much as it's a chat room, designed to psychologically manipulate you into spending money on it. In fact, prices for offer bundles will go UP if you buy them. And you'll need them, since they directly buy power. But that power can also be PERMANENTLY destroyed, requiring more purchases. I was in one of the top ten alliances, and I've never seen such tribalistic, immature morons, who banned me without warning for speaking out against spammed alliance-wide messages.",
            "Very addicting!!! i can't stop playing it on my PC with Bluestacks app!!! Soon i will get a phone and enjoy it even more. Becareful for those newbies this is not a friendly game it can be really tough sometimes! Most of the time though i get lag but it's ok i am still able to play it smoothly after a few reload...",
            "Even if you just boubht a $100.00 pack. You will get bombarded with pop ups trying to force you to buy more. So you have to log out and hope it goes away when you log back in. Still happening. It's as if it's a virus. Will send so many pop ups that it will lovk your phone and ir tablet up.",

            "Very interesting to see the details of the air traffic passing nearby. Often very surprising where flights are going to or coming from. Even air traffic 30000 ft above you is covered! One can even track a particular flight around the world. Entertaining and informative. Weekly air news email included. Links to aircraft pictures. Great app, works very well.",
            "I paid for the former Flightradar24 Pro. The paid app was closed down without any warning expressed or otherwise. Former Pro license owners are forced to download the newer versioned app (renamed slightly) and pay again, this time a yearly subscription for most of the functionality already offered in the aforementioned Pro license. The 3 month free trial is an insult to injury and is of no value to me. I don't intend to do future business with this company.",
            "Sometimes it's glitchy and planes or helicopters will \"disappear\" then re appear further on it's course. This rarely happens but I noticed it quite a few times with the Chinooks. Sometimes they have the picture wrong or I've also seen helicopters show up as planes. Over all an awesome app but these are just a few things I've noticed.",
            "I enjoy using flight radar I got the gold membership since I'm always looking at the sky. I wish the AR would calibrate and not force close. My son likes to find a plane the look up the info. I hope it will be fixed soon. Otherwise it's great.",
            "Great app, could be better, but overall, a great app, I use it a fair bit. It should show a picture of the selected aircraft, even of one with a different tail number, most aircraft do show this but some don't."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "It was very helpful and very organised under its own topics and made it easier for me to find something that I am looking for.",
            "Well is is pretty cool and very helpful but a few more resources will do the app real good especially those who want to further thier learning. Anyways the app is very good and i recommend it. Keep up with the good and awesome work.",
            "The day I entered this app and I saw chemistry and the others I was so happy because am a science student it has helped me a lot and I will be more happier if other subjects are included. I could rate it twenty stars if possible .please upgrade the app.",
            "I wish I could rate this 10 stars. This app is amazing. Although, I do wish you could add Climate Zones in one of the cology. I'm in 5th Grade, & I'm learning about Climate Zones and Pressure. I do love this app. You guys have done an amazing job. When I'm studying, I put on an app with rain music to calm my emotions so I can focus on studying. I love both apps. Both of these companies did amazing. I can't believe how many years I didn't look up this kind of stuff before. Thank you again. ^.^"

Edit: the game has never been glitchy, but recently I was playing and suddenly the game got stuck and my phone turned off after that, the music if the game was still playing and my phone wouldn't turn on for a while. The problem is fixed now, but I'm still worried about entering the game. Does the game have a glitch or a virus?",

I would give it 5 stars but recently everytime I watch a video for lives/bonuses it crashes my phone. Not just the app but my whole phone, I have to restart it. This never was a problem until recently. every now and then I find myself needing 1 or 2 extra turns and attempt to watch the ad... Everytime I am instantly reminded why I should not even try.",

            "It wasn't designed to do phone calls. Amazing how the decoder can automatically select format. Creates interesting effects when the encoder is played through an amplifier. Would like to try this in a large reverberation sized room. Working best when at lower volume not loud enough to bounce off of walls. Scottie DX is actually the only mode that doesn't smear my profile picture. I've got this encoder and decoder set on 3 of my devices. I've sent my profile picture to myself through every single mode this pair can do. Looking forward to the day I can actually use them with a radio or even home phone.",
            "I love this app, but I've had a slight problem this last time I've installed it... For some reason the save button is greyed out, and the share button doesn't seem to do anything. Is there any reason this would be happening that I'm just missing? I had to save my last image via screenshot, which isn't ideal, so I'd rather be able to use the default save feature :) I'm on Android 10 on a Nokia 7.1 Thanks for the great app!"

            "EDIT: there needs to be some kind of confirmation when spending gems. I just magically lost 25 gems and I don't know how ORIGINAL: It feels like the game is designed to keep non paying players poor. Many of the garden quests are not possible to complete without paying, and to skip them, you have to pay a month's worth of gems. The events are the same: impossible to complete without paying. The game itself is fun, I just wish they didn't make it so difficult to move forward if you don't pay",
            "Do not, I repeat do not! buy the golden pass. Its a rip off. Even though it says golden pass at each season, you can only use it for one season and then you have to repay to be able to keep using it. €5,50 is much for an option that would stay. But it's unbelieveably expensive for something that only works for one season... I either want my money back or I want to have the feature unlocked forever. Your choice Gram.",
            "Very addicting. But if i may make a suggestion on a useless feature? The screen lock is pointless, and the button is in a poor location. Having a screen lock feature on a game that requires you to move the screen doesn't make sense. But if it needs to be in the game, i suggest relocating its button. I' ve turned that thing on so many time just because an item appears in the bottom of the screen close to it. But other than that very good game",
            "I wish I could get more compasses by watching videos more often I would totally watch them to play more levels. It allows me to do it sometimes but in other games it is unlimited ad=more play, instead I have to wait a whole hour to get another compass to keep playing? That doesn't make sense. But I do love the game, it is addicting and fun to merge stuff. I just wish I could play for longer.",
            "So far a very fun game, althoughIhaven'tbeen playingbut about one week. The only downside that I have found so far is that if you want to play & collect items, you better bring your credit card to the table. The only way to get what you need and/or desire is to pay for it. All items (eggs, buildings, plants, etc) go up in price every time you expand or purchase it."

        "description": "Haemophilia, also spelled hemophilia, is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery. Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness. There are two main types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene.[6] Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to not enough factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to not enough factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood for its ability to clot and its levels of clotting factors.",

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or \"knock out\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.\r\n\r\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a genetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMO was a bacterium generated by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973. Rudolf Jaenisch created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a mouse in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human insulin was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. Genetically modified food has been sold since 1994, with the release of the Flavr Savr tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. GloFish, the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 salmon modified with a growth hormone were sold.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create animal model organisms of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through gene therapy. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\r\n\r\nThe rise of commercialised genetically modified crops has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the controversy surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. Gene flow, impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and intellectual property rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.",

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "The game is very much pay to win at the higher levels and every update brings a new way to squeeze players for money. With that said, if you are careful and keep your level relatively low, you can have an amazing time for no money. Gameplay is fast and fun and there are more heroes than you could ever possibly master. I'm not even sure what genre this is. It has LoL elements, idle elements, management elements. I enjoy playing a little bit every day.",
            "Broken, Frustrating, Expensive, Overrated, Dilapidated. Are words that go along way to describing this faulty game. Very early game is fair, but it's all down a very sheer cliff thereafter. This is the most over controlled and forward progess limited game I've ever played. And the money that's required for progress. You could literally spend a thousand dollars and be wondering how that money bettered your game. Plagued with bugs. Customer service just adds insult to injury. Oct 2020",
            "I used to love this game until they changed the style and graphics of the game, they took out several things and changed everything. The game is still good but it didnt need to be changed style wise because it doesnt suit the game itself when lots of old players see all the changes",
            "what the heck is doing the devolepers adding these garbage \"puzzles\" to the game, its just another idle/merge heroes game stop pretending that is a puzzle game, its not a good addition, its garbage i get nervous watching these screen and waiting like an idiot to get some basic heroes, played 5 mins and i dont want more.",
            "A simple game, very playable, which would appeal to a lot of ppl, atm loads of glitches, today its completely bugged, unable to play due to screen not launching, still waiting after 5 hrs, for DEVs to tell us something or give us an update."

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",
            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "Great game play! There's always something to do to keep you busy whether it be trying to breed a weekly or monthly dragon, completing clan quests(once you get to that level), or participating in one of the frequent events to win food, coins, dragons, and more! I can honestly say, with maybe a little bit of shame, that I can play this game 6 or more hours a day and not get bored!",
            "I love this game, I've played when I was younger but, now I remember the game and realize that I love it! There are so many adorable dragons! When you need to feed the dragons I just don't want to because they are cute just the way they are, but since the developers thought about that, they added the Fountain of Youth that made things 100x better! I find no problems with the game no glitches, it never kicks me out. Keep up the great work Gameloft! :)",
            "This is one of my favorite games!🤩 But you may wonder why I didn't rate it five and just four instead then..🤔 this why 1. Search bar doesn't work for me when I search up dragon's names 2. I am an active player these days, but when I get dragon eggs, it sometime takes 30 seconds, but then some take 21 hours!!!🥴🥵😵 3. I can't pay for VIP or for more gems, so can you please put more ways to get gems, cause I know how to get them, but can you add a way to get gems faster if your in a rush?",
            "Minus a star because im playing this game on a phone and finding it more difficult to see anything because there are too many icons on the screen. Also when you have an egg go onto where it hatches, if you have that dragon already then there should be some way to delete it without waiting for the hatching, which could be anything up to hrs to days.",
            "It's very frustrating that I am in the middle of a task or battle and I get kicked out of the game and I loose what I have done. Also it takes to long to log in. And must of the time hat I log in i get kicked out immediately. I have complained several times and they suggested that I didn't have enough memory in the device so I bou6a memory card of 120gb . And It improves for like a week, and then when back to the same issue. I play the game to get relax and enjoy not to be frustrated. Help me."

        "description": "The pancreas is about 6 inches long and sits across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body.\r\n\r\n            Pancreas Conditions\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 1: The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the pancreas’ insulin-producing cells. Lifelong insulin injections are required to control blood sugar.\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 2: The pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. The body also becomes resistant to insulin, and blood sugar rises.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, usually including the lungs and the pancreas. Digestive problems and diabetes often result.\r\nPancreatic cancer: The pancreas has many different types of cells, each of which can give rise to a different type of tumor. The most common type arises from the cells that line the pancreatic duct. Because there are usually few or no early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is often advanced by the time it’s discovered.\r\n\r\nPancreatitis: The pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged by its own digestive chemicals. Swelling and death of tissue of the pancreas can result. Although alcohol or gallstones can contribute, sometimes a cause for pancreatitis is never found.\r\nPancreatic pseudocyst: After a bout of pancreatitis, a fluid-filled cavity called a pseudocyst can form. Pseudocysts may resolve spontaneously, or they may need surgical drainage.\r\nIslet cell tumor: The hormone-producing cells of the pancreas multiply abnormally, creating a benign or cancerous tumor.  These tumors produce excess amounts of hormones and then release them into the blood. Gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas are examples of islet cell tumors.\r\n\r\nEnlarged pancreas: An enlarged pancreas may mean nothing. You may simply have a pancreas that is larger than normal. Or, it can be because of an anatomic abnormality. But other causes of an enlarged pancreas may exist and require treatment.\r\n    \r\n          Pancreas Tests\r\n\r\nPhysical examination: By pressing on the center of the belly, a doctor might check for a mass in the pancreas. He or she can also look for other signs of pancreas conditions.\r\nComputed tomography scan: A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the pancreas and abdomen. Contrast dye may be injected into your veins to improve the images.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic waves create highly detailed images of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an MRI that focuses on the pancreas, liver, and bile system.\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Using a camera on a flexible tube advanced from the mouth to the intestine, a doctor can access the area of the pancreas head. Tiny surgical tools can be used to diagnose and treat some pancreas conditions.\r\nPancreas biopsy: Either using a needle through the skin or a surgical procedure, a small piece of pancreas tissue is removed to look for cancer or other conditions.\r\nUltrasound: A probe is placed on the belly, and harmless sound waves create images by reflecting off the pancreas and other organs.\r\nAmylase and lipase: Blood tests showing elevated levels of these pancreatic enzymes can suggest pancreatitis.\r\nSweat chloride test: A painless electric current stimulates the skin to sweat, and the chloride in perspiration is measured. People with cystic fibrosis often have high sweat chloride levels.\r\nGenetic testing: Many different mutations of a single gene can cause cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing can help identify if an adult is an unaffected carrier or if a child will develop cystic fibrosis.\r\n   \r\n       Pancreas Treatments;\r\nInsulin  Injection\r\nPseudocyst drainage\r\nPseudocyst surgery\r\npancreatic cancer\r\nPancreatic enzymes\r\nPancreas transplantation",

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

This knowledge is existed in the form of principles such as Panchamahabhuta, Tridosha, Prakruti, Triguna, Saptadhatu, Kriyakaal and so on.

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

        "description": "Nowadays even a child knows that human-made foodstuffs have special ingredients – food additives. They are flavors, emulsifiers, food colorings, preservatives and other substances which enhance the flavor and add required qualities to products. More and more often we hear about components which are made of genetically modified organisms.     \r\nTo classify food additives within EU countries a special numbering system was invented. It has been working since 1953. Each food additive has a unique number that consists of the letter “E” and a special classifier code, which is used all over the world. A healthy diet is the basis for our well-being that is why it is very important to have detailed information about components of the aliments. \r\nSome food additives, which are considered to be harmless or whose negative impact has not been proved, actually are very dangerous. Some of them can fall into toxic components under certain circumstances (at a temperature of a human body or because of gastric juices). Harm of some synthetic additives appears because of chemical reactions with other foodstuffs. \r\nAccording to statistics, a person on average eats 5 kg of food additives every year. Most of such ingredients we use in our diet without any worries: sugar, vanilla, salt, gelatin, bicarbonate of soda, vinegar, B-Carotene, ascorbic acid, pectin, egg white and other food additives. Any way, it is important to remember that only you are responsible for your life. So while shopping you need to follow certain rules.    \r\nWhen you buy aliments, you must examine labels and keep in mind that the list of ingredients in unhealthy food is longer as far as it contains more food additives. Try to avoid products with too extended storage periods. It is obviously that they have too many preservatives. Unhealthy food contains a lot of different food additives and GMO and, in comparison to wholefoods, it is much cheaper. Unhealthy food is easier to buy as far as you can find it in fast food restaurants and supermarkets.   \r\nFor each food additive an acceptable daily intake was established. If it is exceeded, there can be negative effects. Scientists, who work in the healthcare sphere, suppose that the decrease of wholefoods and superfoods in our diet along with the increase in artificial additives and GMO may cause the growth of such diseases as cancer, obesity, diabetes, depression and asthma. Specialists recommend not allowing children, aged people and those, who have an allergy, to consume food additives. A healthy diet and such ingredients are incompatible as far as they do not contain enough vitamins and may become allergens for some groups of people.       \r\nUnfortunately, wholefood nutrition will be less available in the future. The population of the world is growing whereas the number of organic farms as well as the amount of fertile land and natural fertilizers is decreasing. Eating cheap unhealthy food instead of expensive wholefoods makes our diet rich in aliments but poor in necessary ingredients. \r\nOne of the best solutions for this problem is to include into the diet high-quality dietary supplements – vitamin and mineral complexes made of natural components. By using certified supplements, we can have optimal health and decrease the risk of becoming sick because of the unhealthy lifestyle and foodstuffs. Only we can decide what to do with our life: to improve our health, body and live longer or to leave everything as it is. People who really care about their health try to balance their diet to be sure that it contains all necessary vitamins, minerals and ingredients which are recommended by the scientists who collaborate with the world leaders in manufacturing of dietary supplements.",

            "I love Dragons, so this is very enjoyable for me. Still learning the game only level 86 i think, so still a lot to do to master the game. Update 10/16/2020 I am now over level 110 my dragons are getting stronger and accomplishing more in the gane, it just keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth 5 star rating and if it were possible 10 star. Keep up the great work everyone!!",
            "I'd rate this game 5⭐, but everytime I try to watch an ad (for extra rewards), it keeps saying \" No ads available \" , then after about 3 minutes of try to get the ad to play, the game crashes, and have to wait another 2 minutes for the game to load again...If this issue gets fixed I'll change my review to 5⭐, but as it currently is, the game is practically unplayable. (Suggestion: if there's no ad available, you could have it auto give the rewards. Rather than having the game constantly crash.)",
            "This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics! The game play is easy to learn and use. I like that the dragons look lifelike versus other games where the dragons look more like a cartoon. I only gave 4 stars because you can't use a dragon's special weapon until a certain criteria has been reached in the game, which I haven't been able to reach yet.",
            "I've been planning this for a couple of months now and I find it fun and easy to play even though I cannot buy anything with cash because Google locked me out of my account. It's super addictive and got some of my friends and family to start playing too. I only need to spend about 20 minutes or so 3 or 4 times a day and I in the top 40% of the server.",
            "Extremely fun BUT... one of the most expensive games if you want to try to support the devs. If things were cheaper I'd actually spend some money, but 25 + a month for auto play and no adds... no one time purchase options. 30+ for battle passes... The high prices forced a bad rating for a great game. I will probably search for another game to support. Dropped to a 1 star, legion chat always disappears leaving you with no idea about who has asked questions or anything. Pathetic devs."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Best framing simulator i ever played. It needs some awards when played to certain stages. For instance when you get up to $1000,000 in your farm account. But I beleave the developers cannot make anither farming simulator that can match Farm track 14. Can I get the company e-mail address?",
            "This game is very good. And I have played many other games and didn't like them,but I would like a for the vichles to be fix at a place if they hit sumthing like a rock and I want the game to be able to play music while I'm playing it. May you please this. GIANT",
            "It's a fantastic game, and I'm very addicted to it. It's a great introduction to FS, and it's sold me on buying the sequels. But! This version is so old that there are a number of bugs that mean it's not suitable for new hardware. In the version I have, seeds and fuel never run out. Also, sometimes a section of your field turns a different colour and won't turn back. If GIANTS continue to offer this game for new devices on the app store, they need to clean it up and make it work correctly.",
            "This is very best game of farming but some problem in this game the some tractor are not unlock they are uinlock with rral money of high rate so u increase the rate of tractor but not unlock with real money. I like handle in game in game setting the handle is not aavible before the handle is avalible.so u change the setting.",

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off.

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

            "The game is great. My problem is that I had a glitch where I couldn't complete a game.I matched everything but no win. I sent a message and told them and mentioned that I lost 300 coins playing this game 3 times. They fixed it, but I guess they don't reimburse for their glitches. 2nd thing, now they have a survey going. 200 coins. I could use it. Takes 15 minutes. It finally says thanks you you now have the 200 coins. Well I didn't get it. Tried again. No coins. Asked for help twice. Nada",
            "Love this game, however since yesterday on every game I play, once I've cleared the board completely I have to use one of my help options to end the round. Not sure if this is a glitch or what. I hope this gets fixed, or I will need to stop playing and delete. I am updating my review, the previous has been fixed and now my game back to working as normal. I really appreciate the fast turnaround on this. Other than that, this game is fun, and relaxing... love it.",
            "It is fun, some stages more challenging than others. Sometimes items get stuck and you need to use a cheat to get them quick enough not to lose your bonus. Only thing is, there's a piggy bank that's full that you can't use for anything but you can unlock a bigger piggy bank but why??? There's no purpose to it??? I would love the ability to do a shared board with a friend.",
            "I like the game but like others I have issues: 1) ads which can't be muted. I don't care for the political ads, wish to mute. 2) Items on the sides being hard to grasp, agree. I started using a stylus. Easier. 3) I still have no idea what the coins are for as most things in the game cost money, not coins; I'm not sure why the amount of coins reset either, what's the point? I haven't reached the level some have mentioned where there are \"ghost\" pieces though. That'll likely change my rating.",
            "Originally I gave this game 5 stars. I have cancelled that because I now only get times in the 5 minute range. Gets very boring now. Same time continually. What happened? Also agree about too many adds. Not enough time given to actually playing the game. More time spent waiting for ads to go by. I never watch them. Fixed the 'same time' problem. Deleted game for a while. Then downloaded it again. Did this a couple of times until the times changed. OK for now anyway. Problem Ads the same."

Veins can swell for quite a few reasons, though they most commonly occur when there is something blocking them or hindering proper blood flow. Common conditions that can cause swollen veins are pregnancy, heredity, weight, age and thrombophlebitis (an inflamed vein with associated blood clot). \r\n\r\nYou will likely notice them bulging near the surface of your skin, and sometimes causing you pain. In most cases you can reduce the swelling at home. Make sure you take action against swollen veins quickly — if you leave them alone they will likely get worse.",

The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",

            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",

On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "This is a fun game, and I used to love playing it a lot, but they've decided to become obnoxious with the ads to try to annoy people enough to buy the ad free version. Each game session is two minutes. There is now a \"halftime\" in each one to force you to pause and watch another ad in addition to the ones before and after the game. I understand the need for ads, but as much as I have enjoyed this game, this move isn't making me want to upgrade. It just makes me want to find a different game.",
            "This is a very fun app once you learn how to play it i mean I get 500 usually and sometimes 700 and 800 but my higest score is 950 and trust me it's not easy. one thing I would like to add to the game is a rankboard like who is the best player and who us the second best player. Please community of the game answer me and fulfill my wish. thx for making this fun game",

They even feel the need to interrupt your two minute game with a half time ad. If you like watching ads, get this game, since that's all there is to do. Devs, you did a good job of screwing things up. Way to go.",
            "The game is simple fun and addictive... one drawback is that after the update, my minion count just keeps growing uselessly as i be teached the maximum level ul in all the powerups... its kindof killing the spirit of the game.. Also when we turn into that humongous minion ball, it tends to get stuck inside buidigs , in corners etc and doesnt move for quite a while. This costs precious game time..."

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

No option to select country before loading contacts. When contacts are loaded, they all become Indian numbers. Why?

Some social media pictures and details are fake. I will rate after upgrade.",

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",

After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",

            "Hilarious results. The app does not pretend to make accurate predictions about your appearance when you grow old, but the results will make you and your friends crease themselves. And this app does not have intrusive ads or make you upload your photo to the devs' servers. It's free too, which is worth a mention. Combine the results with the sister apps bald booth and fat booth for even more fun. I just hope the devs will continue to update the app so it can still work with newer Android versions",
            "Doesn't do much other than gray hair and wrinkles, but I cant complain all that much considering that its free and has no ads.",
            "This app is false. It doesn't show you how old you will be, it just adds more wrinkles and makes your face 'fat'. Dissatisfied with the app....",
            "Only shows a wrinkly grey screen when you upload or take a picture in the app. I couldn't get it to show any faces and the one it did work for uploaded the photo sideways, so it didnt work anyway. Its terrible!! I used to use this app on my ipad and it was so much fun and worked like a charm, but now it doesn't work at all. If it would have worked, I would have considered the fact that it worked well the last time I had it, but since it doesn't work at all, I have to give it a 1 star rating.",
            "I downloaded this app, and it is seriously just adding a couple lines for wrinkles, and they are basically just trying to get you to download this app because the title makes you believe that you can see what youll look like in a couple years, but the results are surreal. i am 12 years old, and even this in my opinion, is just trying to trick your brain"

But still my google is not working and getting same notifications even after cleaning with this app. It has happened with many people.. I would have checked the review before I install it..",
            "Well,I'm not sure about this app because is keep on appearing on the phone ,and asking me to clean up my apps or my phone will freeze or cancel, and I also keeps on cleaning and cleaning after another cleaning but still saying the very same messages ,so what now?",
            "Suddenly something popped up and said \" install or ur phone will freeze\" I pushed cancel but it directed me to play store, I installed it and used it, but it's nothing more than my own phone's device care. The only difference is that this annoying app is full of ads.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nThe causes are not clearly understood, but both environmental and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental risk factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress. About 85% of the risk is attributed to genetics. The condition is classified as bipolar I disorder if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and as bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed. If the symptoms are due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present similarly include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia and substance use disorder as well as a number of medical conditions.

Then, with 128 Gb sd-card, or cloud storage, it would be unstoppable!",

            "It works, bit I find so much is pointless to a basic user, I don't need scientific mode on 100% of the time, and I'd like M+/- buttons instead of having to mess with copy and paste. Give us a basic and scientific button to toggle between the modes.. PS to the people complaining about the clear, press and hold the backspace button and it will clear",

I don't use the scientific operations, so looking at them all the time is visual clutter. VERY ugly app. Lastly, in all that clutter you can't give us a memory +/recall key OR a simple clear/all clear key. You know, keys that are found in just about EVERY calculator anyone has ever used EVER. /smh",

No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

            "Sept 28, 2020 MetroPCS by T-Mobile changed to the Scam and Spam app . Updated January 6, 2020 from 2/25/19 Absolutely the best $2.50 a month ever! No more Telemarketing, scams, or annoyingly winded people. Blocks Telemarketers! This particular app has worked for me over a year now. Still working like a charm. Ha, Make it year 3!The best company in the States for service is MetroPCS by T-Mibile. Service, connection, and the people are great. X 💚🐢",
            "I have appreciated this name id blocking unwanted calls until today when it blocked a contact of mine. Now I'm wondering how many other contact calls have been blocked without knowing...I hope this glitch gets fixed!!!",
            "I like it very much, however the 1 thing I don't like is the list of numbers stay forever. Also the old way 1 could check a number if one got thru. Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",
            "I'm so glad I have this! With so many scams I've gotten where I dont want to answer any calls but now, stopping them has been easy. Although, I wish it included text messages as well.",
            "I am a maintenance supervisor and I'm busy all through the day and it's really nice to not be getting a lot of unnecessary phone calls to interrupt me while I'm doing things I truly appreciate this app and all that it does for me thank you so very much."
