            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I really like this app and have been using it for 5 years. It's worked perfect with the INR log, dosage amounts, daily reminder, and doctors appt reminder. All are great!! However, recently upgraded my Android phone and the daily reminder to take my meds doesn't work. Very disappointing!!! I wish it still worked as it did on my old Android. Otherwise, I would totally recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful app. It does everything is needed to carry on with the anticoagulant therapy. Better than other similar Android free apps. I only rated 4 stars because the \"export to csv\" function doesn't work on my Huawei P Smart.",
            "Great App but there's a few things. We need a way to back up our info in case of failure, or phone changes. We also need a way to delete and edit our inr logs once they are entered. If i make a mistake i have to delete the app and start over. That's annoying as heck! Also allow us to write in dates rather than scrolling.",
            "I have a home INR meter. While I had a INR diary I had no way to generate reports. I like üòç being able to get reports.",
            "I really like how convenient this app is. I love the options of dosages, as being on Warfarin/Coumadin as they can change frequently depending on how strict you are with your diet. I know how diabetics must feel having to manage something without as little error as possible. I can't seem to find any other app like this so it obviously is in my honest opinion a great resource to log your dosage. I hope you all stay happy and healthy! Much love! <3<3<3 Isolated Anomaly"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nAnal itching\r\nOne or more hard, tender lumps near your anus\r\nAnal ache or pain, especially when sitting\r\nToo much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.\r\n\r\nInternal Hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nBleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement\r\n\r\n\r\n========\r\nSymptoms\r\n========\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:\r\n\r\n1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,\r\n2) Anal itching,\r\n3) Pain in the anal area,\r\n4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nThese include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nWith internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by \"regular skin\" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:<br><br>Anal itching<br>One or more hard, tender lumps near your anus<br>Anal ache or pain, especially when sitting<br>Too much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.<br><br>Internal Hemorrhoids<br><br>Internal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:<br><br>Bleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement<br><br><br>========<br>Symptoms<br>========<br><br>Hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:<br><br>1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,<br>2) Anal itching,<br>3) Pain in the anal area,<br>4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.<br><br>These include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. <br><br>This is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.<br><br>Internal hemorrhoids<br><br>With internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.<br><br><br>External hemorrhoids<br><br>External hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.<br><br>External hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by &quot;regular skin&quot; and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. <br><br><br>*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!ü¶â‚ô•Ô∏èüåû‚òÑ‚ö°üíöüíôüíúüí• P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over ¬£10 for an entire year!)"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

        "description": "Estamos asistiendo a innumerables progresos en el √°mbito de la Hemostasia y Trombosis, que abarcan desde avances en la gen√©tica de los estados trombof√≠licos y hemorr√°gicos a nuevas pruebas diagn√≥sticas, algoritmos de decisi√≥n y estrategias terap√©uticas, entre las que irrumpen con fuerza los anticoagulantes orales de acci√≥n directa (ACOD) que van, a corto plazo, a revolucionar el tratamiento de la trombosis, y nuevos factores para el tratamiento de coagulopat√≠as cong√©nitas, en particular hemofilias A y B, que permitir√°n aproximarnos a una medicina personalizada. No exist√≠a hasta ahora un manual que recogiera de manera sencilla, clara y con formato atractivo aquellos aspectos de la patolog√≠a hemost√°tica que interesan a los cl√≠nicos.\r\n\r\nEn esta obra, de ineludible car√°cter formativo y lectura obligada en el campo de la Hemostasia y Trombosis, se revisan los aspectos m√°s relevantes de la fisiopatolog√≠a, diagn√≥stico y novedades terap√©uticas en el √°mbito de la trombosis, principal causa de mortalidad en nuestro medio, as√≠ como de las di√°tesis hemorr√°gicas cong√©nitas y adquiridas. En ambas situaciones el tratamiento moderno y actual debe contemplar la individualizaci√≥n de todos los pacientes, lo que ha venido a denominarse ‚Äúmedicina de precisi√≥n‚Äù.\r\n\r\nEl objetivo de esta obra es proporcionar los conocimientos b√°sicos y facilitar la pr√°ctica cl√≠nica que ser√°n de gran utilidad para un abordaje personalizado de la patolog√≠a hemost√°tica y tromb√≥tica. Se ha puesto especial inter√©s en el formato, que incluye numerosas tablas, figuras y algoritmos que examinan con detalle la fisiolog√≠a de la hemostasia, aspectos pr√°cticos del laboratorio, patolog√≠a de la hemostasia primaria, coagulopat√≠as cong√©nitas y adquiridas, estados trombof√≠licos y patolog√≠as tromb√≥ticas, con un apartado dedicado a la hemostasia en la pr√°ctica cl√≠nica, con inter√©s en diversas especialidades m√°s all√° de la Hematolog√≠a: Cirug√≠a, Neurolog√≠a, Pediatr√≠a, Obstetricia, Intensivos, etc.\r\n\r\nUn aspecto novedoso es que se difundir√° no solo en formato app, sino tambi√©n a trav√©s de formatos impreso y online.

        "descriptionHTML": "Estamos asistiendo a innumerables progresos en el √°mbito de la Hemostasia y Trombosis, que abarcan desde avances en la gen√©tica de los estados trombof√≠licos y hemorr√°gicos a nuevas pruebas diagn√≥sticas, algoritmos de decisi√≥n y estrategias terap√©uticas, entre las que irrumpen con fuerza los anticoagulantes orales de acci√≥n directa (ACOD) que van, a corto plazo, a revolucionar el tratamiento de la trombosis, y nuevos factores para el tratamiento de coagulopat√≠as cong√©nitas, en particular hemofilias A y B, que permitir√°n aproximarnos a una medicina personalizada. No exist√≠a hasta ahora un manual que recogiera de manera sencilla, clara y con formato atractivo aquellos aspectos de la patolog√≠a hemost√°tica que interesan a los cl√≠nicos.<br><br>En esta obra, de ineludible car√°cter formativo y lectura obligada en el campo de la Hemostasia y Trombosis, se revisan los aspectos m√°s relevantes de la fisiopatolog√≠a, diagn√≥stico y novedades terap√©uticas en el √°mbito de la trombosis, principal causa de mortalidad en nuestro medio, as√≠ como de las di√°tesis hemorr√°gicas cong√©nitas y adquiridas. En ambas situaciones el tratamiento moderno y actual debe contemplar la individualizaci√≥n de todos los pacientes, lo que ha venido a denominarse ‚Äúmedicina de precisi√≥n‚Äù.<br><br>El objetivo de esta obra es proporcionar los conocimientos b√°sicos y facilitar la pr√°ctica cl√≠nica que ser√°n de gran utilidad para un abordaje personalizado de la patolog√≠a hemost√°tica y tromb√≥tica. Se ha puesto especial inter√©s en el formato, que incluye numerosas tablas, figuras y algoritmos que examinan con detalle la fisiolog√≠a de la hemostasia, aspectos pr√°cticos del laboratorio, patolog√≠a de la hemostasia primaria, coagulopat√≠as cong√©nitas y adquiridas, estados trombof√≠licos y patolog√≠as tromb√≥ticas, con un apartado dedicado a la hemostasia en la pr√°ctica cl√≠nica, con inter√©s en diversas especialidades m√°s all√° de la Hematolog√≠a: Cirug√≠a, Neurolog√≠a, Pediatr√≠a, Obstetricia, Intensivos, etc.<br><br>Un aspecto novedoso es que se difundir√° no solo en formato app, sino tambi√©n a trav√©s de formatos impreso y online. Un segundo aspecto es que la edici√≥n tendr√°, asimismo, una difusi√≥n internacional, con distribuci√≥n en los pa√≠ses de Latinoam√©rica.<br><br>En esta edici√≥n han colaborado especialistas de reconocido prestigio, con experiencia cl√≠nica y docente, lo que contribuye a la calidad de la obra.

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "When I run AV, it says \"risk found\". Doesn't tell me what the risk is, where it is, what to do about it. So your AV just finds the problems but doesn't do anything about them? According to the developer, it's supposed to tell you which file is affected but it has told me nothing but that a \"Risk Found\"... that's it, nothing else. Not helpful and it doesn't get rid of the problem, so the app remains useless. Still one star.",
            "AVG gives really comprehensive virus protection for free. OK there's ads which I'm prepared to put up with and actually some are interesting. AVG also offers extra protection (which isn't free) like secure VPN but the costs of the extras don't seem to be that much. There's also an AVG deep clean app which is free and that's also very good. All in all I'm very happy.",
            "All services I have ever used with AVG have run smoothly and performed as advertised and promised. I am using the free service now b/c of pandemic budget issues. I eagerly await the time that I can enjoy and feel even more secure and protected with the bundled pay services. Customer service over the years I have used AVG services has ALWAYS been warm, professional, , and acutely knowlegable about their products. Impecable service apprecited beyond compare = THANK YOU!!!",
            "One of my apps sends a PopUp with a message that my service provider UICC is not valid every 3 minutes!!! Very annoying! But otherwise, my phone works perfectly well, and nothing is wrong with the UICC. I purchased AVG antivirus pro, and AVG Cleanup, and NONE of them identified the issue nor fixed it! I am angry and i want my money back!",
            "i only got the app maybe 10 minutes ago but wow! i had some sort of malware on my phone that kept sending me to my settings and telling me to turn install on, if i did turn it on i got pop ups telling me to enter my bank details and if i tried to turn it off again i got sent to my camera, which made it almost impossible to close. anyway i got the app, did a scan and within 1 minute it found the issue and got rid of it. couldnt be happier!!!!"

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT üëçüëçüëçüëç",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 üíé and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ‚ô°"

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 √©nergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Recurrent coagulopathy may persist for 1 to 2 weeks or more. Patients who experience coagulopathy due to snakebite should be monitored for recurrent coagulopathy for up to 1 week or longer. During this period, the physician should carefully assess the need for re-treatment with CroFab¬Æ and use of any type of anticoagulant or anti-platelet drug.\r\n\r\nHypersensitivity Reactions: Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with CroFab¬Æ. In case of acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, discontinue infusion and institute appropriate emergency treatment. Patients allergic to papain, chymopapain, other papaya extracts, or the pineapple enzyme bromelain may also have an allergic reaction to CroFab¬Æ. Follow-up all patients for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reactions or serum sickness (e.g., rash, fever, myalgia, arthralgia).\r\n\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ‚â• 5% of subjects) reported in the clinical studies were urticaria, rash, nausea, pruritus and back pain. Adverse reactions involving the skin and appendages (primarily rash, urticaria, and pruritus) were reported in 12 of the 42 patients. Two patients had a severe allergic reaction (severe hives and a severe rash and pruritus) following treatment and one patient discontinued CroFab¬Æ due to an allergic reaction. Recurrent coagulopathy due to envenomation and requiring additional treatment may occur.\r\nFind out more at www.CroFab.com, which includes the full Prescribing Information.

But when I return to my files I still saw those empty folders in which Ihink aw viruses and worms. I've deleted them how many times yet they are stilling coming back hours after. Dunno what to do anymore huahua. Gon change my review if you guys have seena and responded. Just wanna know if it's your app or it's my phone already. Thank you!",
            "love this app it found a virus that was causing all kinds of problems, cleared my cookies and cash and run a system check on everything! Yesterday my Android phone was hacked and it was just behaving horribly and this app restored me to normal . I was thinking I might have to get a new phone! But it's running like a dream now. I am so grateful and recommended it to everyone",
            "Good app actually it scans and detects any harmful apps or virus that is Installed into your device without your knowledge .i am facing a problem an app or something i don't know it simply installed into my device and it affects me working on my device it suddenly opens chrome whenever i turn on my data.even if i uninstall it again installs itself.it would be really helpful if you can make this app to prevent any app or software installed into the device without the user's consent."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ‚ù§Ô∏è I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap üòâ ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "The app is so cool. It reduces all kinds of lag, extends duration of battery, cools the CPU and also makes the device more faster, but the only problem is about the ads, there is a huge amount of add showing in the app when we use it, that can be cleared by making the app premium by paying some moneyüí∞, still I like it so much, also recommend all of you to install the app as it is very helpful for all the devices.",
            "This app is amazing! I dont even have the premium version and it frees up so much space. But it does more! It can secure your privacy, cool your device down, and save your battery! And those are only the main ones. There is three more. And if you have premium there will be no adds and two extra things it can do! 5 STAR EASILY.",
            "I actually used my tablet storage cleaner to clear cache first (which only detected about 30mb), then this app, which detected 1.11GB! Then, after clearing it and boosting RAM, my tablet was way faster. Plus, the CPU cooler was legit too! Thanks to the developers! I'll consider recommending this to my friend, who's game is lagging, making it unplayable.",
            "I LOVE this. The only bad thing is the amount of ads, but you can skip them and X out of them so they arent a huge problem. It cleans your storage, making you less laggy/slow. Royale high in roblox is close to not lagging at all for me, when it used to lag so much that I couldn't even play! This helped SO much. I totally recommend this! Thank you to the person that made this!",
            "It even lags the most before I play the game it lags a little after I installed this, it lags the most!, I'm expecting like the ads, what app is this?!! Causing virus through phone!!? who made this app?!!! That developer is idiot making an app but don't know what to do! Oh my god!!! I WILL REPORT THIS!!!DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU JUST LIKE MINE! I have to keep doing the hibernate, CPU, cleaning things till 2 MINUTES WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!! MY PHONE JUST DIED!!!"

            "This is a very well designed app. It's clean, uncluttered, & easy to use. I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5‚≠ê) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5‚≠ê! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

I choose 3 stars because I'm observing the behavior of the app. I am looking forward someday that I'll rate this app at the highest rate possible, if the stability is okey. Thanks, I hope I can help others that are experiencing just like mine.",

Currently I'm only running the free one and I'm using it on my phone and my computer both desktop and laptop I will be upgrading soon I had the full paid for but finances were tight and I had to cancel that and go with free and it is doing an awesome job thank you so much",
            "Fingerprint app-lock fails on Galaxy S20. Went through Kaspersky support, used the debug version, sent them the results. Then they gave me another version to try that also failed. Now they say they're working with Samsung to sort this out. So I put a 3 star review up describing the problem. Now I get a review response to contact support to investigate the problem... That's poor, someone hasn't checked. Downgraded to 2 stars. 6 months on, fingerprint app-lock still isn't working.",
            "Bought premium for an year (Sept 2020 to Sept 2021) but it won't show up even when I had it on my Google play subscription. Edit: I contacted the support team and the solved it within a matter of hours. I'm really glad and grateful for the services and dedication towards the customer. Thank you!",
            "Really great protection that makes me feel safe! I do have two complaints which is why I deducted two stars. For one, there is a lack of variety for Internet security - why is Firefox not on this list? This I can learn to deal with but I much prefer to use Firefox. The second issue is with the app locker service - it makes me feel really secure, but every time I unlock, as soon as I start scrolling or if a new tab shows up within the app, I'm forced to re-authenticate. It's really not usable."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! üòâ",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user ü•≤",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

Hence, selecting too long a screen timeout is not advisable.",

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",

The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery.

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Though, I used the PC version of AVG and it prevented some attacks. So, I think, it is effective. Still, there is an actual inconvenience: \"Web Shield\" stops working from time to time and user has to renew its permission to work in the settings of the mobile phone (Sony Xperia). P.S.: Thank you, I followed your advice.",

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enoughü§îüôÑü§¨üò§üßêüôÉüòíüò†üëéüëà",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off ü§î And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself üòä Jackie"

            "I used to love playing this game. Unfortunately they have changed it too much. I remember I could spend 10 coins and get 10 balls. Now its 35 coins for 5 balls. Now I only get 5 lives and if I run out of lives my options are of course to pay or to wait. I play this game to relax and can play it for hours. Now with the new heart/life system I can't. I'm very frustrated and disappointed. I'm on level 1445 but don't know if I'll keep playing I appreciate you responding to my review but until I see",
            "This game was fun. However over the past several updates they made it more and more about the money than the players. The game itself is fun. It used to be unlimited lives, but now it's to a heart system. This way you have to pay or wait to pay. The piggy bank is awful. It's just another way for them to make money. The fact that you used to get 5 balls free for watching an ad was fair. Now for 5 balls you pay 35 coins. All signs point to the developers only caring about money.",
            "Another piggy bank cash grab. I am going to uninstall because I refuse to pay for my own progress. If it wasn't a cash grab, why can't you make it to where I can open the piggy bank by watching ads, just like it gives me the option of watching a video for extra moves? Seriously, come up with an idea of your own and maybe it would be better. What a waste of time",
            "My mom and I, love this game so much but the new heart system is so frustrating. This is the only game that she plays over and over again. Please consider getting the old system back is kinda hard to explain to her why her game needs to wait for a while to play again cause she's getting old.",
            "Used to love this game, but the recent changes have made it more frustrating than it's worth. The constant ads, pop ups prompting purchases between each level, the constant piggy bank pop up were a little annoying but still manageable. The last introduction of hearts/lives has made it not worth the play at all. I understand the desire to monetize things, but it was taken too far. I normally buy the full version of the apps I like, but don't see an option for that with this one."

Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each. I would've skipped the download button and tried remembering which other App is the REAL free one and doesn't use credits. Don't download, find other free one.",
            "I accidentally un install the apps, I tried to install again and log in my email address but I can't log in even if I click the forgot pass word. Please help me. This is my second time, before you don't take an action about my problem on this apps. All my credit I didn't use it. Waste of time.. grrrr. I will rate your apps if you fix my problem.",

            "All my saved work disappeared with the latest update. Other than that I really like the app. But why put that much time into it if everytime the app updates all your work is gone.",
            "This would be a higher rating, except that there is no more save button. When I tried to save my finished page, it saved from only halfway done. Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ‚ù£Ô∏è the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best üòÄ",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "This game has a lot of potential but after a while it gets quite boring. Don't you think that when you have the buttons with the stripes an the arrows that if you merge them together you could clear the board or some type of explosion that adds points to your score. Come on people use your imagination we all have one. If I come up with something as simple as the explosions with the straight buttons I'm sure you could come up with something a lot better since you're supposed to be the experts",
            "I've always enjoyed this type of connect games and, to me, this is probably the best one out there. You can spin a wheel once a day for free to win bombs, scissors, ect. to help if needed. Youcan use gems to buy spins and it's very easy to get gems. There's no limit to how many times you can spin the wheel as long as you have gems which is great!Some levels are difficult but you can always get extra time if you watch a 5 to 30 second ad. Try it. It's a great game!",
            "My \"go to\" game for winding down and chilling out. Rarely do I find myself frustrated, and the ads are tolerable and, quite often, convenient! My teenager laughs at my longevity/commitment.....Level 1141 and climbing! There's just so many spots waiting to be connected!!! ...................... Side note: I usually keep my volume off while I play, but sometimes I thoroughly enjoy listening to the spots ‚òÜ \"PoP\"!‚òÜ when connected........and the fireworks! ü§£ü§≠ü§ì",
            "I don't like that you run out of gems so fast and that you only get 2 free ones when u watch an ad its just to much work to keep pressing the button and watching ads over and over again just for two gems.. I think we should get more gems and more time on the clock.",
            "Please help! When playing a game, after a few minutes, everything freezes and can't make anymore moves.... do i perhaps need to do an update or something? Love the game and don't want to start from the beginning again. All help will be appreciated Thank you."

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",
            "Used to be fun and my favorite time passer. Now it's just so overwhelming buggy and full of ads. The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",
            "The ads freeze so the game must be closed and reopened. This happens after every turn and your version of ad-free is a $10/mo subscription? If there's a cheap, one-time, ad-free purchase....I'm not seeing it. Fix this please. I'd be more than willing to pay a very small one-time fee to just remove ads.",
            "I cannot view the ads to gain more coins, BUT am over run with ads after each move. Some dont finish, so close game. Have repeatedly complained to no effect. Will not buy coins for power ups! People complain about creeps lurking - don't answer them, then when finished game, block them. Turn volume off to block loud music or noise."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing.

I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüëç‚ô•Ô∏è",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "This app is absolutely incredible. It has so many drawing and you can create your own drawing. On my second day I colored 5 drawings already. This app is just fantastic. I always get new awards. However, there are so many adds. Which I do not like. I absolutely hate it. Although, all the adds do remove but you have to pay money. It was a fantastic app. I really love the app. I would be shock if anyone rated this a one star. I just cannot believe that.üíôüíôüíôüòÄ",
            "Really good, I was having problems with a other paint by number and it got a little boring so I decided to get this one. This never gets boring for me and has so many puzzles. I also like how it is divided in different genres, it makes it easier to find what I want to do and find specific things that may be hard to see. There is just one problem: I allowed my camera and It still won't let me make custom art, very sad but it's only one problem which I can get from other pixel art apps so it's ok.",
            "Honestly, this game has to be one of my favorite apps in my phone! It just makes me feel so creative and happy. When I'm a little bit sad or maybe just bored, I play this game and it just makes me feel so happy! Also, just to point out, when the other pictures, like, is kinda special, you can just watch an ad and its free! Well, despite the other option which is to get the premium, its fine! So, I am highly reccomending this game to kids, teens, adults, every age!",
            "I absolutely love this game. There are many kinds of drawings to color . I love that the game has different categories to chose from. If you want to color a special drawing it takes 1 add to get it, Well for me it does. I color at least 15 drawings a day. This game is a calming game and a relaxing game. This game is a great game to play in quarantine too. THE END",
            "I love this game, dont get me wrong. Though there is this issue that happens quite a lot when I'm coloring in pictures. I'll be filling/coloring in a picture of something and then there will be a color missing. And I cant find it even when I click the bulb to find it it cant, and then I cant finish the coloring page. Hope you can fix that. üòê"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",

Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.üòä",

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ‚ô°",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ‚ú®",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ‚≠ê‚≠ê. Best of luck for your game. üòä. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",
            "Giving this a 5 stat just because google reeeeeally wants me to delete the app. Whenever I get a notification about deleting apps to make room daily motion is always near the top of the list, despite the fact there are apps I haven't used in almost a year near the bottom. It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

        "comments": [
            "i love the idea of call screening and the transcriptions are useful but the blocking engine is too basic and not really effective. It allows incoming calls that spoof the first six digits of my number to ring my phone. It also lets through incoming calls for which the screening transcription contains the words \"ssn\" and \"fraudulent transaction\". Come on, guys. Time to step it up.",
            "I don't know what is wrong with this app everytime I answer the call my phone screen goes all blank. I can't talk to anyone putting the phone in speaker. It's happening since past 1 month. My cell phone is working just fine but this app is creating a problem. Fix the bug please. I'm still not getting this app. After doing clear cache its still not working. Screen goes all blank",
            "Basic functionality doesn't work. Line is busy and then I end the call and it won't stop beeping with the line is busy sound. Doesn't matter if I quit the app. Only restarting the phone fixes it. Loved this app when I had a pixel phone and was happy to see it available to download with my LG V50 but unfortunately I'm going to have to uninstall this app and use the stock app until it's fixed.",
            "So far so good... Except for a minor issue: i usually register my contacts with the country code associated to their number. However, when I receive calls from them they are not recognize as my contacts, and instead their number is displayed WITHOUT their number's country code. I didn't have this issue with the Samsung default Phone app.",
            "All of a sudden the \"voicemail\" option has stopped. When I get a call the voicemail does not register the call. I have to call my phone number to see if I have any messages. I called google fi twice and neither can help me fix the problem. I have to now wait for a supervisor to send me an email! While I am stuck not receiving any voicemails messages!! This is so frustrating!"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",

After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section onlyü§îü§îü§îü§î"

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps.

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

Bring back move minutes as an option when setting your goals.",
            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

        "description": "Hematology, also spelled haematology, is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. \r\n\r\nThe commonest reasons for referral to the general clinic are the finding of abnormalities on the blood count or symptoms experienced by the patient that the referring doctor thinks may be caused by a disease of blood, bone marrow or sometimes the lymph nodes.\r\n\r\nThe kind of abnormalities in the blood count include the following.\r\n\r\n    Anaemia - low haemoglobin or red blood cells\r\n    Leucopenia - low white cells\r\n    Thrombocytopenia - low platelets\r\n    Polycythemia - too many red blood cells\r\n    Leucocytosis - too many white blood cells\r\n    Thrombocytosis - too many platelets\r\n\r\nMany people referred to these clinics worry that they have a cancerous illness. This will be true for some, but the majority of patients referred to the general clinic do not have cancer.\r\n\r\n Essential Haematology is widely regarded as the most authoritative introduction to the subject available, helping medical students and trainee doctors understand the essential principles of modern clinical and laboratory haematology for nearly four decades. Now in its eighth edition, this market-leading textbook introduces the formation and function of blood cells and the diseases that arise from dysfunction and disruption of these processes.\r\n\r\nBeautifully presented with over 300 stunning colour illustrations, the new edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect recent advances in knowledge of the pathogenesis of blood diseases and their diagnosis and treatment. This new text:\r\n\r\n    Describes disorders and diseases of the blood such as the various anaemias and white cell disorders, leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma, as well as bleeding and thrombotic disorders\r\n    Incorporates the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification of haematological neoplastic diseases\r\n    Reviews contemporary application of multiparameter flow cytometry, DNA sequencing and other technologies in evaluating patients with suspected haematological disease\r\n    Discusses the therapeutic use of chimeric antigen T-cells, mono- and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of intracellular signalling pathways and direct orally acting anticoagulants\r\n    Includes sections on blood transfusion and the haematological aspects of systemic diseases, pregnancy and the neonate\r\n\r\nEssential Haematology is a vital resource for all students and trainees, and a valuable reference for practicing specialists wishing to update their knowledge.\r\n\r\nHaematology discusses up-to-date knowledge of the pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, management and treatment of a wide range of blood and bone marrow disorders in a concise and user friendly style. It presents essential information for everyday use and teaching, as well more detailed scientific background for more in-depth reading, accompanied by thoughtful referencing. \r\n\r\nThe clearly illustrated full-colour figures and charts demonstrate key facts, and are supplemented by numerous high quality photomicrographs of blood cells and tissues. \r\n    New sections reflect advances in the specialty, e.g. knowledge gained from new generation sequencing, latest anticoagulant drugs, diagnostic laboratory tools, and treatment strategies\r\n    Superb four-color illustrations and photomicrographs of blood cells and tissues throughout\r\n    Companion website featuring figures and tables from the App",

            "This is a cute game, but there are WAAAAAY too many ads! I don't need them forced on me in such an aggressive manner. Everything you do is another ad. Update: I bought the full version advertised, \"ad free\" of the game and you STILL are forced to watch ads. I immediately went for a refund and there wasn't an option. Do NOT let these people steal your money! THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM!",
            "Love the game. Although it has way to many ads, after every round there is a ad. I hate this so I'm giving it 4 stars. Please fix this, and I might come back and change my answer. Besides all the ads this Is a great game so I recommend anyone that likes tricky games and dosent mind lots of ads this game Is for you. But again please fix the ad problem it is getting on my nerves! But I will not delete this app. Thank you",
            "The ads are manageable if you keep your wifi off, and the graphics are cute. The biggest problem is that it just becomes tedious after a while. 2 choices for every level, sometimes logical and sometimes meant to be funny ... but it jusst gets boring really fast.",
            "I uninstalled immediately. After literally 3 seconds of playing a portion of the game, there are two ads: one of which you need to wait 5 seconds to skip, and the other is a full 30 seconds, all after 3 seconds of game play!! Absolutely obnoxious. And then it repeats.",
            "Clicked on only 2 things in the game and was hit with 5 full length adverts. This is just advert city. You have no time to enjoy the game, its just random tap and boom you're bombarded with adverts. I get that adverts fund development but there needs to be a trade off. In this case there is almost zero game and just one advertisement after the other. The hubris of calling this a game and then asking you to rate it after only 2 interactions with the game is staggering."

            "Great Game, Ridiculous Pricing! I downloaded Paint By Numbers recently and found that I really enjoyed it. They make painting these fun, there's a rewards system and achievements. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it... that is until I saw the pricing. $5 a WEEK!! Or the option for $70 EVERY YEAR! No thanks. Game is great, but pricing model killed it.",
            "Hi, I really really love this game the best, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because when i went today to check my library which is were I finished the pictures, the pictures won't show colored they would show blank and I tried to color them back but when I left the app and came back all my pictures that I painted are blank again! So please fix it then I will enjoy it and give a five star overall I recommend this game its so relaxing and its addictive omg I love this app.",
            "Very relaxing way to spend a few minutes. Pick your pictures right and they come out brilliantly. Only thing I had to change was the highlighter to a brighter one, couldn't see the grey one. Other than that it's great, and addictive, once you have done one and seen what it looks like you immediately want to do another. Finished ones can also be downloaded üëç",
            "Had to factory reset my phone and now all of my purchased gems are gone as well as completed pictures and purchased collections. No ok at all. Further to my review, ive contacted support numerous times to no avail. Ive done everything asked of me, provided sufficient answers to all questions and provided evidence. Ive been fobbed off and told \"we will look into it\" and \"we will fix this\" over and over but nothings been fixed. Either give me my gems back or refund my money. Con artists & thiefs!",
            "I really love this app. The pictures are super awesome! I can however only give 3 stars for now cause everytime I finish a picture it wants to play an ad(which is fine) if the ads worked. With the ads not working I can't move on to the next picture. If that was fixed I would give 5 stars no prob. But I can only do one picture and have to close the app. If you made it so I can continue even if the ads don't actually play I would also give 5 stars. Thanks for your time! Much love."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

        "comments": [
            "My experience with Word Connect is fairly limited. I`ve only played it for about 8 hours, much less than the 30 - 40 hours I'd normally play a game before giving a review of it. I like the bonus frequency, amounts of the bonus', and variety of characters. Games are challenging and hints are very helpful. Well, off I go to hopefully complete another level. Good Luck everyone.",
            "Too many ads and some that run too long. Been playing this game for over 4 years and it used to be my favorite game, but now it is my least liked game due to the ads and too many game competitions. It needs a feature that allows players to communicate with one another or the developer via chat or something similar for either questions, concerns, assistance, etc. I don't mind ads, but not ads that take up more time than playing the game. Wish the developer would consider these changes.",
            "Love it. Very challenging. I play everyday. Gets a little tougher the more you play. In love with this game. This game is very mentally challenging. I'm addicted. can't stop playing. Got my husband playing with me.Great way to pass time and I'm learning new words. I am truly addicted. Still playing everyday. Can't wait to beat the daily challenge. So much fun. Joined a team. Adds alot of fun.",
            "I like the game, mostly. But, I often spend twice as much time waiting for the ads to run than I actually do playing. And, a lot of the ads run consecutively. For things I have no need of (seriously, a man having to watch women's?!?) Plus, there are a lot of words that don't seem to be in the dictionary. The scoring is strange. Often it's by the word, not the complexity. So you get more points for 5 3-letter words than for 1 7-letter one. But it's fun, and can be challenging.",
            "Good most of the time but frustrating in a couple of areas. For example, it won't accept all words, only those that have been predetermined. There are glitches in the reward system ... too often you get a message saying 'Oops, there was a problem' and you don't get the opportunity to claim your point rewards. In team challenges there are usually 20 out of 50 people who contribute absolutely nothing but still get equal rewards. If you can overlook these, then it's an entertaining game."

I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "Cool! Now whenever I whistle my phone says \"Come on!\" in the challenging voice of Duke Nukem. Easy setup and it sounds just like the classic video game. (My own sound file). You supply custom sound file. (It comes with six sounds.) I'm gonna get the ad free once I pay a few older bills. *Sigh*. Edit: now I changed it to say \"Gin!\" So I respond with such half-witty repartee as \"at this hour?!\" No, whisky!\" And \"Alright, I'm sending you to Betty Ford\" if it's a song that keeps hitting the note.",
            "It isn't always reliable and you am have to be able to whistle but apart from that it's fine theirs not many ads in the slightest and it makes finding your phone a lot better plus it let's you customize if you want a flash or vibration on your phone when it plays.You can also make turn it off so when your on your phone you can prevent it from going off. So over all it's a 4 star for me",
            "Just downloaded this app, so far its good. My only concern is the option to choose your own sound. It doesn't show all the sounds I have in my device. It only shows the ringtones for google hangouts. Is there something wrong with my phone, or it's the app itself?",
            "Great app. It can hear my whistles from the other room :). However, it reacts to other things too such as squeaky doors, birds singing (NOT whistles), and my dog woofing. I set the tune to meowing so now my phone meows wherever I go lol.",
            "This app is so cool! The only problem is it doesnt work sometime when I whistle. I have an idea for this app just yell what word that you typed in that would be cool! üòÖüòÖ"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

            "It's a pretty nice app. Loads of information and tons of links. The guys are great. If they run across something that you like, they will email you or text ya. They we're just letting me know about Tom's Place. It's really good too. Kinda slow at times but it's not bad. I would definitely recommend üòä this app.",
            "I am tired of this app crashing, repeatedly. I will be in the middle of an interesting article and the app closes and restarts. I even deleted it and reloaded it and it still happens. To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

Not Cool, INTERUPTING MY GAME PLAY TO SHOW AN AD AND THEN CHANGING MY POSITION ON THAT BOARD TO MAKE ME LOSE THE BOARD WHEN I WAS 2 MOVES FROM WINNING?!?! Well, THAT gets you UNINSTALLED! If you're considering downloading this, PLEASE BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, some are just being KIND! This is the WORST I've ever seen. There are other games like it, try one of them & avoid this LOOSER! UNINSTALLING!!!! NOTHING BUT GREED!",
            "Love this game. I see people complaining about the ads, but I really haven't experienced this. I know an ad pops up each time you lose a level and have to restart, but if you're smart, you can avoid actually \"losing\" any level. I'm not going to divulge this trick since it would interfere with their ability to make money, but come on people. Even if you do have to watch an ad between attempts or levels, it's a free game with THOUSANDS of free levels. Calm down.",
            "(ed) 10/27/20... still enjoy playing will leave rating as is unless issues are not resolved. Last 2 weeks off & on unable to watch ad to cont., with level which is an uninstall issue. Lost a level & had to repeat but I think fluke. 1rst issue not fluke. Have put a little $ in for extra balls & to say thanks. Hope to continue playing// Its addicting and I enjoy it. Ads are short and are really good. Tried several games from the ads.",
            "This game would be great comic it doesn't give me a stupid commercial every single time I pause like other games have done, it gives reasonable commercials reasonable times‚Ä¶ but it breaks down. I have tried to undo a move twice in the last couple of days, and not only does it take away the gems I ever earned, but it doesn't undo the move, moves the blocks down and completely screws up the game even more. Extremely frustrating. Other than that, though, it's a great game.",
            "The game is simple easy and better than any other. The ads aren't too Terrible, you can close them out instantly when you get an ad to go to the next level or forfeit the level, if you want the free rewards, you'll get an ad the you have to watch in full, but that's understandable. I highly recommend, and I've had this game for over a year and a half. It saves data if you create an account which has proved incredibly reliable since I've had to get multiple new phones. Great game."

        "title": "Prey Day: Survive the Zombie Apocalypse",
        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

I'm not saying that this problem is on you guys end but, when it logs me out of an online match I lose money each time and can't get it back. I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",

Pls fix this. :) And if I can give the developer 1 suggestion, it will be customizable snare, drum, crash location. by the way, Iam using Samsung galaxy s9+",

            "I love the way Baby Bus apps have back to back 30 second forced adverts that my 2 year old gets to watch. No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE."

App cannot launch properly so it closes. I try to launch again but theres the same scenario all time. Im on Huawei P30 Lite. Message to developers: please undo last update if you can. Now many people cant even open the app. I was on level 1410, its a pity to lose all this progress. This game is so cool and I dont wanna put it in the garbage.",
            "I loved the game until the new update, I was at level 1171. The new update made it so I can't even open the app anymore! I may never play again because I don't want to loose my levels. Also the controls sometimes glitch and if I try not to complete the line all the way around the obstacles it'll mark it as if I've touched it. The game is pretty enough for what it does.",
            "Brilliant gameplay, my go to game. I was on level 482 before I updated. Now, the app won't even bloody open. I have been trying to open it for the last week or so but still no hope. I've tried every solution under the sun, except for deleting it because I don't want to lose my place in the game. Nevermind I guessü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

Nice casual no brainer albeit not difficult at all, no matter what the game ads say. Edit:app keeps stopping at start,will not run anymore. Since there was no update to the app I suspect the Corona terror related rubbish that was put into Android.",
            "This game was my favorite game but after its latest update(the change of the icon of the game) the game had stopped working and is just taking my phone's storage and whenever I try to open this app it does not open and it shows that color fill 3D is not responding or it shows that color fill 3D keeps stopping and we always get 3 options 1. Write a feedback 2. App info 3. Close app and even after sending many feedbacks in which the same problem that is occurring is written but still it's the same"

The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.üëçüëçüëç",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "This game is horrible! There is ads for EVERYTHING!!! You have to watch an ad after every level, and the graphics are absolutely disgusting! I would never recommend this game. I did one piercing and I am uninstalling!! If I could rate this game lower than one star, TRUST ME!! This would have a negative 1000 star rating! Never again!",
            "This game is an absolute joke. To many ads, and even if you pass on the upgrades it will still play at least one ad after every level some times more. You spend more time watching ads then you do playing the game. I've only done 3 piercings and I will be deleting this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",
            "This was a huge disappointment the game itself is a great design but after doing 2 people the game wigs out and makes it where you cant see anything so you have to close the app and reopen it , and not to mention when you're in the middle of doing something and then an add pops up not before or after no in the middle. Needs alot of work",
            "Everything is very far off from where your finger actually is on the screen. You have to watch ads to do literally anything in the game, and, on top of those ads you have to watch to progress, you also get random ones too. I get that they need ads to make money, but this is ridiculous. Why have games come to this?",
            "Yeah everybody's right about this game is way too many ads nobody should get this game cuz there's so much else you can't even play the game I got past the first episode then there's that and then I couldn't afford that because the video was so long and then I had to watch another ad before I picked it a different ear piercing and another add another another"

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.üôèüôè",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

Some social media pictures and details are fake. I will rate after upgrade.",

Then I had to subsribe for $14/monthly to upgrade it to standard membership. Would have been cheaper and easier if I had just purchased total protection from the website. I hope unlimited number of device protection is still available",
            "I'd give them ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê because the app itself generally works fine! But... there is a failure that irritates me a lot..! The MS App lock feature..! I understand that applications should be locked, if I want them to be locked. But come on... it is a bit too pesky when you have to unlock them every single time, over and over, even if they were minimised. Please, add a feature/possibility to make some apps stay unlocked in session. Thank you.",
            "I've tried the rest so I can say with experience that this is the BEST mobile security app on Google Play Store! Unlike the other apps their malicious website detection is superb. It actually detects suspicious sites before your browser can visit them & blocks you from even going there. Competitor's apps only detected 50% of malicious sites. VPN feature needs improved security & IP masking because the Plus hefty fee increase doesn't justify it.",
            "Can't access mcafee account after updating app and had no help from developer, except got redirected back to the app after which my code was regiven, only to be told by the app it wasn't valid and I payed for a year to be able to use the full app service, no other option to renew for another year was given either, what is the developer doing, give me the run around, so I give 1 star until problem is resolved. Thanks.",
            "This app is amazing. I brought a new laptop and I got a McAfee Multi Device Subscription for up to 3 devices. I loved this app because of its simple interface, real-time scanning and anti-theft. I can also backup my contacts and media in it. It improves my machine performance and provided me high security.

            "Such a shame, could have been a really cool puzzle game, but there's just far too many ads.. It's literally ridiculous.. I get that you guys have got to make money.. But forced adverts after almost every completed level, plus a banner at the bottom. Is just pure overkill and greed. I played about 6 or 7 levels and just gave up.",
            "I don't normally review games based on their ad count because devs need revenue, but this one needs it to be considered. The game is simple, which is exactly what I signed up for, but a simple game combined with an ad after every 2 second puzzle is just frustrating and discouraging. It feels like a cash grab. The game itself, while incredibly easy, is alright. I was looking for a good stimulating timewaster, and I ended up with an ad exhibition with breaks sometimes. No thank you, I'm deleting.",
            "It's fun, but the ads are ridiculous. You take 5 seconds to beat a level, then have to watch a 30-60 second ad. There should ALWAYS be more gameplay than ads, NOT the other way around! Also, it's very obvious that some patterns get reused over and over, either that or, after a certain number of levels, they start over from level 1.",
            "The idea of this game is pretty cool but the puzzles are really easy and sometimes they repeat. There are ads after each puzzle, if you're really lucky, sometimes you get 2 before an ad. The good thing is that they made the ads skippable but they're still just as annoying, especially because the puzzles only take seconds to complete. If you can handle the ads then this is a good time waster but if you're looking for something stimulating then keep looking cuz they dropped the ball on this one.",
            "A fun enough expirence because ot was free. I personally disconnect from wifi because I read from other reviews that there were too many ads. But I was able to cycle through all of the levels in under 15 minutes. And they REALLY aren't very hard. I know these games are probably meant to pull in children but I'm a 20 year old man and this really didn't cut it for me :/ didn't have glitches or anything but still a sad expirence. It never really elevates in difficulty."

Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",

Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",

All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

You can be in and out in seconds. 10/09/20: The app is now demanding a 5 star review, and keeps opening Play Store instead of letting me exit. This will soon greatly effect this rating. 10/16/20: Program forced me back to my rating to give a rating.",
            "Every time I run the junk cleaner it always tells me some random number of gigabytes. So I'll run it and assuming it freed up that space it should reflect on my phone's memory. However, checking it in the settings didn't show any change. I go back to run the junk cleaner a second time and again it tells me the same amount of gigabytes can be freed up and the same exact thing happens over and over. Not sure it's really doing anything other than getting you to watch ads.",
            "Yes,it searches the unwanted files and videos and deletes it but...sorry to say that it doesn't clear cache memory that it claims to do. After cleaning your phone with it you can go to settings option to check cache removal condition, there you find it has not been removed. Otherwise app is good.",
            "This is best app. Before I install this app my phone memory always decreasing. It always shows low storage. But after installing it my phone memory is saving. My mobile is Samsung Galaxy core 2 duos with internal memory about 2 GB from which about 300 to 500 mb is free. Before it was <100 mb. This app is also <10 mb in size. How this app works? When we install any new app or update any app then in 1 minute message come CLEAN. Select it. Then do junk clean. This will remove all unwanted apk file",

            "I'm addicted to decor games and this is one of my favourite...BUT why are there so many ads? I recommend this to my siblings and they had already uninstall it because of the ads! extra ads than any other games! AND I've been on level 549 and WHY do i need to finish upto level 630 just to unlock the next room? it becomes boring and tiring ! I'm üëå this close to uninstall it though I'm addicted to it and the designs are great! it becomes more boring and boring !!!!!!!üò¢",
            "It is ok but I don't like the way you have to do a puzzle as without them you would be able to enjoy the game more. Some people do like puzzles but there should be a choice button. Also we should press on things and change it without doing puzzles not just the first few.",
            "This was actually enjoyable (too many stuffed animals for it to feel like you were designing for real), but the thing that kills it is non-consensual ads. It would be very easy for them to up the bonuses that you get for watching ads, but they decided not to go that way.",
            "Fun game. I gave four instead of five stars only because it glitches too much on my tablet. I finished the kitchen and now it won't connect to server. Darn. I really enjoy the game play.",
            "I Really Like The Game. But I would change a couple of things. I would like to be able to decline picking some furniture. I don't like rugs and paintings. We picked beautiful flooring and walls and then have to cover them up. Also sometimes we pick a color scheme such as pink or lavender and then a furnishing is not the same colors. Maybe a choice of the color scheme at the beginning with the cleaning etc"

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",
            "This is trouble some to me I have a 1 in the app window all of the time I do not know what to do of the 1 in the app window need help clearing the 1 in the app window . Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to goüò≠! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over ¬£200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. ¬£43 per year or ¬£12 per PER MONTH or ¬£4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me ¬£5 per month and Netflix ¬£8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "Simply impressed !! You guys out did yourselves, fantasic storyline with a dark undertone. Beautiful and haunting music, coupled with detailed and beautiful artwork. Loved the backstory and graphics, including the CGI animation. Good work on how the evidence board was compiled to move the story along with the prisoner, nothing was boring. Nice puzzles and hidden object scenes. Had fun, keep'em coming.",
            "I love the game but I hate how I now have to pay for it like why I had completed most of the game before and now you have to pay to continue the game. I had the game on another device",
            "This game is amazing and extremely exciting/interesting, but it would be a lot better if the entire gameplay could be unlocked for free instead of just an intro.",
            "Downloaded this as I remember liking the original a long time ago. It didn't give me enough time to even refresh my memory, before the demo was over with a request for my money!! Am deleting it as we speak and will NOT be downloading any of their games in the future! One very dissatisfied customer."

            "This is a horrible game. I liked it but then i saw that needed things are only locked. If i read a massage and i want to reply it, then i can't. There is no option to reply. Hospital, photo booth and spa is locked. My suggestion will be to not download the game. Coco play games are good but if they will unlock every thing and make new games then it will be good. I have uninstalled it. If you already downloaded then delete it.",
            "Nice games but so many locked dresses ,makeup , hairstyles , hair colour ,etc . it's ok we can unlock by watching adds but what about the dance moves ,spa and hospital we have to buy only . That's why I had given only 3 stars . My request is there that unlock some dance moves and keep some to buy at least keep 3-4 moves . About spa and hospital you keep two options 1. To buy and get it . 2. Keep 20 or 15 ads to watch and then unlock . It's better if you keep like this way .",
            "This game is really fun and all but at my FIRST performance I kept hearing somebody whisper something like \"press that\" but it was creepy. I also hate that you have to unlock a load of stuff",
            "I hope you add more clothes, shoes, hairstyles, nail arts, accessories, stage designs and music if this isn't for free so we could at least enjoy more even not having full version. Make it worth the pay if possible to those who purchased it too. IF NOT, we can watch ads to unlock everything and get access to it (while you still earning back from it.) I love to play the full version but paying for full version when it's still lacking, its not worthwhile. Thank you.",

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ‚ù§",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! üòÄ",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwUü•∞ü§©",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend üòâ",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw!

            "DON'T PLAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! It would be a nice game but unless your willing to spend money your not going to get anywhere. Its ridiculously difficult to get any üíé's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough üíé's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",

            "Paid for a no ads version, but all the ads keep showing up. I bought it to keep my granddaughter entertained during a long flight and it was just annoying having to be dealing with ads every few minutes since she didn't know how to get rid of them.",
            "Like so many reviewers, we paid to remove ads and they are still there. They went away after we paid, but after we closed and restarted game again, the ads came back and aren't going away. DON'T pay to remove ads - it's a scam.",

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "Awesome game. I think the developers are flat earth believers. Try going into the river and drive to the right. The truck goes upto a 1000 kmph. Looks really fun but you end up losing $200 game currency as the fuel runs out. üòÇ",
            "Great game, well payed in the game currency, but you need the street lights on the opposing side of the street, and an american map, and it would be nice to have different sirens, and to have a red and white lights, with a fire dept. Symbol you can edit please.",
            "Really good game, but I think it could be better if it had a few different scenarios instead of the same options on the GPS buttons but they should have different countries where you can see and use"

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

Won't even tell me the issue.",

Alit of these apos or sites incthe past would run a bot system to time out random convetsation to make it seemclike they liked you. Only to find out they were shady sites fishing for pics so they could run them somewhete else. I cant stand trash developers or dishonesty when it comes to peoples money and feelings.

There is an obstacle that basically has an hour glass shape balancing on a tall, thin, rectangle. The designer did not balance the shapes correctly and it falls, covering the path entirely. There is no way to get the ball through pass these obstacles. The first one i was able to get through before they fell, but there was a second obstacle that had already fallen down. Extremely frustrating.",

Perfect game. Just reached level 2000 and still going...",
            "It is so horrible game . Always they give ADD in this game after 1 match . But from 1 to 30 level it is good . ADD = Advertise, And they tell to purchase ‚Çπ 250 on this game only for the ADDS . So I Give only 2 stars. I downloaded 2 times and unnistaled 1 time . But also they will give more ADDS.",
            "I would rate this 5 stars if there weren't any ads every two levels. That's the thing that I dislike about this game. It's really satisfying and enjoyable, and would be more enjoyable without ad interruptions every few levels. Overall, decent game.",
            "It's a good game although levels are repeated. Also what are coins used for? I've gotten all the patterns but the coins are there.... I suggest maybe you could update and add ball designs so that we can purchase them...if not just stop giving coins it disturbs the game flow ... Thank you"

            "Ok so this game is 100% on my recommendation list the levels aren't to hard and their quite fun actually! The reason I did 4 stars is the controls after a while the controls get very tedious as the controls don't move the right way to how you need them too, I think it's a bug of some sorts ,if you can fix that I'll up my review to 5 stars thank you for this game :3"

            "I'll start off with the pros then get to the cons. So first off, the games controls are easy and I love the style of it all. It's very good for killing time. Sadly, it can glitch sometimes and it is way to difficult. I have read other reviews and lots of people have this problem. Also, too many ads. There is an ad for every level and if you die, even if you don't choose to revive by watching an ad, you have to watch one. Also you never get any revives so you are forced to watch an ad to revive.",
            "This game is overall good but to many ads. I understand that u are getting paid for the ads and what not but there is to many.Therefore i play Rise Up offline when i am in the car or just bored outside of home. It is a rlly hard game but is brilliant for getting rid of bordem. Keep it up Rise Up but remove most ads pls. Yours Faithfully, chocolatesarefood",
            "I give you 5 stars because. I played a lot's of games means nearly 2 thousands game and this game is one of best game in my life. Yes, there are some missing things or some bugs. I think if we observe the game Defrently like it's music, it's theme, it will inspire us, this game will motivate us. And thing, if we play this game form our heart with Egnoring some bugs then this game will teach us how to survive in the world. It's my opinion. AND SORRY FOR MY POOR ENGLISH. üôÇüôÇ",
            "Enjoyable game to play, but there are some seriously savage bugs. Given that I write console games for a living, I know about bugs, but these surely couldn't have gone unnoticed? Shouldn't have been released in this state as it doesn't do a lot for your credibility. Also, the fact you run an advert every other play through, well, that just craps all over the general experience. Pity, this could have been a great game if it wasn't for the poor advert decisions and dubious execution.",
            "5 stars! Absolutely 5 stars! This game is so addictive i even have to take a break every day because of it, and im not mad at all! This game is very good to play when you are bored, and ads dont pop up as much as they do in other games. Totally amazing! I'd recommend this game to kids who are bored on the holidays or even the weekend!"

You need to pay money for all the zodiac signs and for most of the realistic painings of ladies... That is one my my complaints. Another one is that there are many adsüòï",
            "I love this app and ive been using for over a year now and its super good. Multiple different things you can color and its pretty cool. I would have given it 5 stars but the reason i gave 4 is because it has too many ads. If they could improve this then its a 5 starred app..",
            "This app is super good I loved it and it is the best app to do online painting I will prefer this Only one thing that I didn't like is it contains ads I am sure the team will do something",
            "This app is amazing i lovr that its so cute and theres a unicorn on the cover (i love unicorns eberybody pls download this app its so cute and awesome but i jabe one problem the adds stupid adds but i love everything frpm this game sp cute so niceüíóüíóüíó",

            "Scam, do not bother. Forces you to subscribe for almost 10 dollars - a month (!!!) before you even get to play, and then it is *still* choke-full of ads on every corner. The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",
            "I can't play.When I start the app, it shows me a way to continue and be a member(common)I click on the \"x\" and then another page appears wich allows me to pay for the membership I look and wait for an \"x\" I see none I can't do anything except pay wich I will NEVER do.I am really disappointed in this app I thought it would be fun but turns out it's just another stupid scam.DO NOT INSTALL.",
            "This is a horrendous app!! Won't allow you to even play, without paying 70 for a 1 year subscription. There is no way to exit, no X or option to use limited features. Total scam. Don't waste your time. Developers, you need to fix this issue!! Or delete the app!! Calling you out...",
            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

            "The best launcher ever, thanks a lot. I have ZenFone that I can assure you no one will buy this mobile phone! bC its launcher is the worst of all and the brand known as \"crash\". I have tried lots of launchers instead, yet I didn't experience the 'smooth' one. Your great app really follows your slogan \"smooth\", and you also fix the bugs that others was annoyed based on their comment.",
            "The newest update made it where the app is literally unusable. It crashes each time I try to make it my default homepage. I tried restarting my phone and it still won't open. Please fix this!!",
            "CRASH CRASH AND CRASH AGAIN! ü§¨ I've had this app for a long while now. Used to work great. Now every damn minute or so I get the annoying app keeps closing alert. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it and even wondered my other apps maybe interfering & causing it to crash. But then I thought \"I wonder if anyone else is having the same problem\" so I come on the play store, look at the reviews and big surprise its happening to everyone. THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR LAST \"UPDATE\"! VOILA.",
            "A very good app. Everything is simple and clear. Makes it without any confusion. I have used other launcher hola launcher very similar to solo launcher for many years it was my favourite but now not existing ; better in that range one and only is the Solo launcher. But now it is crashing in REDMI NOTE 9 pro max. And Samsung also. Need to sort it out immediately. Originally I rated five Star. But continuous crashes it is down rated.",
            "It just won't stop crashing I had a layout that i loved and now its all gone because I can't use the app after the \"update\""

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. üåü But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 üåü as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess üôÑ",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "This game is so cool and fun but the problem is that we cannot unlock hairstyles, frocks and so many things. It just made annoyed and disappointed üòî. And when we try to unlock it, it asks for money. Please fix this and make it all free with no money. If fix this problem I WILL GIVE 5 STARS. But overall this game is good and I love it üòä.",
            "I absolutely HATE this game, it's just terrible, I haven't even had it for 1 hour before I deleted it. The game has an add every 10 seconds, literally. It is also very laggy, and when I tried to create the skirt it makes you pull the entire fabric over and in the end it looks like trash, so I would rate this a 0 star if I could, You are Welcome.",
            "Hello...Myself Nidhi... This is a very nice game....Only the problem is toooooo much of adds and if google add will come then we can't go again to the game...we should clear that game and then go again...Plz update and fix this problem...I dont need adds.... Is it online....Plz tell me.... If this add problem goes then it can be 4 or 5 stars.... Nice game thenüëå",
            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall üëçüëç",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

Folders are becoming useless in that regard, it's easier just to create another home screen and do your best to organize.",
            "The only flaws I see with Nova and Nova Prime are as follows: I found it hard to set up the backup and restore directories. I always feel I can't to double-check the destination. I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5‚≠ê",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including ‚Ä¢ More materials ‚Ä¢ More space ‚Ä¢ And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "Highly unprofessional behaviour. I had booked from 4-5. The expert alotted calls up and say she is available after 5:30 or 6. She also said to cancel the booking and gave assurance that new expert would be alotted for the required slot. When I do that, the slots are shown booked. Why do they accept the requests if they are not available only. It was such a headache for me because I had to go somewhere in the evening and all other salons were fully booked for that day. Frst nd last experience.üëé",
            "Used app for first time, horrible experience. Person didn't had understanding of work assigned. broke my new lock and make shift arrangements were done which broke within one month. on contacting housejoy, no help was provided.",
            "It is not giving an option of typing my address manually. The App detects my location correctly but the address that it generates based on my GPS is not correct.. It shows 3 houses far away house-no. I tried to edit the house-no with the floor-no but not able to do it as it is allowing to set my address only via GPS. Allow users to manually type their address as well because at times the manual entry is more accurate than GPS generated house address.",
            "Waste app.. While booking any serive they will show small amount and the techinican who visits your home will ask 4-5 times higher amount which is shown while booking... If you complain about that also there will not be any response from Housejoy.. For just saying there is a problem in AC stabiliser technician charged 900/- and after he lefts I got a message that the charges for the service is 143/- means he as taken 5 times high amount regarding which I have complained for more than 6 times."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to üëç. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "This is the best app of its kind. I go into the settings to manually set the skip silence and I have the best experience for multiple projects. I use this for music, capturing dreams when I wake up, recording important conversations, and sorting out ideas. I've downloaded this on multiple phones, I just wish there was an apple version of it.",
            "It's Great! Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. üòé This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get itüòä",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",

            "Great app! I use this to mess with my friends and family. But, the reason my rating is 4 stars is that there are way too many ads!! I hate that if I want to change a drink, I HAVE TO WATCH AN AD! This has gone out of control. Back then, this game had a fair amount of ads, but now? It's out of control. Another feature I would love is minigames. Also, please make it so that the fruit float so it is more realistic. Overall, 4 stars. Great way to enterain! But please remove some of the ads. Bye! üòÄ",
            "This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over againüôÑ I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!üëã",
            "Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",
            "It's actually pretty good i give it a 5 star rating as we the drinks look 100 percent real as it looks in the app or photos given over here and I don't have to watch an ad i mean if someone is saying this than its totally wrong because i didn't need to watch and ad really cool game üòô",
            "Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. \"Select tones already on device\" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: ("

            "Either this Game is rigged or i dont know solitare ..multiple times it hides a key card at the bottom of an unmovable deck.. Example all under one collum with no shuffles no hints no moves. Just undo.. And that's not fun.",
            "This game is usually great but tonight I can't even do the daily challenge because the cards aren't right. Its giving me two diamond aces and I can't clear the heart cards to complete the challenge. Also I can't move cards around to sit in the right places so that I can get to the cards underneath them. Please fix this bug.",
            "The ads are very annoying and this app is full of them. I get they have to fund the app but some of them are way too long. Biggest issue for me is the glitches. The number of times you turn a card over and its blank. My new personal favourite though is duplicate cards appearing in a game! How can you complete it when you have 2 of the same cards in a pack...seriously. Used to love this game but its becoming ridiculous.",
            "One of the worst games on here. I tried to play 1 hand and was bombarded with 6 ads. All stopped play so i just removed this waste of space.",
            "This game is to pushy with it's features. If I wanted to play the daily challenge, I would play the daily challenge. I don't need in game pop-ups to \"encourage\" me to play the daily challenge while I'm playing a game. All the other pop-ups just get in the way as well. And if you have to sit through ads that won't let you play the game until the ad is finished, then why do you need a banner at the top where you are playing so you accidentally click on the ads?"

It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",
            "I find this game okay, I guess. It's just the ads that really ruin the experience for me. You get an ad every level, and each level takes less time than the ad you receive after."

            "I love a quick game when I have a minute but lots of the newer ads force you to wait for 30 seconds or longer and when you try to close using the X it opens up the google play website. Not just once, but over and over again. Especially bad with 'playable' ads. I sometimes don't even bother waiting to play the game and choose another app. I can't click on your link from here, but I'm using Android 6.0.1 on an Asus tablet, if that helps.",
            "Love love love this particular Spider Solitaire! I got to the point where I had to delete the app because I was playing it too much! The ads are fun, relative and short. Not very invasive. Gives you the option to delete ads and start the game or keep watching and play when done. Fun little goals to achieve within the app, as well. This is THE BEST. I'm sad I have to stay all over cuz I was like almost a year's worth of medals and trophies etc.. Haha. Thanks",
            "Great but you've started to have ads that play sound even though my phone is on silent with media sounds off. This really should not be allowed. I can't play a game that does this as it annoys people around me. I should not have to use earbuds to avoid that. It's my phone and I choose, silence. If this continues then I delete this game.",
            "When I first downloaded this game , over a year ago, I really liked it. I enjoyed playing the daily challenge and earning a jeweled crown. My crowns started disappearing overnight. I've contacted support several times , but they couldn't tell me why this happens. They gave me some crowns back, but that's beside the point. It continues to happen. I've even uninstalled the app completely, turned off my phone, and reinstalled. That doesn't help. I think I'm done.",
            "playing 3 Mobility Ware games until recently. Had to delete free cell first. now it's spider that's glitches. Stops working, juddering, shuts down my phone. Shame. Will switch to other card apps. UPDATE Oct 2020. Reinstalled working ok. Now plagued by Asian ads you can't read so dare not click on as no idea where it will take you. Then game freezes."

When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry üò≠üò°üò°üëøüë∫üòæ",

What I didn't like: -The game forgot what items I already unlocked -Doesn't keep my previous selections as the defaults. -Some types of items aren't removable. Example: it forces me to wear a ring or a bracelet if I had already put one on because I can't remove it unless I replace it with another one. -Crashes too often. -Intrusive ads. -Voting system poorly explained. -Washing hair was tedious and not fun. -The gym game doesn't fit the workout theme and isn't fun.",

Developer: Can you program a few buttons to Recall the wavelenghts saved? Thank you so much!",
