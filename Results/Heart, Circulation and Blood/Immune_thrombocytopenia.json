        "description": "The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.\r\n\r\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.\r\n\r\nSupport Language:\r\n\r\n✔ English\r\n✔ العربية\r\n✔ Magyar\r\n✔ Tiếng Việt\r\n✔ Nederlands\r\n✔ Espanٌol\r\n✔ italiano\r\n✔ català\r\n✔  japanese\r\n✔ korean\r\n✔ lietuvių\r\n✔ Deutsch\r\n✔ فارْسِى\r\n✔ polski\r\n✔ Português\r\n✔ română\r\n✔ slovensk‎\r\n✔ slovenski\r\n✔ ภาษาไทย\r\n✔ Türkçe\r\n✔ українська\r\n✔ suomi\r\n✔ français\r\n✔ हिन्दी\"\r\n✔ hrvatski\r\n✔ Cestina\r\n✔ Svenska\r\n✔ 日本語\r\n✔ Euskara\r\n✔ Indonesia",

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.\r\n\r\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism&#39;s own healthy tissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions. In humans, the blood–brain barrier, blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system, which protects the brain.<br><br>Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.

        "title": "Boost Your Immune System",
        "description": "If you want to boost your immune health, you may wonder how to help your body fight off illnesses.\r\n\r\nWhile bolstering your immunity is easier said than done, several dietary and lifestyle changes may strengthen your body’s natural defenses and help you fight harmful pathogens, or disease-causing organisms.\r\nHere are some tips to strengthen your immunity naturally.\r\n1. Get enough sleep\r\nSleep and immunity are closely tied.\r\n\r\nIn fact, inadequate or poor quality sleep is linked to a higher susceptibility to sickness.\r\n\r\nIn a study in 164 healthy adults, those who slept fewer than 6 hours each night were more likely to catch a cold than those who slept 6 hours or more each night (1).\r\n\r\nGetting adequate rest may strengthen your natural immunity. Also, you may sleep more when sick to allow your immune system to better fight the illness (2).\r\n\r\nAdults should aim to get 7 or more hours of sleep each night, while teens need 8–10 hours and younger children and infants up to 14 hours (3).\r\n\r\nIf you’re having trouble sleeping, try limiting screen time for an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted from your phone, TV, and computer may disrupt your circadian rhythm, or your body’s natural wake-sleep cycle (4).\r\n\r\nOther sleep hygiene tips include sleeping in a completely dark room or using a sleep mask, going to bed at the same time every night, and exercising regularly (3).\r\n\r\n2. Eat more whole plant foods\r\nWhole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes are rich in nutrients and antioxidants that may give you an upper hand against harmful pathogens.\r\n\r\nThe antioxidants in these foods help decrease inflammation by combatting unstable compounds called free radicals, which can cause inflammation when they build up in your body in high levels (5).\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation is linked to numerous health conditions, including heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and certain cancers.\r\nEat more healthy fats\r\nHealthy fats, like those found in olive oil and salmon, may boost your body’s immune response to pathogens by decreasing inflammation.\r\n\r\nAlthough low-level inflammation is a normal response to stress or injury, chronic inflammation can suppress your immune system (8).\r\n\r\nOlive oil, which is highly anti-inflammatory, is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

        "descriptionHTML": "If you want to boost your immune health, you may wonder how to help your body fight off illnesses.<br><br>While bolstering your immunity is easier said than done, several dietary and lifestyle changes may strengthen your body’s natural defenses and help you fight harmful pathogens, or disease-causing organisms.<br>Here are some tips to strengthen your immunity naturally.<br>1. Get enough sleep<br>Sleep and immunity are closely tied.<br><br>In fact, inadequate or poor quality sleep is linked to a higher susceptibility to sickness.<br><br>In a study in 164 healthy adults, those who slept fewer than 6 hours each night were more likely to catch a cold than those who slept 6 hours or more each night (1).<br><br>Getting adequate rest may strengthen your natural immunity. Also, you may sleep more when sick to allow your immune system to better fight the illness (2).<br><br>Adults should aim to get 7 or more hours of sleep each night, while teens need 8–10 hours and younger children and infants up to 14 hours (3).<br><br>If you’re having trouble sleeping, try limiting screen time for an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted from your phone, TV, and computer may disrupt your circadian rhythm, or your body’s natural wake-sleep cycle (4).<br><br>Other sleep hygiene tips include sleeping in a completely dark room or using a sleep mask, going to bed at the same time every night, and exercising regularly (3).<br><br>2. Eat more whole plant foods<br>Whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes are rich in nutrients and antioxidants that may give you an upper hand against harmful pathogens.<br><br>The antioxidants in these foods help decrease inflammation by combatting unstable compounds called free radicals, which can cause inflammation when they build up in your body in high levels (5).<br><br>Chronic inflammation is linked to numerous health conditions, including heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and certain cancers.<br>Eat more healthy fats<br>Healthy fats, like those found in olive oil and salmon, may boost your body’s immune response to pathogens by decreasing inflammation.<br><br>Although low-level inflammation is a normal response to stress or injury, chronic inflammation can suppress your immune system (8).<br><br>Olive oil, which is highly anti-inflammatory, is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Plus, its anti-inflammatory properties may help your body fight off harmful disease-causing bacteria and viruses (9, 10).<br><br>Omega-3 fatty acids, such as those in salmon and chia seeds, fight inflammation as well (11).<br>5. Limit added sugars<br>Emerging research suggests that added sugars and refined carbs may contribute disproportionately to overweight and obesity (16, 17).<br><br>Obesity may likewise increase your risk of getting sick.<br><br>According to an observational study in around 1,000 people, people with obesity who were administered the flu vaccine were twice as likely to still get the flu than individuals without obesity who received the vaccine (18).<br><br>Curbing your sugar intake can decrease inflammation and aid weight loss, thus reducing your risk of chronic health conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease (19, 20).<br><br>Given that obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease can all weaken your immune system, limiting added sugars is an important part of an immune-boosting diet (18, 21, 22).<br><br>You should strive to limit your sugar intake to less than 5% of your daily calories.

I can now set my diet and get some amazing recipes for the foodie inside me so I don't have to keep craving for anything good. Amazing app, worth having.",
            "Really an intelligent and thoughtful app. Tells about balance diet, calories intakes, diet chart, cooking recipes and all. Especially for vegan this is a treat, gives lot of options for healthy breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner. Still exploring I guess a lot more what I discovered so far. A very balanced and clean app , I m loving it !!",
            "I just downloaded this app this morning! And here i am at 12.12 pm still looking at the plethora of the recipes. I can't wait for shopping day after the 27th of this month. Yes, i ask on disablity, and have to pinch pennies ! This website will increase My nutritional intake. As the recipes on this app are fairly frugal. I am very happy to have found this app.",
            "The best fitness apps that I've ever used. It lets you develop a health profile where you can save your diet information. Once you input diet info, Immune bowl will offer meal suggestions. It can't get any easier! You can keep a track of your per day calorie count. Simply loved it!!",
            "The app is very informative in terms of the food options, recipe, calorific intake etc. The think that I love most about the app is that it has these notes that tell you, how to can reuse some ingredients or if you like sweeter things, how you could do that wish your dish in a healthier way. Great Job guys!"

Stress relief techniques, homeopathic treatments, antioxidant diets, super foods, the list goes on and on. You or a loved one is suffering from a low platelet count and you just don't have the time to sort out fact from fiction. What is the truth about natural remedies for platelet disorder?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that these and other natural remedies don't work for everybody. If you keep reading you will not only find why but also if they can be expected to work at all. This information is important because low platelet count is serious, a possible sign of ITP disease (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura). Standard medical treatments can be strong drugs such as Prednisone or Danazole or even removal of the spleen.\r\n\r\nNatural remedies are sought after because unlike prescription drugs or surgery there are little or no unwanted side effects. The problem is if you follow a certain remedy without knowing if is beneficial for your specific circumstances you could be wasting valuable time. There are multiple causes for low platelet count or ITP disease and you need to identify your specific ones.\r\n\r\nFor example: One of the natural remedies promoted to fight platelet dysfunction is vitamin D. Many suffering from low platelet count take high doses of D. And D has been proven to help ITP disease. But if you are not deficient in D than the remedy will not work for you. In fact high doses of vitamin D is toxic and can be harmful.\r\n\r\nThe point is, before using a natural remedy make sure it is the right one for you. There are ways of determining this. To start with consult a nutritionally oriented medical or naturopathic doctor. He will help you identify the root cause of your low platelet count.\r\n\r\nNatural remedies are beneficial and many have increased platelets using them. By doing so harmful drugs, surgery and unwanted side effects have been avoided. You could do the same if you educate yourself and take personal responsibility for your health. Good health to you.",

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

In the word Mudra 'mud' means joy and 'ra' means produce. It produces joy and cheerfulness. Mudras originated from Hinduism and Buddhism. 200 Mudras are used in Bharatanatyam and 250 Mudras are in Mohiniattam, 108 Mudras used in Tantric rituals. In other terms Mudras are silent language of self expression and consisting of hand gestures and finger postures. \r\n\r\nMudras involve the entire body and looks as a closed electrical circuit which can pass energy throughout the body. The physical body is made up of five elements. The Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring and Little finger represents Fire, Air, Sky, Earth and Water respectively. Imbalance of these five elements interrupts the immunity system and causes diseases. When a finger representing an element is brought into contact with the thumb element the disturbance is brought into balance, therefore the disease caused by the imbalance is cured. \r\n\r\nUsually from 5 to 45 minutes is required to practice everyday by using appropriate Mudra with proper pressure and touch including sitting position and breathing.\r\n\r\nHowever the effectiveness of the Mudras not only depends on the practices but it also depends on the eating habit, diet and the lifestyle of a person.\r\n\r\nSpeciality of Mudras:\r\n•  Mudras are used extensively in Yoga, Meditation and Dance.\r\n•  It does not need any money or special ability to be performed but it just needs some patience.\r\n•  There is no age limit to perform Mudras, people of age group 5 to 90 can perform it.\r\n•  If you want to stay healthy by physically, mentally and spiritually it is recommended to practice the Mudras daily.\r\n•  Mudras helps to release stress.

            "This app has helped me a lot for converting me into myself. But I wanna suggest one thing that if it can provide meditation music which keeps sounding utill the appointed time's up, it will give more effective results.As it breaks at every 10 to 15 seconds that's little bit annoying to concentrate. Thank You.🙂",
            "I gained much knowledge from this app, but I want to shed light towards the problem that the articles which come in notifications and are accessible through the app, cannot be read after they have been closed. What I mean is, it would have been good if there was a section to read the articles only... Other wise it is a good app.",
            "Love the intention behind this app😍.. it not only teaches you abt different mudras but also provides you various options like mudras acc to body parts or benifits, precautions ets... the whole layout is sooo engaging, there is a timer attached, no need to open another app to record time while doing mudras... Last but not the least, love the random articles it have, small but inspiring!!!👌",
            "Brilliant app... Using it from more than 2 yrs...and have recommended it to family and friends. Just want a personalized profile instead of going all the time in the list and checking the mudra for specific disorder. if u can ask initially and give related mudras on 1st page...and remaining in other pages would be helpful.",
            "Very very useful app. It is beautifully designed for individual body parts and this is user friendly also. I have tried 2 mudras as of now and feel my mind is relaxed. As some of the users have mentioned, kindly add a video tutorial for each of the mudras so that we can follow and practice in a correct way. Great team 👍 thank you for this wonderful app"

            "This app can clean junk files and find duplicate files, so they can be deleted (cleaned). It also can find any large files that are taking up allot of space, then you can select the large files that you don't want to keep, so they can be removed. I've only used this app a few times, so if there are any other features that I overlooked, then I probably haven't encountered them yet.",
            "Earlier I requested to reduce the text size and you did it. Thanks a lot, now it is looking very good. I have one more suggestion/request. It shows, for example in my phone, out of \"64 GB\", 20 GB used. But in 64 GB some space are reserved, as we know, so it is quite difficult for me to analyze what actual space I used out of the free space. It should show something like out of 43 GB free space that has been given to user, I have used 20 GB. I hope you understand what I am trying to say.",
            "I love that this app finds your duplicate files, however there is not enough information provided. What does the little white tag in the corner of the photo mean? After you click delete a message asks-do you want to delete all versions of downloaded files? (4) What? Why? I selected more than 4 photos. Which ones are these? Did I select all versions? Then, NO. But your only choice is yes (recommended) or cancel which goes back to the previous screen, thereby blocking the delete function. SCARY!",
            "Like many of the Google apps, this one is both helpful and annoying. It is helpful to have an app that makes it easier to clean up my phone and get rid of unneeded files to free up space. On the other hand, it's annoying that it always wants to delete my downloaded pictures, music, etc., that I really want to keep on my phone.",
            "I have always loved Google files. A lot of times you think you have cleared out a lot of junk. But then you think to see what files may say. And you are surprised to see that you missed some. Great gift you get even more free space. THANK YOU again Google! Edited, I just got a new phone and files was one of the first appt I downloaded. It is still a must have.🤗 Edit. 10/26/20 I just wanted to repeat everything I said already. Especially for my Lenovo Chromebook Duet Google Files is the best."

Honestly its annoying, shouldn't once be enough already? now i can't even get into my account cause they're asking for my phone number, and it says that its unsupported, which doesn't make sense cause thats what i've been using 4 making accs..",

It doesn't go back to the tweet I was looking at. Can you please fix it everything was working fine before :)",

Thought it was because of the connection or it just needs an update but no, it took forever before it worked properly.

Everything has slowed down to a crawl, it's laggy, notifications don't work and there is no transparency in what exactly is changed or improved with each download just \"bugfixes\" they write, who knows what stuff they are secretly adding or doing that effects your private things. Heavily Disappointed. Fix this please and reply to the users instead of ignoring them.",

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

Waste of money - 6 months on the program, payment upfront - cumulative weight loss 3kg - could have lost a lot more on my own without spending the inordinate amount of cash. Don't waste your time or effort - not worth it.",
            "Hey team, This app is broke, i put in my details as 20yrs old, 5'8 , 53 kg and target weight as 60kg. It said i fall in Ideal weight category and instead of showing weight gain plans it was recommending me weight loss plans! To cross verify i put in my current weight as 40kg and to my surprise it was still saying i fall in ideal weight category. Either your app doesn't has any weight gain plans or it is simply broke. Kindly look forward to this.",
            "Although I started my journey with Truweight hardly a month ago yet I could achieve a remarkable reduction and stability in my blood sugar levels from the region of 180-250 to a level between 105-130. This coupled with a weight loss of 1kg is very important for me. And what is most important is that it has been achieved not by eating less but by eating right. I am thankful to my coach for guiding me through.",
            "Wow 👏 😮 It's like if all of your videos are superheroes. My weight is slowly but surely getting less. Thank you for this app. I wonder how these industries are fooling us well I am on day 2. I 💘😻love the app. Although where is the motivation tab?",
            "Awesome Dieticians and very good product line. A perfect solution to your health journey. Really feel great to make them partner in a new journey of becoming healthy and toned.

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",

I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",
            "Really an amazing game. I've never found a game that's better than minecraft! I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",
            "I love this app. I have played it for many years but recently it hasn't been working. Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

            "Its a good app, but lately i have been getting spam notification from russian email account. These notifications come to mobile with a document containing a link. sometimes i accidentally click on them. I had to install an antivirus and also resort to better security for all devices in the network because of this. I also see this issue been reported to you guys, please advice on how to be safe on this matter.",
            "Can't upload any file. Tried using mobile data as well as wifi. It shows preparing to upload and an animated icon. Nothing got uploaded. I am facing no issues when using laptop to upload the same file... I tried resetting app data and cache, still no change. I recommend checking your app first and then respond. Same issues were happening with my brother's phone and the files were uploaded after an hour. Unlike him I am not having the time nor patience. I have high speed broadbanconnection.",
            "Total mess. 1. When uploading things to the drive, I used to get a black arrow pointing upwards in my notifications to indicate that the upload was complete. Now, I have to manually go in and check to see if the upload has been completed. 2. Many uploads, for reasons which can only be down to the app, are not uploading completely and failing. The thing is you never know until after think you have saved space in your phone and deleted the item.",
            "Upload from phone won't work. So hit and miss most of the time and often can't upload. Very frustrating. Edit: responding to Google LLC, I am using the app. On my phone. And I have tried incognito and the browser. Also how is a different network a solution? What am I supposed to do? Change my mobile service provider in order to use this app? I've paid for extra storage and honestly think this is a terrible app. I'd give it no stars at this point I'm so frustrated with it . :(",
            "This app is so disappointing..... immediately I installed it, I tried uploading a file on there...it just didn't work, I tried multiple times but still nothing. It was like a complete waste of my time and WiFi. I still haven't been able to make use of it. So I'll definitely uninstall it soon because it's simply..only clugging my phone memory."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "There's actually a lot of educational and helpful people on this app from all different backgrounds and it's actually incredible to be able to learn from them. It can also just be fun and silly. It all depends on what you're looking for. I only have one real complaint and it's that I wish you had more characters to write a comment with. I'm an extremely long winded person and the limit makes it feel difficult to communicate efficiently for me. I haven't had the app for very long though. 🤷🏾‍♀",
            "This app is amazing !!! It keeps you very entertained and you can spend hours on it without being bored , but there are lots of problems , minor problems and big problems. A big problem for example would be Tik Tok deleting random videos which really annoys me , some of my favourite videos have been deleted for no reason , and another huge issue is the community , the people in the comments always say mean stuff to the creators of that video and it really bugs me because I feel so bad for them.",
            "I really enjoy the app, very much, but there are a couple/few of things I would love to see updated: *1. Make it possible to edit a video after posting (too many times I have made a last minute change, which (for whatever reason) changed the placement of an embedded text. SO IRRITATING); *2. While in the editing process, make it so the timing duration doesn't disappear; *3. Disclose how one can become \"verified\" (this actually may be in the app somewhere, but I haven't been able to locate it);",
            "I love tiktok. But sometimes the app freezes and its sorta annoying. And why should we have to link our phone number? I can't text like that. And we should be able to have multiple accounts with the same phone number. I know that could be dangerous but you could notify the other account(s) with the same number to see if it is the same person. And until this is fixed I will rate one less star every month.",
            "I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."

But when I accidentally deleted it and just downloaded it today, it made me let Picsart have the permission to access my Storage. I went to settings to change the permissions but it wouldn't let me, and now I can't do anything. For now I'm giving this 4 stars overall. FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!!!",
            "Okay so, I like this app. I love how you can edit your photos and videos. It's just why cant you edit your videos without the text costing too much. Like I want to edit my videos and add text and it cost too much with the premium. But overall theres not a lot of problems, it does lag so it always mess up my edits and I have to start over. BUT I recommend this app for anyone!👍🏾",
            "been using the premium version for over a year. good but has issues. sometimes slow, sometimes doesn't see images (even those you just edited with this app), even after multiple refresh/reopening the app, the gallery, cleaning the cache and even restarting the phone. no other pics editing app has this issue on my phone. will switch to another app once i find the better option. p.s. they should definitely work on their text editing options. poor so far.",
            "well, it's always going back while im editing, but maybe it's just my phone. it's just MY experience with it. no need to get worked up by it. Edit: well, I've changed to my 4 stars to 2 stars because it won't let me edit. It won't let me do anything. I thought it was my lack of storage space, but I've fred up a lot and it still won't work.",
            "The app is quite good but the only thing I hate is that when I actually want to apply effects to a picture, it keeps loading and then they turn me back to the editing page. I reinstalled the app but it still does the same thing. Please fix this issue real quick or I might uninstall the app"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Good job in fitting Excel, Word, Lens and Powerpointt in one app. The number of bugs have been greatly reduced over the past months. I'm hoping to see further integration of OneNote in the future. The user experience has been mostly smooth. Files seamlessly sync with OneDrive. Office Transfer is also a great tool built in to the app, which allows for fast media & file transfers between the phone and PC. Would recommend this app 100%.",
            "This app is quite better than WPS Office. However, Office Suite has better visuals and accessibility. Plus, it does not show whether the file was saved or not. And it doesn't have the discard option when you don't want to save a document. Tapping on texts zooms in and out and doesn't point to where I want to type. The app also occupies too much storage in my device. (500 Mb).",
            "Very helpful app. Word, excel, PowerPoint all under one umbrella. But has some bugs to fix. When I use app for some 5 minutes the app exit itself and I want to start from the beginning. This usually happens when I use word, or lens for some time. So please fix this. Or please add a auto save feature. And I can't find a scroll button in the .ppt files. So please add this. So I can scroll down slides very fast when I am not in slideshow.",
            "This Office application will not work properly after only a few days of use. I am unable to open this Office app on my Samsung Chromebook. The app opens for only a few seconds, then closes without notice. I have tried uninstalling the app, then reinstalling the app, but this action did not correct the issue. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing due to my reliance on this app to complete undergraduate coursework in Office type documents. I am unable to retrieve my documents.",
            "Impossible To Keep Same \"Theme Font\". I'm typing up songs I write. It keeps changing the Font of every single word; I must go back & put in smaller font so my words fit page. I changed over from \"Docs\" as the margins are better with Office, but I may go back. Office keeps putting a period after each Guitar chord (Letter) I write above words; Docs does same thing. Annoying. Not user friendly."

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please? Thank you.",
            "I liked this game very much...✌🏻It's amazing😍👍🏻It's features are also too good 👍🏻✌🏻But one ☝thing I doesn't like is that, that when I am playing my 🎮game the, \"Unity Ads\" Crash/stop 🙅my 🎮game... The other ads like goggle ads are good then unity ads... because they doesn't stop/crash my 🎮game... I hope that you will remove unity ads.. Plz reply about this.... Thank You for reading my post..."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "Zedge is an awesome application for the customization of your ringtones and notification sounds. It has an incredible selection of wallpapers but I wouldn't say that's the star quality of this app but when it comes down to customizing ringtones and notification sounds... I haven't searched for a notification, alarm, or ringtone that Zedge didn't have, or a supplemental sound that sounds just as good if not better!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! I don't think I will ever use another software/program!!",
            "I love it . But they don't have \"WHAT'S UP\" . They used to. I had it as my friends ring tone and somehow I lost it. I have been trying and trying to find it again, to no avail . All I could find is these stupid whistle songs. I really want the loud \"WHAT'S UP \" I believe it came from a Budweiser commercial. My friend says it all the time. I am hard of hearing so I need a really loud ring tone. Otherwise it's a great app.",
            "Went downhill. Can't find download files for live wallpaper and mandatory 30 sec ads to download each wallpaper, and then not being able to find it. And they even include a little useless chat bubble that says it's stored in internal storage > data but it's not there (and the article they link you to is useless too!) 🙃🙃 Honestly I have this app cause I've used it for over 5+ years but yikes it sucks now.",
            "Mediocre! It used to work perfectly, no problems. But recently when I allocate a ringtone to either my phone or a contact it works for a short time, then reverts back to the default phone ringtone. When I try to reallocate the ringtone in the app, it states, 'Something went wrong'. I initially paid the £3.99 thinking this may fix the issue, but no luck. Cancelled the prescription immediately. Only get this app if you like getting ignored by the app developers, as I've still not had any response.",
            "I like the Zedge app's massive amount of ringtones, notifications, and wallpapers to choose from, but I don't think this app has enough different categories of smartphone customizing features available. I think this app, it's developers, and it's users would all benefit greatly from a few theme customization options to download, for example, there could be an in-app option that allows the user to create their own custom app themes, custom text fonts, and a customized wallpaper creator."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

            "Purchase packs are mostly affordable, but boatloads are needed for any real impact. There is a good social aspect to the game. The game is enjoyable and addictive for the conflict style of game. It's by far the best that I've played of it's style......It's a pity IGG is more interested in making money than the players. Expect to get a \"dah\" response to any real review of the game where they try to promote themselves in spite of your review.",
            "I've been playing the game for a few years, yes is can be grinding at time. And yes, the giant players are pay to play. Buut, it's been a great expereince. I've made a lot of friends, had a ton of fun and keep coming back for me. Also, full disclosure I've probably spent 50 bucks on in game purchases over the last 3 years so I didn't have drop a ton on money to have fun. Mainly spent it on Monster Hunting so in my opinion worth it to have more fun in game.",
            "The game is fun, no doubt about that. The in app purchases seem lackluster at best, as they seldom offer you what you need. Also, if you are willing to roll the dice with the \"chest of chance\" that they offer you, be prepared to spend some money because buying less than 100 of them will leave you as disappointed as a kid on Christmas with no gifts. However, as I mentioned before, the game is fun to play. Customer service ultimately killed this game for me though. Uninstalling now.",
            "What I like about this game are the cool heros. It can be addictive. This is the only game in which I have ever had my hands trembling in anger and anxiety. When my castle gets attacked; screen flashes red making me panic. Then the stupid popups when you open the game gets in the way of you quickly activating your sheild, b/c every second counts in this game. This game also attracts the worst kind of people and also a few nice(guild) people. This game is too demanding so I'll be uninstalling."

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

Big downsides: Diamonds which you need to send digital \"gifts\" to the broadcaster are expensive, e.g. 450 for $10 but gifts vary from 1 diamond to 9999. Another big downside is there are several scammers with fake profiles now. When they latch on, you'll just want to leave. Basically, \"a license to print graphics\".",

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

            "Where are the functions of editing pictures such as merger of photos, opacity, embossing etc etc. My devise has Canva since a long time but I didn't try. Today I decided to see what Canva offering different to other creative Apps and Im disappointed to see there's not much we can do to create something amazing. Even the basic editing functions like frames, borders, choice of fonts, alignments etc are missing. Or perhaps, I may be unable to find those functions, any help would be much appreciated",
            "I was totally enjoying the app so much! I was using it pretty much everyday between computer and phone until the last update. That just messed everything up. I really hope you guys bring back the editing functionality between computer and phone. I'm still paying my subscription to not fully use it anymore.",
            "Meh, or if you like subscription services ... There are free items, but at least on my screen the \"free\" is so tiny, so it is hard to easily find free items- and this was just trying it out. I also had to create an account to do so... I used a non free background , and to save it would cost 1.99 or signing up for a \"free\" 14 day trial, which by the way if you forget to cancel,the monthly and yearly fees are hefty-$14.99 and $119.99 I think it said. Maybe if you have an expense account?",
            "Samsung Tablet Unfriendly (Tab S7). When installed this app via Play Store, it won't go to Landscape mode. When installing this app via Galaxy Store, the design layouts are always wrong. BUT when viewing the same design on browser or Canva app downloaded from Play Store, it looks properly aligned. When design is downloaded, it looks proper, too.",
            "A really great platform to create simple visuals. Plenty of options and easy to work with. I use the paid version and the only thing that's a huge minus is that from mobile I can't access the photo folders that I have created on my computer, meaning from mobile I can use only photos on my phone. Another annoying bug is if I search for photos in my phone folders and select one to be used in a pre-made template, it sometimes doesn't save the photo in the template and I gave to look for it again."

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "The app opens and allows me to fill in my pre-made forms. The problem is I can't 'save as' to a different file name within the app which is stopping me from easily reusing the form. I can't even rename a file within the app! If it doesn't get resolved soon I'll have to stop my subscription. Edit: Also urgently needed is the option to 'flatten' documents so as filled in forms can't be changed by someone else later. Even free apps allow this. Now cancelled my subscription until Adobe sort this.",
            "This is useful for editing PDF files i have to edit. But there is some problems that makes it annoying to use: 1.using Fill and Sign Text sometimes undoes itself for no reason. So you must save alot of times which is annoying. 2 sometimes saving also undoes some text 3 there is no copy and paste (well you can paste but you cannot select a text to copy it.)",
            "Great extension of the powerful desktop application. The PDF ecosystem is mature and well functioning. There is just no way around Adobe if you want to get the best out of it, especially on the creation side. But seriously, make your applications faster again. They are becoming bloated and slow.",

            "Please improve the payment process. 100 out of 100 times after my credit card payment it shows blank screen, when I click back it tells me payment failed but it actually done. The order is still in my cart, this is very misleading. After my 1st and 2nd orders I learnt about this, so it's fine for me, but to new users this is very annoying. Anyway, this app provide good service and I appreciate it.",
            "I have ordered many times via this app. It will work...IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK. Like today, I tried 7 or 8 times trying to PAY but I just couldn't pay. I am paying by credit card. I got to the screen and got the OTP and then I entered the OTP and then.... NOTHING. Waited for so long until the system tells me \"TIME OUT\". Seven or eight times trying. Giving up for today. Maybe try again tomorrow or maybe not at all. One more thing. If I somehow do receive the 8 orders, I will uninstall the app",
            "The app is good, but it needs more adjustments, like the \"add to cart\" button and the \"place order\" button. I think it would be better if both buttons is in different position, because what if that customer of yours has accidentally double clicking the \"add to cart\" button, simply it will directly to \"place order\" button. and it doesn't have cancellation of order, you must add \"cancel\" button. And it would be nice if you add this app \"checking order\" before the order place it. Please notice.",
            "This app definitely need to improve. I am regular user. The rider and food list all has no bad experience. HOWEVER! I most frustrated is to find LIVE support help. When I need urgent help I cannot find anything. FAQ no answer. When click \"not answered\" it goes bacK HELP CENTER. It goes merry go round. I spent close to 1 hour and yet I cannot find. So I gave up. I have clicked on all available function. WHERE IS YOUR LIVE CHAT OR TEL CONTACTS!!!!",
            "Its great to order on cash on delivery but the ordering system needs more inproving and the gps as well. I constantly refresh just to see where my delivery guy is at. It's not a real time tracking monitor. And for ordering wanna get to see the pictures of the menu not just the words. Like i wanna see what i'm buying. But over all food panda is a good app."

            "It is very good, there is good editing in it, it is available for free in everyone's phone and it also looks good editing the normal photo, but it really takes backup so I liked it This is a gallery, it is very good to save photos and it also has edits, it really keeps updating, so keep updating it, then you get to see new features and I like it too That is why I did not force stop it and I am using it, I would give it 5 stars but due to the lack of any more good features, I will start it only 3",
            "I really can't say that I love the way this app works. It's not at all intutitive. There's such a disconnect between my sd card and my photos on my phone when I'm in the photos app.. I don't really get why this has to be so difficult? It'd be nice if every pic or video the phone has access to (on device or on sd card or in other apps, etc) would just come up when I go into the photos or gallery app. It's like a mystery I have to solve any time I'm trying to work with this app! Thx.",
            "This update is the absolute worst. No longer are the folders small, easy to navigate single pics, but now the first dozen photos from each folder, filling the entire screen, with a tiny label... I can't just tap a pic to open the folder, now I have to scroll through pages to find the folder I'm looking for - plus, other than \"camera,\" everytime I open \"Photos,\" the folders are going n random order - and there's no way to alter or customize the view. Thanks for making garbage! 👍",
            "mostly positive. i like that it keeps my photos on the cloud and that i can use google apps to switch info from phone to phone. but my pixel 3 had an issue with this app where it restarted randomly as i was backing a LOT of stuff up to the cloud and about a 3rd of the photos were corrupted when it started back up again, even on the cloud, even on my phone. also, it says in the description of the app that you can upload unlimited photos and videos for free but you really only get 15 gb",
            "Good. But we need an option where you can manually set some photos to be saved in full resolution and the rest in high quality (free tier). So that the pictures that the user don't want it compressed can be availed in full resolution but the other pictures can be compressed and saved in free tier without using up the GBs allocated to and account. Right now the entire gallery gets uploaded on full resolution, when you change the mode."

            "This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time",
            "Its actually relaxing. I see everyone commenting about the difficulty. It happens, but too me that's the point. Why would anyone want too play an easy game. I like my mind being massaged and 4 that reason, I will never quit. I'm on level 1850 something. I lost count. Lol. I do agree at times with winning more, but at other times because of my consistency, I get rewarded a lot of boosters too stay in the game. Use them wisely. Create your own strategy and you'll get ahead. Good luck everyone!",
            "Actually pretty fun. Glad I finally tried it after being bombarded with ads. Still don't know how they monetize this game...I've played as much as I want without being prompted to pay for anything. Graphics good even if storyline is a bit corny. UPDATE: ok...NOW I know how they make coin! They get some $10/month or so from me now. I'm hooked & too often stay up far too late \"just to win one more time.\" The deals can be pretty fair though, and I'd like to think playing keeps dementia at bay :)",
            "You know if you wanna win, you gotta have some tricks.. I'm sorry Gardenscapes, but I have to help them folks... Tricks to beat some level... 1. If you had played for several weeks but can't move up a level, try not to log in for a few days... After that long period, try logging in, and see what Austin have in store for you.. I mean, free gift... 😅 2. Try to create as many boosters as you can then if you're lucky those boosters might sit next to each other then you can make a huge blast!",
            "Fun game. If you want to burn some time, it's not bad. A puzzle game with quests. You literally advance to harder puzzles by doing quests. Still playing after 800 levels. It gets harder and you will need more specials like bombs and rainbow wheels to get past the Super Hard levels or you will start to get frustrated as you will need luck on these maps more so than skill."

            "I like this app. A lot of good tracks and albums can be downloaded into the app and listened to offline. That's if you are subscribed to Amazon prime which is only $7 a month. I like that in the app there is an eq for different genres + a custom setting where I can adjust the bands on the EQ for best enjoyment of the music . Easy to navigate and user friendly app. For a lot of tracks, the lyrics are shown if you want.",
            "Try to stream a song, says it can't find on SD card?! Why would it be on the SD card if streaming online (5g connection mind you)? Ok, so I'll download it, wait, nope, won't make any progress. Just updated a few days ago, fixed nothing yet had the nerve to ask me to sign up for the monthly service?! Seriously, let me play the music I own properly and I might consider that in the future. In the mean time, get this sorted out please.",
            "What music? I can hardly play anything that I have in my music anymore, out of several thousand songs. The only thing that doesn't get auto-skipped are songs that I've got offline or the occasional song that HASN'T been made unavailable for some unknown reason. This has been an issue for months now, with no solution. As with other users, I have also had issues with the app crashing, upon attempted login or while listening to songs. Might as well use YouTube Music at this point.",
            "So unimpressed with this app, constant glitches, crashing. Try and use it to listen to a podcast while I walk the dog and it can't even manage a few sentences before it has crashed and I have to get my phone back out to touch it to start playing again. I have a very new modern phone if it doesn't work on this how would be it on an old phone with less power.",
            "Update: got update and still no \"play next\" option so i took away a star. The U.I. is garbage. A \"play next\" option after shuffling is a must. I hate having to go back and searching artists to find a song just to have that option. Also, being able to arrange songs more than a few spots at a time is a must. I've had songs cut out for several seconds at a time. Very annoying."

            "The app is super great but there's just an improvement I would like to see. It's about the touch option on my Bluetooth earbuds, coz it has an option that touching it once either play or pause the video. The pause function is working but the play isn't. It's working on VLC but I kinda like using your app coz it's much easier when loading subtitles. I know it's really not an issue, hence rating it 5 stars coz I can just play it on my mobile but just wanted to let you know on something to improve.",
            "I have been using only MX player on my phone for years but the recent update has messed up its navigation system. Reasons: 1. A new feature has been added to seek the video by 10 secs by double click and now I'm so much used to using it for play/pause & there is absolutely no way to turn this feature off. 2. When you try to seek the video by swiping screen or even by using the forward/backward button, it doesn't move ths video according to the customized settings. I'm using it Note 9 btw",
            "Please Add Subtitles option for movies added in Mx Player. It will be good development in app to enhance user experience. Right now only online Subtitles available for playing movies from our folder. Already added Websereies and movies please enable the subtitles option. In case if I want to watch Tamil movies or kannada movies there are subtitles available. Please develop this option for MX Player.",
            "This app is awesome... I've been using this app for 2-3 years by now. The local video player is amazing and the customization is beyond amazing. But there's only one little simple problem though, that you haven't fixed yet. The brightness bar. Yeah the brightness bar you gave is 15 point bar instead of a 100. And the lowest point in the bar isnt even the dimmest brightness of the handset. Please do this one upgrade as soon as you can. And do the same for the volume bar too while youre at it plz",
            "This has been a really useful video player. I'm able to watch some of my favorite movies which I didn't get to by downloading or via Youtube. It also has a great feature of synchronisation to fix the videos which are not synced correctly. It also saves me the trouble of seeking subtitles of movies and TV shows from the browser. But I gotta say the ads are way too annoying. Whenever I open it or pause a video while the mobile data is on ads get in my way. Fix this so that I'll be glad to give 5 ⭐"

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "This is a great app to record games with. There are some bugs that still needs to be fixed. 1) If you don't use it for a while the sound doesn't work 2) It lags for a while and it interupts your recording 3) It lags out of some games and just quits on you Those are the bugs that need to be fixed. Otherwise, Great app! Keep up the hard work.",
            "This app does everything it tells you it will do. I just find it very satisfying when your looking for a app and you download it and when you go to try it out its very easy to work it dont trick you into getting it and then u find out you have to pay for it for it to work. This app also dont have any kinks either from what i can tell. I give the person that created it a 5 star rating keep it up and make more apps that works this good.",
            "At first it WAS AMAZING i got hundreds of vids recorded by this app! But one day, I tried it with cutecut and had put the video there, then, the video had shrunk, same with my KineMaster(it happened on the day i downloaded it) I hope that this problem will get fixed immediately. Its one of my only recording app so I hope this will get fixed and work like the old ver. Please fix this! ♥️♥️♥️🇲🇾",
            "Love it! I have played many different \"Sky Car Simulators\" from Google Play. This one is among the best so far out of a dozen or more. There is also one out of ten from \"Unity\" that is close to this in quality. If only the two were to merge, they may be the best on the Market. I have been a pilot for many years in Alaska. This flying App is very realistic with the added benefit of what flying a real Sky Car may be like. There are some bugs in this one, yet hail to the developers!",
            "It's an excellent recorder. You can record in 2k at up to 60fps, which is fenomenal! My only issue is the limited amount of apps which support internal audio only. I really hate recording with background noise, and is not convenient unless you need to record your voice, which is something I'm not planning to do. I'm not sure if the apps themselves need to allow this somehow or the recorder simply can't do it now, but maybe with an update (I hope this is the case). It's great nonetheless!"

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "I've been using Google Maps for years, and update my timeline every day so I've got an accurate tracking record of where I've been. And then, today, I find that most of the data for this and previous years has suddenly disappeared (it was there yesterday). Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",
            "This had been one of the most useful apps I ever used. But for the last several weeks it is not responding. I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",
            "Stopped working. I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",
            "Terrible! Google maps has been my go to for years on every phone I've had now over the past week the maps won't load the addresses and won't give directions. I have uninstalled then reinstalled for under a minute temporary fix then it does it all over again. I can't get any numbers or find my way unless I zoom into the map and follow my blue icon showing where I am. If I didn't know how to read maps ill be f***ed. This is bad."

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "The app does lack some of the features from the version on the computer. Some of these are really annoying, especially not having title page formats. I'm trying to type a paper for my class and a nice looking title page would be great but nope, they don't have it. Another thing that's annoying is the fact there is no \"online pictures\" you can insert or even graphs. Like come on you have charts, why can't you have graphs too? Its just really annoying that they don't have the same features 😒",
            "I'd have given it a five if sth so irritating wasn't one of the main annoying drawbacks of using any Microsoft app in general. You literally cannot log back in to your account, \"supposedly\" being locked or any of the sort and you put your password over and over and it doesnt work. You follow the steps and go to the website to only get the same result and you try and try to log back in and you can't. And I HATE that about Microsoft. I hope you get this issue dealt with, I'd be utterly grateful...",
            "Absolutely love the mobile version if MS Word! It's very easy to use, works well with drop box and I love how I can continue writing and editing documents on my PC or tablet as if I hadn't been using the mobile version at all. I've had no issues whatsoever and fully recommend it.",
            "Word is a very good application software. It allows me to accomplish all of my necessary task with relative ease. The toolbars are functional and very relevant and easily accessed. My overall experience with Word Application has been very enjoyable as it allows me to accomplish All of my necessary task. Most of my difficulty with the application is due to external forces such as supernatural phenomenon interfering with my progress, hence the reason for a 4 star rating and not a full five Star!",
            "Although the app is really good and easy to use you are out of luck trying to edit any doc if you are using a 12 inch tablet. It makes no sense that I am able to edit a doc (granted basic functionality but for many enough) on a 10.5 inch tablet but on the 12 inch you can only view docs as read-only and need a 365 subscription to edit. This is also the case with PowerPoint, Excel and even the all in one Office app👎👎. Really shortsighted for Microsoft when they're so many other alternatives."

            "3 stars, but with upvote. I love this app. Nothing more has to be said. The only reason you dont get 5 stars: *The app is and always has been a bit quirky neither a good or bad thing. *It's slow, gets bugged easely, and can crash without you even trying to do so. *Maybe make a survey for your users, so they can give you free feedback on what could be better or advanced. (User for more than 6 years)",
            "Most confusing app ever. They need to hire a pro UX designer because the app is a labyrinth. Select coupons seem great, but then it's a huge pain in the arse to find what you want from a store that is also accepting them. You basically will be stuck in the app forever to get $2 off. The sellers I've worked with are responsive, some products are great and others are trash. It's a new frontier.",
            "I love it. It's a great app and I cam find almost anything on here. The only problem is that many items show up on my feed that aren't even available for delivery in my country. I suggest you add a feature where we can filter out where items can be delivered to. Also the \"free shipping\" button only works for certain countries but I want to see products that have free shipping for my country. I think this needs work so that it's not misleading to customers.",
            "Pretty much has become a scam after the covid outbreak. Goods either don't arrive or arrive 8 months later (my case). App design has made it difficult to navigate, as it does with each update. Currently losing a dispute because it seemes like protection time hadn't expired, while there is no way to see protection time anymore, or I couldn't find it because it's hidden away somewhere in the awkward app design. I loved AE so much. Hope this isn't the end of you.",
            "At first glance the app looks great and probably is for people living in USA or Europe but for countries like India, even though the prices look really cheap, the shipping charges on almost all the products are double the original cost. And so the ultimate price is even more than high end products. Lots of other apps are available that dont have this issue."

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",
            "Great game ever but it had a connection problem and more of bugs after this update please resolve it. And other thing is that we want to purchase diamonds there is no other way. And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

            "App is nice, but you really need to fix the wrong lyrics *problem*. Especially as you require one to actually WATCH advertising in order to not pay!! Worse, it's seemingly to be a DAILY requirement! (& I'm looking for my rusty razorblades now, I'll need them, before weeks end, to slash my wrists!) The player is great, but this quirk is more than humankind can stand, & stay sane! Thought my search for music player was over, but no. Player itself is easily worth the 5 stars. Policy not so much.",
            "Great app I found it the best player. but one thing annoying me that it would grab any video clip from any app and list it or store it or save it without permission. and it will list all the audio and video clips that I have in my mobile, thats not good. For example, sometimes I want to listen to or watch a clip in messenger or whatsapp but I don't want lark player to store it. that what needs to be corrected. restrict lark player not to list or store or save any clip unless I choose to save it",
            "please set Equalizer with 5 band mode including amplifier for right and left ear phone volume adjuster is a must as other and my inbuilt mobile music player app is provided, then only this app can be used as default in connection with Snaptube app.Try to update the above feature as I requested for users friendly and ensure from your end to make effective positively to continue to use this Lsrk music player as a default player . Reply in English only.I can not understand your language so please.",
            "It's a great app, now that Google play music is getting shut down I have moved to this app and it's great, they're is just one problem. I can't find the shuffle playlist/music button, I can only listen to the music in a specific order, if there is a shuffle play button can someone please tell me where it is and if there isn't can lark player do something about this, thanks in advance",
            "Pretty good replacement for Google Play music and it plays all my songs I have but an add to queue function would be nice if I wanted to listen to the same five songs on repeat and a way to sort music from a-z, newest to oldest or something along the lines of that would be cool too but unlike the other music apps I tried this is one of the few ones I found had widgets which I use all the time."

On the other hand, on another device, this app crashes every time I try to move photos to a different app, is slow when doing anything else, and ends up wasting my time.",

I can open ANY file from pretty much ANY device! Word, power point, excel, etc.! I find that impressive. Especially since it's Microsoft.

            "Setup trying, should be made easier. Sometimes it takes days for uploads. Amazon is good for auto uploads. Making sub- albums is nonexistent (I used to keep info on leases, rent receipts, complaints, etc. in separate albums then group them under 1 album). Even Google changed that capability. I can't deal with these egomaniacs deciding what to do with my pics.",

You cannot tell if file is modified until you open and inspect it. This problem is unique to Android version. Works correctly on all other OneDrive apps on other platforms (IOS, Windows, etc)."

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "Full of bugs, why replace a working app with this? Too many bugs to cover. Volume drops until the app decides to randomly pause. When expanding from letterbox to fullscreen, the aspect stays in full screen untill it pauses randomly, then, when play is pressed it stretches across the x axis, leaving the black border of letterbox while stretching horizontally. On top of that, I have never had a smooth experience trying to download and of my 250+ purchases.... Wifi or cellular",
            "Just installed itself one day. I can't uninstall and if I try and put it in a folder the next time I open my phone it always reappears somewhere else on my screen. I don't need ANOTHER streaming service. Y'all already rich, you don't need another app, especially since I didnt want the app to begin with, nor did I approve its download.",
            "One thing that I like about it is that I can limit my searches to only \"free\" movies, so it limits it to my current subsctriptions, but it would be nice if you could do that same limitation when browsing by genre. I have so many subscriptions, I'd like to limit my browsing to those subscriptions. Also, how is YouTube TV not one of the supported services? You're literally the same company!",
            "Disappointed! This review is for the Google TV dongle. I was excited about it. But it hasn't lived up to expectations. My biggest drawback is the lack of \"Continue watching\" on most apps. This device was supposed to consolidate all of my contents in one place but it doesn't. I hope an update can rectify it. The outlay and ability to disable contents from apps one doesn't use will be great.",
            "I like the upgrade, but when I'm offline, it doesn't want to show my TV show library. Instead, it says \"Start your own collection\". I already have a collection. It can show me my movie library, but not my TV show library. It doesnt even show the content I've already downloaded to watch offline, unless I get connected to the internet to do so."

            "Awesome game. Its addicting. Definitely keeps you on your days. I would like to add, although I love this game, it would be nice to receive new cards more frequently. I spend billions of coins on chests to keep receiving duplicates every time and only to receive new cards needed far and few between. I do not pay to play. I like to play within the game itself. So please fix this issue to make the game more enjoyable.",
            "This game is fun, addictive and expensive. I take issue with the amount of coin packs that I purchase back to back to get to the milestone...weather it be village, set or next spin award. Example .. between this morning and last night I purchased over 20,000 spins$$ to get 16k & I still haven't gotten to 16k. I know this is how you make your money and I am just one person. But I guarantee there are thousands of us who feel this way. I know that I will keep coming back but loosen up already!!",
            "I really like this game it's real addictive and fun to play . The only problem I have with coin master is when you get up to village 100 and higher, I think when you finish a village that high up, you should get at least a gold chest and at least 100 spins. As it is now a wooden chest and 25 spins. It should be more because it is really difficult to finish a village and it just gets worse the higher you get. Other than that I have no complaints. \"GREAT GAME\"",
            "This game is DUMB. The tutorial doesn't take you through a full level and after the 5 minute tutorial you are left to wait an hour for another spin? It doesn't explain what the levels are, what you want when your spinning or why. There are lots of pop-ups to get you to buy stuff. Very very slow and totally boring. Not sure how anyone could play long enough to want to spend money. I installed this to get points for another game for getting to level 7 village, that will take a month! Uninstalled",
            "Its getting boring. No excitment. Its one thing over and over. Viking quest is next to impossible now with the absurd cost. Enjoyed it at first now its just lose coins and the bonus wheel is rigged to the point where it gives you no rewards. Thinking of deleting game. My wife and daughters already deleted. I tried to stay and see if anything changed but sadly not. Thanks for making it fun at first."

I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",

I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",

When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",

When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

            "One of the Best apps for chatting and texting. I got a lot of my old friend together because of discord. The only thing that needs fixing is The Voice Calls, this happens to me sometimes. I will be in a voice chat for a few minutes, or hours. Suddenly, it will stop transmitting my Voice. Other times. It will kick me out of the call completely, but discord is great overran. And it usually is ok with calls!",
            "Oh my god this update is awesome! It even removed the bug for which I put a 2 star rating. I'm really sorry developers I didn't tell you the problem, I didn't see your reply! I kept getting kicked out of Discord after talking to some friends of mine and this happened quite often. But now downloading it after a long time it seems to have been gone! You did a great job, keep it up!! This app will be a huge success :))))",
            "Very convenient for finding large communities around any subject. I love being able to talk with my friends in a small group chat, or in a large server with fun bots. The premium features are certainly worth it for anyone that spends a majority of their time within the app. However, all premium features are a monthly, or yearly payment. This is not very convenient for those who don't have a steady source of income. There should be an option to get minimum parts of premium for a single payment.",
            "Most of the times it doesn't work without headphones, however if I use it in another smartphone it does work. Something that I've experienced is that while you're in a call, it mutes or something like that, so I have to get out of the call and get in again, this \"mute\" happens while I'm not touching the phone and quitting the call is the only solution i've found",
            "Hello. Whenever I have discord open (browser or app), I completely lag out of games and my discord client, and it causes my web browser to stop responding. Without discord open, I never experience lag. Also, while in both browser or app, I'll suddenly be completely unable to speak in discord, but can hear everything that other people are saying. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm dying for a fix. I love discord, but it's been basically unusable for the last couple weeks."

            "Usually I have to use a different app for each task, map, or appointment to accomplish all I need to do. With this app, I can make my call, add an appointment, view the location via google map, see who's calling, block spam calls AND spam texts all from 0NE app. And i'm discovering much more I can get done each time I use it. I was so thrilled I coughed up the ten bones to get rid of the ads. Update: Wow! This App is SO amazing! Now using the app for a few days. You guys are freaking geniuses !",
            "Extensive, very detailed and lots of features. I am slowly discovering all features of the app. Recordings this far are good. To.remove adss @ $8 is a little steep. I say charge less and forgo the enticement of the 2 free gifts which a person may not want such as my case I want to buy the app but don't need the gifts...",
            "Great app, does everything it says and more, you won't be disappointed, the only one thing I I hoped for was to no who was in my profile but it didn't have it in my region, except for that everything is brilliant,well this is a year ago I wrote this, I noticed my review, I still have this app and its amazing in every way, I really don't think I could go without it, definitely worth installing, easy to use and it has beautiful colours and lots more.",
            "It's a great app but the call recorder does not store the recording names but shows private number even though the name of the caller is stored on my phone. I have a huawei P30 lite 2020 and I have upgraded to premium. I would like to see the name of the caller in call recording. How do I fix this?",
            "Extremely disappointed...calls are recorded but there's no audio when playing back. I downloaded the app to ensure calls are recorded and that it can be accessed when needed, and now I can't hear the audio of a very very critical recording."

I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

            "This was a great app. I used to be able to navigate through my downloaded episodes in a single swipe. Now it takes a couple taps to get to my downloads... Annoying, but I can live with it. More recently, the app won't download new episodes of my favorite podcasts. It churns and churns, and eventually shows an error. I've tried clearing the cache and force stopping the app, but no improvement.",
            "At first, I didn't think I would like the change over. But so far I am loving it!❤ These are the things I like: Being able to see other podcasts that interest me, with this Covid 19 many of my subscribed podcasts are not able to broadcasts regularly, so now I have my regulars and new ones.🤣 Having watched podcasts automatically deleted after a period of time. This is what can be done in the Settings section. 😍Now I am loaded with great podcasts!",
            "Pretty decent. Navigation and appeal would be greatly improved by implementing simple colored and semi transparent boxes/containers. With the current b&w layout the look and feel is muddy and immediately makes you want to look for other options. If you stick around to play with it, you get yourself used to it. No good reason why it needs to turn you off before you even give it a chance.",
            "The app is currently unusable. It won't update available podcast episodes with new releases, and I know others having the same problem. This isn't the first major problem I've had with the app either. In the past, there were serious audio issues, which were eventually resolved. Overall it's poorly maintained, and I'll be moving on permanently to other apps.",
            "I was going to raise my rating when I figured out there was a \"sleep\" function, but I really dislike the new home page layout. I liked the grid and ability to order podcasts. One line bar across the top is a pain to scroll through since it appears to go in I assume newest update order (which is not how I choose what to listen to). Edit:Getting used to the crappy layout but until there is the ability to add an rss feed I will not change my rating. Also the ability to rate podcasts would be nice."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

Since the update, pages do not load, it does not inform how many tabs are open, the open tabs do not show when looking through them, and it sticks on one page unless i close it down.

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",

I would like to appreciate this game. But sorry, I will give only 4 rating because you need to improve this game with more fun. So sorry but please do improve it. The game is so awesome. I liked this game👍👍👍",

The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people more😜plaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Overall not a terrible app. has good films and shows on it. One thing that keeps on annoying me is that every time I open the app it reminds me about the profiles feature even tho I have already set up a profile on it. Also what's with the adverts, I am already paying £10 a month I don't want adverts. I get that you are promoting your new shows but put them at the end so when I exit the show give me a recommendation for a new show to watch. I know I can skip the adverts but it's just annoying.",
            "Generally first rate. The apps weak point is with no (or a weak) WiFi signal. Then when you go to play a previously downloaded show, you may get a license error. The license errors come in groups. Connecting to WiFi doesn't fix the problem. Deleting and re-dowloading the show will fix the problem. Sometimes it fixes a group of them.",
            "Almost great. No way to rate content. Unfortunately a lot of content is not available in original language. In Switzerland we have German, French and Italian as major languages so it is hit and miss if a film or show is in a language you speak even if it was originally made in English. Bohemian Rhapsody is only available in Italian, Electric Dreams only in German. Curiously Buffy the vampire slayer is only available in English. Netflix has original plus German, French and often Italian.",
            "The good things about prime video is it is a good deal for a lot of perks. The prime video library is really good too. Now the bad things The app is buggy at times. Sometimes when I close the player it returns to episode menu but is stuck there unless I go back to homepage The video player opens in seperate window and when I'm switching applications I can't tell which prime video window to select in recent apps window. The windows app is even worse, downloads expire as soon as I download them.",
            "It's an app deserving of 5 star rating all right. But this is an updated review because I am unable to stream in full HD on my LG G8x. I've checked the phone just to be sure and it supports Widevine L1 plus all other streaming services like Netflix are able to play HD content on my phone except this app. Please fix this. It's a frustrating experience and no one is even responding to my emails or feedback"

            "This app is great. One thing though. I just wish the consistency with the refacing was better. I feel it depends on the picture taken and used. Doesn't compketely replace the actosr face to resemble your face. Some of the clips seem like they do not change a bit. Is there a way to better the consistency of the refacing? If so, then I would give the app a 5 star rating. Thank you",
            "I got the pro initially. After using it often I was told the unlimited was available. I was charged for both. Upset I emailed your customer service : Hello. As far as I understand, you're using an Android phone. You should try reinstalling the app, this usually helps On Sun, Oct 25, 2020 at 3:11 PM adavsamuel wrote: I signed up for the pro, but if I upgrade to unlimited will I be charged for both in a year.

            "At first the app is fine and its fun to use. I didnt mind the fact I had to wait seven minutes to use it again but the second time I have to wait half an hour? The moment you open the app it already asks you to pay to use it which is annoying. I have no issues with how the app runs, but its how they try to make you pay for using it that annoys me.",
            "I really love this app I'm having so much fun! My only problem is accessing my gallery. The lag time is RIDICULOUS I can only see about 20 pics and the rest are just black. Any suggestions? UPDATE: 10/30 After messaging a few times and Uninstalling and reinstalling the app I am really enjoying it. The longer videos are great!",
            "Fun app but minus 1 star for two reasons... 1. Kept me up all night. Had I paid for the full version, I could have been sleeping most of the night but I had to support the app by watching 30 second ads before each reface. 2. I get the ads but maybe not before each reface, maybe every other one. At least change the ads up a little. Most of the time you're watching the same ad like that's going to make me buy the product. Anyway, it's a fun app. If you really like it, pay for it."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "It's an ok game.......believe me, I love it! But the glitches are tooo much! Can't even hold it! I try to think that's it's just a mistake we can't do anything about it but the glitch level is really too much. I can't handle it anymore! Pls fix it! Hero dash is much better, try to make this game like tom hero dash. And are you serious? 6 hours of waiting just for unlocking a silly vault in a game? The torture is too much. Very mad 😫😵😢👿",
            "This game is really fun and it helps me get past time. Theres just on problem. This is neither happening to me or a few people. When I try to cross over to a different neighborhood through the tunnels I some time go under the road and it lags or theres some kind of invisible wall. Anyways its probobly just my internet. It's a great app. I would say the same thing for talking tom hero dash but leave out the tunnel part. That game is fun too. And a bit better.",
            "This is an amazing app! I love how its wifi free too! Idon't have any problems with it, though, sometimes the app IS a bit glitchy, but that has only happened a few times. At the moment, i am on the second tom up! I DO have a few things you could add to this game such as double jump and add more themes like underwater. I like the under ground bits where you turn up in a whole new world like the skateboard one, in the air, the sewers and ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER!",
            "This game is so cute😊 and cool at the same time. You can get characters like Tom,Angela,Ginger,Hank&Ben that's so cool and when you are running you can even go to different worlds like the underwater world,the dessert etc. The game play run smooth when you dob't have on you're wifi or you're service. This game don't let you stay on one running bath tou can go to different parts.",
            "Very adorable and fun game! Great way to pass time! All the characters are very cute and I smile everytime I play. I love the skateboarding part!Quite a cheaper version of Subway Surfers but much much cuter. But I don't really like the controls. Please make them more sensitive, or improve them overall."

            "This is a very good app that will allow you to get whatever job you need done. My only two issues are the few number of fonts, the fact that you can't edit the position of photos after you place them, and also for some reason if you put too many photos often some of them will begin to blur. Very frustrating, but for a mobile photo editing app this is probably the best one you can find without having to pay."

            "My experience with this app was really great. Its the perfect app for online study and calls. I just have one suggestion. Sometimes when we are asked a question which has a yes/no answer but its not always possible to unmute and answer so if its possible can we get a yes/no option for fast and direct response.",
            "Works very poor on mobile phone app when it comes to Teams calls. One can only listen and not speak well on a Teams call while using the mobile app. Also when searching for a message, it takes to the latest messages in the conversation and not that particular message being searched. Works on heavy data transfer.",
            "It is a really good app. I hope you continue to update it and make it better. But there is one problem. Since the starting of this week, there is a glitch for the teachers in the school that disallows them to join the meeting and sometimes even the app. I have given it Four stars cause it is very annoying and we students can't study properly. If this situation is fixed I will give it a five I swear.",
            "Great Online Meeting App.. But there is this thing that I would like to request the developers to add in Teams that there should be an option to delete an entire conversation with a specific person. We have to delete every single message to vanish the whole chat. Try to add this feature also to make it work more flexibly Overall nice application.. keep it up 👍🏻🤟🏻",
            "Teams is a good app. But there is a problem with the app. The app was fine but after the latest update, I can't join any meeting. I have a stable network. I tried signing out and signing in, but that also didn't work. Whenever I click on join button, it is showing that, \"Your call dropped and we couldn't reconnect\". So, I deleted it and installed an old problem free version. Edited : Now there is no problem after updating to the latest version. Thanks for solving the issues."

            "I really love Pinterest, it's a great source of dopamine for my ADHD brain. But more and more frequently I'm having trouble saving Pins. They take FOREVER to load (sometimes they don't load at all) and if the Pin isn't fully loaded it won't let me save it to my boards. Also, why can't I search for other people's boards anymore?? Please bring that feature back!",
            "I love this app. It is exceptionally handy, simple to use and much more. It has most of the topics ranging from celebrities, Do It Yourself (D.I.Y) , and many many more. It also helps me to pin the photos, create new boards, looking for new ideas and many more. Thanks for your kindness, helpfulness and keep it interesting. So, keep on improving. I will be looking forward to see many more topics. As I always replying politely, stay home, stay safe and have a great time.",
            "This app has been great in so many ways and I love it. But lately the app keeps crashing. It doesn't stay open for more than 2 seconds and as someone else mentioned, it does stay open in the background. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I switched my cell off and on again. Cleared cache and even did a deep scan of my phone. But nothing seems to be working. Hope the issue gets resolved quickly.",
            "This app was pretty good. I've been using it for 2 years. But lately the app has been crashing very much. It does stays open for more than 2-3 second. Also when i am using any other apps then suddenly a thing pops out saying \"Unfortunately, pinterest has stopped\" . I have seen that others are also facing this same problem. If you can then please repair it asap.",
            "Idk what the hell is going on, but it will go from allowing you to scroll to not allowing anything but moving up and down the pin. You have to back out of the pin you're on, which is possibly really are far down or closer to where the LAST time it stopped letting you scroll, and have to go all the way to the pin you were on. THEN it'll stop scrolling like three pins. Or five. And it needs to be fixed before I change my review. Even updating it didn't fix the issue, if anything it got worse."

And when I change the font, the doc has to be refreshed in order for it to reflect the new font. Much inconvenience.",

Can you make it so of your writing a story to have the option to have book pages that you can adjust the size cuz im writing a story and i wud LOVE that option. Also not just for storys but for essays and stuff. Would be great for printing 2 so you know size of page. Also have spelling corrections. Thanks google!!",

            "Good it is, Easy to use , i also like the fact that their items are hardly out of stock and the fact that most of their items have variety of colours to choose from...i also like the fact that each an every item has atleast 5 pics of showing us how it looks like . And the reason why i didnt give it 5 stars its becouse of their delivery amount, its too expensive .",
            "Very easy to use and so far the clothing quality has been pretty good. I have 4 stars because I think more work should be done on the website interface to make it adapt to pc better. It's very difficult using Shein on my laptop. Additionally, I would love if the Taiwan site can add an option to change the language (although billing and clothing descriptions and searches are in english), the headings are in chinese. The sizing is sometimes wayy off. Always use reviews to try to gauge your size.",
            "I love this app. I think it is super easy to use. I also think it works way better than the website. No matter what device I am on, the website seems to be kind of difficult and slow, but the app is much faster and easier to use. Plus the prices of everything are so low! If you love shopping for things that are inexpensive bit still great quality, this is the app for you.",
            "This app has all the things you never knew you need! Clothes, accessories, home gadgets, even a few things I use in my salon i love it all! When I look up dresses it gives me an option for modest dresses, what a great feature! I'm a mom and proud of it, so there is no need to flaunt too much chest or super high cut dresses, thanks Shein! Everything I've ordered through this app has been great quality and even better prices! Highly recommend!",
            "Pretty good! So genuinely this app is really good. Definitely WAY better then Forever 21. There are so many good deals and cute clothing! The clothing looks like the pictures on the app! I've seen only good reviews. I haven't ordered anything yet, but definitely get this app!! ❤❤"

Secondly, the presented screen is small, which is quite disturbing and disappointing. And sending of messages is so difficult and different. Besides, checking infos, links are quite difficult. I am not able to see the participants in a meeting. In short, not so user-friendly. Please fix this and update to previous version. The previous version was much better. Thank you.",
            "The former version of this was better. Ever since my google meet updated, it did not allowed to me join peacefully. It just kept saying either \"Failed to join the meeting\" or \"Cannot connect you to a video call\". It really irritates me, in a way that I'am the President of our class and it's very humilliating for me not to attend. I really HATE the new version. It works on my other relatives phone, but I don't have the chance to ask them to lend me their phone even 'cause they are using it.",

Please fix this. Seems like this is happening to my specific device model. Edit: After the latest update, it's working fine. Still the 3 star to bring back the old UI.",
            "The recent update is worst!.. Trust me, I am not able to handle this new version of Google meet. I was struggling to find where the chat section was and from where to send messages. I have to zoom each and every thing presented on the screen. The screen looks too small. Once you go in the chat section,you are not able to see the screen. The old version is way better than the new version. Please bring back the old version. Please!",
            "The latest version is the worst and it's a shame considering the app was already great. Typing a message is very frustrating with all the names entering and leaving the meeting appearing in front of the message, this could be solved by putting this feature in the top instead, sometimes your message hides behind the keyboard. This version also doesn't allow to see the chat at the same time as the meeting. Please comeback with the older version and we will all pretend this version never happened."

I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "Skype is my go-to video call app. I've been using it for many years, to stay in touch with family and friends. My daughter used it for years for piano lessons and helped us stay in touch with her piano teacher when we moved. My elderly parent was able to learn how to use it. I use the call feature to reach family and friends in the UK, Hong Kong Indonesia, add Canada inexpensively. I also appreciate not having to set up a link in advance, I just dial and get on.",
            "The majority of the time the audio is good and the video is good but a significant percentage of the time the video freezes and the audio is unable to be understood. The other problem is Skype does not seem to work with Firefox and Firefox is my browser. The the biggest Improvement I think that I could make make would be to make it compatible with the latest version of Firefox",
            "Skype; a communication app we have been using since the earlier days of internet. From calls to messaging, or even getting a second number--this app is really all you need. Be it your desktop PC, laptop, or smartphone--the app will give you similar experience on all different platforms. The international call rates are quite price competitive. You may also add balance and use it as you go. Highly recommended!",
            "Works well for video calls - of course it requires a good internet connection. Occasionally the video will halt for a moment, and once or twice the audio has dropped out. Usually there are no problems. Update: I wish the developers would prioritize the audio. It's usually not a problem if the video freezes briefly, but too often the audio drops out completely.",
            "Works great.... most of the time? So many times messages are delayed because Skype says \"no connection\" even though I have Fiber Optic internet, 895 Mbps connection at the moment. Sms, and othe aps work flawlessly. Unfortunately I get this message multiple times a day which tells me there's an issue with Skype servers. Please fix so I can stop closing the app, clearing the cache and reopening 10x a day!"

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ☹️"

It's the only part of Facebook I use and they managed to muck it up.",

When will fb ever learn? If there is no definition for the app. I will not upload it. I have to go to my frigging insights to do an edit on my spiritual angel page! One star is 2 much 2 give.",

Please, please, please..... It's a humble request...",

Also add the reply function and the option to unsend messages. Lastly, sending a file is such a good feature of the app that also should be added to the main app, but please improve it by retaining the actual file name of the files we send instead of changing it to randomly generated name and numbers. Thank you.",

            "Just recently updated my Google Calendar app, but the logo remains the same. It did not change into the new one. Also, I find it very interesting that the app's logo matches with the date that I finally noticed my Google Calendar app. What a coincidence! I even thought that the logo is real-time before I learned that the 'date' or the '31' is actually part of the standard logo.",
            "Until a few years ago it was bad, now it's way more than that, now it's horrible. :) Simple task of sharing and unsharing calendar with other people is either missing or requires more than 10 minutes to locate in the app options. Whatever takes more time in an app than on a laptop makes zero sense as a function of an app. Keep it simple. It's a calendar app.",
            "What's with the new icon. Must admit, not a fan of the new icons for Gmail or calendar. They just look like the branding/marketing team have taken over any they no longer look like they represent a symbol for the apps functionality rather a Google something. I'm beginning to question Google's direction with the inconsistent pixel experience now this garbage...",
            "I have been using this app for many years, however, the new goal-setting function is very inconsistent. I will set a goal to occur every day, and it will skip random days, with no way to re-include those skipped days. It also does not let you define the duration of your goal, which is quite daft. Goals must have dates in order to be effective. The 'smart' notifications are pretty silly; they remind you to complete your goal, and have an option to tap 'later', which defers goals by a whole day!",
            "New update hijacked my Outlook calendar & added notifications for all events, despite NO NOTIFICATIONS set in BOTH Outlook AND Google Calendar app. Update also caused Samsung Calendar to also trigger alarms for Outook events despite being previously disabled as well. Dev's suggestion to cancel alarms in Google app 1 by 1 for each Outlook event is not a fix. As I stated, NO NOTIFICATIONS is the default, so there's nothing to turn off when new events sync."

            "This vpn was amazing for the first year I used it. It was truly a 5 star app due to its fast speeds, eazy connection, and security. In the last months or so... The vpn has been heavily reducing my wifi speeds. Like a tab in chrome will take 20 seconds to load. As soon as I turn it off...1 to 2 seconds max to load. Not sure if the company is reducing costs or what...but its not usable anymore because it really bogs down the wifi and will buffer through youtube videos or online movies.",
            "***ACTUALLY*** 4.5 STARS I don't often rate anything, unless it is astoundingly terrible, or amazingly superb. And this time it is the latter of the two. I paid the nominal couple of dollars for the premium version, and it has almost exceeded my expectations. I even had to get a replacement phone from at&t and couldn't get anything from my old destroyed device, but I re-downloaded app, and still got premium version. Only issue is several locations are permanently full even though I pay for them!",
            "I have a paid subscription. But when I downloaded it it doesn't recognize it. How do I resolve this? Stop using this for a few months and use something else because It doesn't recognize the subscription. I prefer a refund to be honest because this is much slower than other VPNs out there. Actually I want my money back I have spent too much time trying to get this stupid subscription to take away the useless ads. I'm not paying $35 for something that doesn't work. The developer not contacting me.",
            "it works well for me. though it gets disconnected easily, but well.. i don't really care since i use it for free, so yea i don't mind to have to reconnect it every time it got disconnected. oh and i hope you can lessen the ads though i don't really mind abt it bc as soon as i connected to the vpn, i immediately close the app and i can avoid the ads without problems.",
            "The best vpn it's totally working(but not on crunchyroll they're too smart they blocked because my ip is weird shhhh)5 star's ain't enough other vpn doesn't work but this one does 💯 Percent recommended(I really wish youd add a little more free countries but it's fine I only use ameria)The best I wouldn't care if you would add more ads just to keep this app running and working uhhh can't express how happy I am."

            "Use to be great but now when editing documents the words jump around to different areas miles from where you are typing. Last update didn't fix this issue and has created many more. Some documents have gone missing, tells me I need to upload already saved files when you try to open them, uploading creates two copies then if you save the newest when you reopen it asks if you want to open the new document and opens in the old file!!! Hours of work lost.",
            "It has very nice features and plus it gives; any benefits like creating forms of our choise... It can be of checkbox, multiple choice. Etc But there should be effects like darkning or lightning the presentation or any other thing to make without upgrading to the premium....... And also without buying. It should be free and there should be more creative templates.",
            "Used to be a good app until the last update now basic functions are just for the premium accounts and it's more bombarded with ads and that's just frustrating. Fix this or put me on the previous version. I still like the app, if you can fix these issues in the next update I'll be glad. Thanks🙂",
            "It's an mediocre app , it lets me view any pdf files that the in-built pdf app imln my mobile doesn't let me see. But, I'm willing to bet that there are many more good apps than this one, it doesn't even let you share pdf files without the premium version. In short : It's a good app for just viewing and editing pdf files, but I wouldn't suggest i for professional or daily use.",
            "Was good and bought 1 year Premium but all of a sudden they start to give me adds again. And its started to change some of my documents to different format like Chinese and diamond shapes. This app is now pretty useless. Spent 2 days rewriting my documents and 24 hours later they changed back to different format again. Extremely unhappy"

In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "Loved this app until I got paid version. There are too few filers and it gets boring. None of the previous filters are in it, and I've seen many over the past couple of years. The fun section still only does side by side comparison instead of the whole picture. I'm not sure why it's so expensive with so few features. What it does do, it does very well. Impressions and presets are almost identical, make up too. A few pre-made looks could do the trick e.g \"Beach babe\" , \"barbie\", \"dictator\"",
            "I absolutely love this app. There is honestly no better app of its type. A massive problem though, is that I couldn't pay for the lifetime membership :( - the monthly plan works, but i wanted the lifetime plan... I'm new to Android, so if it's something that I need to fix, can you please inform me. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, and added many different payment methods (all with enough money in the accounts) my problems aside, even the free version of this app is worth 5 stars.",
            "This is the first time I'm saying, \" Today, 22-10-2020, I'm declaring that if there is a option to give 7 🌟, then I must give that. Seriously 😘. This AI app is the best of best! If I want to change the face or other tasks it will take an hour in Photoshop. Thanks for giving us Pro feature using Ad. Stay happy all the time, take care and stay safe at home 🏡.",
            "I absolutely love this app! There are still so many features available even without the paid version, and they actually all look real!! However, I am encountering one issue. For some reason, the \"My kids\" 1 and 2 are taking FOREVER to load. I know it's not an wifi problem because all the other ones load just fine and my wifi is really good. I will definitely change my review to a 5 star once this is fixed, thank you!",
            "This app is very good. I love the option on the app that allows you to see what your future children may look like. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because of minor errors such as having the girls look like 80 year old men or making the children look more like girls in the boy part instead of boys. I also suggest that this app would be really cool if an anime option was added. I've seen videos on this, and I think it would make the app more successful and up in rankings! Thanks!"

Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

            "It's a brilliant app, especially for gachatubers like me. I kinda wish the way you could tween was easier, and looked more realistic. I'm not trying to be rude, I love the app! But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

Once my sister was playing and suddenly she got to see an add with an almost naked person. It's disturbing to see such things especially on a kids app. Please, the developers should look forward to it. Thanks.",

My 2 year old sister is very joyful about this application. Please add more updates and try to fix some bugs. Keep up the good work and never stop until you feel happy and pleased with your game. You're very amazing to help us with stress. I love taking care of Tom!",
            "I wanted to install the game again and immediately installed it... I used to love this game and now there afe THREE packages you can click to earn something by watching an ad and normally I don't mind that but they won't go away. They follow you in every room and it annoys me so much that the fun of decorating is taken by that... So no, not again... Pretty sad",
            "Never pass this game. All the comments about this were wrong. They don't know how to play and always loose so they give all of you a bad review. This is my suggestion do not leave this game. I was always on this game when ever i have time. You all would like it. And it's birthday's come very fast ❗❗❗❗and it level up also very faster. I love this game. There are some rumors about this game but they sre not true, when speaking of Talking Angela the things are true. I saw something in her eye. 🤗🤗",

It says my account already exists. Why are you guys making it difficult? Why isn't there a customer service centre or a quick helpline? It's frustrating when I want to use your app but can't because of this glitch. Can y'all please help me?",
            "I got a new phone so now I can't sign in since I don't have access to my old phone number. I would try and make a new account but someone is using my new phone number. I tried to contact customer support but they tell me to sign into the app and send them some information. Funny thing is, I can't sign in, that's my problem!! Worst customer support, all they have is bots that keep repeating the same things over and over, I'm honestly done, and Uber can suck me.",
            "App doesn't have a sign in feature that is easily accessible. I can't log in to change my phone number to my new one, because my email is in use. If I try to sign in by social it also locks me because email is use. This is a joke of a UX, use LYFT, this app and experience is trash.",
            "Previously i had booked many cab with uber. But now i dont know what is this otp thing that has come. Firstly the trip is not shown when i have already booked. I have to again do the booking so that trip info comes up. Next when the cab comes he asks otp. And this has been three time. I have even updated my app and rechecked the phone no too. But still i dont recieve any otp. So please look into it.",
            "It's very hard to get support from a real person, and even if you manage to do it (it's hidden behind layers and layers of FAQs, ridiculous) they're unhelpful af, and don't even understand the platform they're supposed to work with. I've deleted my account and uninstalled the app, and you should do the same unless you wanna go through hell when something goes wrong (it will)"

I just hope all my recordings you're taking is going to good use! I'd love to see some stats. It scares me how much you take on of everybody's lives when they use your app. Please be smart, safe and sensible with our lives 🙏💪🥰 #illgiveahigherreviewsoon",

I was finding a way to detect this song and i found the Shazam app it was a great pleasure to detect my interest song in just a seconds! Great job! It was useful to other people who wanted to find their fav song! I gave 5 stars ✨ keep it up shazam! ❣️",
            "EDIT: Tray icon added. Now I can instantly launch 5 Stars, like I promised, leaving my original review intact... OK so far... But I just want a button in the notification tray, I don't want the bubble on screen the entire time. Sure, I can move it around, but that's a pain. If there is some way to ONLY have something in the notification tray, it's 5 stars otherwise.",
            "I was using an app from sony on an old xperia but they discontinued the app, been using this for a year or two now, helps when finding a song from a movie or the show I'm watching, since upgraded to a new phone I get an issue now and again it keeps the app open and recording for songs apparently, manage to get it cancelled but it happens again over time",
            "Like many others, I'm uninstalling Shazam due to Shazam recently adding a persistent notification alert that can't be dismissed. Sorry Shazam, I don't need your un-dismissible spam cluttering my notification area, especially when I only use your app a few times a year. Whoever added the un-dismissible notification to the app deserves to be fired and never work in the tech industry again!"

            "Its good app for calling and all. But i wnt to add group chat shortcuts in my mobile desktop. But its not working for business whatsapp. And in delete chat data need options date wise or month wise delete. It will very useful for business. Pls do the needful. Need urgently. From last 1 week after new update it was not working. When i was forwarding or searching its not working. Asking for close or wait. Earlier update is good. Now is very worst. Pls update soon. Need urgently. No use. Reupdate",
            "I haven't been able to access my contacts for more than 2 weeks now. Some of my contacts suddenly went missing from my WhatsApp even though they're still on my phone 📱 I thought the issue was from my phone but I just saw another person complaining about it here. I use this account for business and most of my contacts view my status. Now how will I get people to view my status when they aren't on my list?🤷🏾 This is frustrating to be honest. Please do something about this.",
            "Not as convenient as I thought it would be. The whole point of me downloading this was so I minimize the stress of getting back to my customers late on my personal WhatsApp with the auto reply when I'm offline function but it's as useless because it doesn't work and I only receive messages from customers days later if I don't check the app now and again, it's not at all instant as the normal WhatsApp because there even if I'm not online, as long as I have internet connection, I will receive text",
            "please create a 'word done' option in the chat box. like we 'star' an important chat. same like that but the 'word done' status could be seen by the sender also. this will help us to know that the work that was assigned is done or not. it will save our time.🙏🙏",
            "Give us the option to block only calls from people. I dislike people calling me randomly when i don't want to speak. You could add a feature where you can block calls from groups or certain individuals undefinitely or for specific periods. We don't have to have only a block option that works if we block folks from both calls and messages. Thank you."

            "Good but needs updation There is no flexibility to change the font, size of the font, underline, highlight with color, etc. When we take a lot of notes we demand certain highlighting options that makes the important points to be visible. But this note pad, unfortunately doesn't have the feature. Also the theme should be flexible. Not everyone would love dark theme. Or not all the time dark theme suits. Perhpas what Google docs have should be incorporated in google keep too.",
            "I like this app too much, but any sequence of number it thinks is a phone number and suggest me to call it, but it isn't a phone number. It's very hard to edit line of numbers, because the app alway pop-up an window to suggest you to make a call, you have to click on edit, but if it was on the wrong spot then you'll have to click again, select edit. Always like that, can you guys fix it? I don't save phone numbers on Google Keep, I do it on contacts. 160 (14) /559 isn't a phone number.",
            "This is a great app with a wonderful user interface, but it would be good to have other fonts for use. Additionally, it would be good if we could change font sizes. Lastly, it would be good if you had the option to make the list only partly a checklist (if you press the checklist button it makes everything apart of the list, granting it a checkbox). Thanks! 👍",
            "Hey Google! I hope this isn't too much to ask for, for the Google Keep app...but When writing a note, the date & time is saved but when edited it changes and that's perfectly fine but I was wondering if u could still have the original date & time saved. For example, I wrote a note yesterday at 5pm & edited it this morning at 8am, but let's say I wanted to look back at the original time and date that I wrote the note on, I think it would be a good idea to tap on the edited date & time to see it.",
            "I personally love the app and I use it almost every day for everything. Though I think there are things that could be better. Like for example, a feature where you can protect notes with password/pin. I'd also love to see a feature wherein we can add more photos in whatever part of the notes we choose (not just one at the top). Also, the ability to change font size or at least make some texts italicized/bold. Would it also be possible to make a subtask under a subtask? Thanks a bunch!"

Now I cant even open up the app. When i attempt to do so, it just crashes every single time. I've already cleared the app data and cache via the settings but it still wont open up properly. Hoping to get this fixed asap before I have to stick with google chrome going forward. **UPDATE** Fixed a while ago. Best browser period",

However, as much as I do enjoy the fact that you can change how you want to display your tabs, the password for \"secret mode\" especially with a biometric scanner is genius in my opinion. However, I just wish the address bar was easier to use.. it feels like im using an old Samsung before mobile compatibility was a thing",
            "Samsung Internet is the best app ever seen It is easy to use and customizable settings. I loved it using this browser. I recommend all the others to use this app. But there is some drawbacks. It doesn't have settings for downloads like concurrent downloads. I would like if it is added in the next update.",
            "It works good and I like it! The only thing is you can only have 50 (or now 99) tabs open at once, so be sure to bookmark or save elsewhere any pages you think you want to go back and see again sometime. If it gets to 50 (or now 99) tabs open and you open another tab, the oldest tab will automatically be closed."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "There are lots of things I liked about this app like the ability to modify its appearance, but the autocorrect is really getting out of hand. Even though I've gone into the app's settings and turned off autocorrect, it's still changing every other word I type into something I have to go back, delete and correct. I'm just about giving up on texting or emailing from my phone now because it takes at least twice as long to clean up all the autocorruptions and retype. Is there a fix for this?!",
            "They've done something to The voice to text option and it is not picking up when I am using punctuation. Instead of inserting the punctuation it's actually spelling the word out. For example once I am done with the sentence if I say (period) ......before it would normally put a . (period) at the end of the sentence whereas now it spells the word out. it also does this randomly. it is a real pain and makes using voice to text very annoying and irritating!",
            "It's a great application except every time I do voice recognition it does not capitalize the first word of every sentence. Even though I have the setting to capitalize the word at the start of each sentence. how do I fix it? Now whenever I say period it spells out the word period instead of putting punctuation. Please fix that as well.",
            "Seems to be allowing a GIANT glitch in my operating system. Until recently I didn't have any problems, then I think something was updated and allowed a virus to be entered into my phone. This has happened before. I just started to uninstall applications until my phone started to work properly again. What a pain in my backside!",

Even when I try to make payment through Mobile number. Then it's take lots of time select the number or searching the number with right name. Payment by mobile number it's take 3-4minutes. I have real experience and I can show you recording of screen while I make the transaction.",
            "Not upto the mark. Sincerely speaking - most times it fails without any valid reason. Got the response from the developer. However worth to mention here that, in other payment modes including BHIM UPI, such failures are rare. But in PhonePe it is frequent and recurring. Makes one annoying. Not reliable.",
            "There are more failed transactions in my PhonePe history then successful ones. What has happened to this app?? None of the services work, mobile recharge fails, credit card payment fails, electricity bill payments fail, even simple UPI transfer also fail. These things have been failing frequently. There are just way too many updates, but it doesn't improve the overall service of the app. POOR!!!",
            "After using many other payment apps, I found PhonePe app very convenient. The transactions happen without any glitch and very quickly. I just wish if they can reward their customers with more cashbacks and rewards to encourage them to use it more often for all the financial needs. Thanks for the wonderful service.",
            "Starting , this app gives cashback either on lower amount or higher amount but now a days , it wouldn't give a single cashback on transferring up to 5000 . It gives coupon which is useless like play Rummy coupon , so I give 1 star bcoz , Rummy is bad game which destoyed many people life . Give cashback instead of coupon , Laura lassan. Also give some good offers , you given offers are not useful"

It so good, I completely recommend it, get it now! No ads disturb your watching experience either, and I really like that. You can also have multiple accounts for different people.",

Second issues is that it once in a while their is a minor lagg. . I think it had started about a week or two ago. But other than that, it perfect. I hope that they fix it ASAP.",
            "This used to work fine on my phone but now for some reason the audio in some movies stops working as the video plays, video stops and audio plays, or even sometimes both audio and video stop. I try skipping ahead and going back to my spot but it rarely fixes the problem, and if it does, its only fixed for a few moments. This has happened in numerous movies ive tried to watch so i try a different movie and the same problem keeps occuring. Its getting on my nerves. Please fix it quickly.",
            "Only thing I wish you guys implement is to add a proper video resolution selection option for both streaming and downloading. Just let us control the resolution that we need. You can definitely add an algorithm to reduce the selected resolution if the network doesn't support it. Apart from that everything is great. Just look at prime video. Their app is so good. This rating will change when a proper resolution selection tool gets implemented.",
            "My only complaint is the subtitle size. I switch between my phone and TV. I like small subs on phone and normal on the TV. It doesn't make sense that I can only change subtitle size through the web and not the app itself. It should be a basic function within the app. It's very annoying that everytime I want to switch devices I have to go through the web, which takes ages to reflect. Take some inspiration from Amazon Prime app. They let you change anything about the subs. Improve please."

            "It is absolutely really helpful. It helped me with alot of things like my module, homework, math, measuring, etc. I love this app and it's completely free! So what are you waiting for? Download now! This is probably the most awesome math problem solving app ever! #1 the best calculation app ever! I can't stop using it! This app is awesome and what i like about it is that it knows how to multiply and calculate everything which is awesome!",
            "It's the best maths solving app I have ever seen. I am not a premium user but I am happy with my experience with this app. It is not necessary to buy premium because an average math student can understand the steps provided by non premium photomath.I don't know how much the premium is good but if the non premium is this much good then premium will be outstanding. And the best way to get rid of ADS for a non premium user is don't turn on internet while using this app. But there's no deceptive ADS",
            "For me, personally, the app used to be better when explaining solutions, but it's still very good. I wish it would explain graphs however. There's no ads, however you have to pay for some features, but it's not bad to the point that the app loses value if you don't buy premium, personally, I haven't. Highly suggest",
            "Brilliant! This app is very helpful and useful! I used this to check my answers to math problems and equations and it showed me the correct answers as well as the solution too! Not only that, most of the features we all need in solving mathematics is in the app for FREE. Now I understand Math even better without the feeling the uneasiness of solving math problems and equations. I really love it.",
            "I liked the app ever since. It really helps me solve my math problems that gives specific and understandable solution. I deleted the app years ago, and now I installed it again. Ot surprised me knowing now, you will have to pay in order to access such as show specific steps. I'm kinda disappointed at the same sad. It does give you 7 days trial, but really I was expecting more."

            "Used to love this app. But lately more and more bugs seem to appear. For some weeks now we are unable to sync our devices. Always getting the response \"okay syncing devices for [names], sorry 3 things aren't available right now, you might want to try setting them up again.\" Trying setting them up again doesn't solve anything. Next up: We are quite invested in the Google ecosystem. But what I don't get is the nonexisting Android TV integration... How is this going to be solved?",
            "All of a sudden, I can't cast Spotify from my phone through Chromecast. Movie apps work fine, but suddenly I cannot play music, even though I have changed nothing in my settings and Spotify is set as the default player in Google Home. Settings are unintuitive and confusing, and each specific option is so difficult to find that it might take hours of exploring before you find what you're looking for. Please fix this as soon as possible.",
            "Frustrating! I loved my Google hub but decided to upgrade to a hub max. I ask it to do one thing and it does something else. The hand gesture does not work. Multiple problems with streaming. Max tells me I need to link my account even though I have done that. It asks me what I want to play my video on even though I have set the HubMax as my default display. I could keep going with problems that I have googled for help, gone to you tube for help, but can't get resolved. The app needs an upgrade!",
            "Not sure if this is Google \"home\" related or not. But in 2 weeks . 3 of my speakers died. One works if you stream to it. But does nothing else. 2 minis, now have all 4 lights dimmly lit and don't even register to add device. Since this new software update and other updates, things aren't working properly. Been trying to avoid Alexa for years. But at this rate a switch might be coming.",
            "The Google home app is Amazing! You can link cameras, Speakers, Thermostats and more! For example, I have a Google Nest Mini and a Nest Security Camera. I was able to link up both With No CONFUSION! You can also play and pause music on your speaker with just one tap of a Button! You can also take a look at the Security cameras! Keep it up Google!

            "It was all fine until I had to transfer to YouTube Music, which to listen to music properly, requires a subscription. But YouTube didn't transfer my music, it just didn't work, which is frustrating. They don't care about people's satisfaction in listening to music, they only care about gaining money through subscriptions. Google Play Music was good, see that key word, was. YouTube Music doesn't need my money so I could listen to my music. It needs better function.",
            "It was working fine. I could happily listen to music offline. I honestly think that YouTube Music is really pointless since there's already a bunch of songs, covers, and instrumentals on YouTube itself. This is only getting a 1 star review and I have no actual regrets. Honestly who was dense enough to think of this idea, they should've known that no one would like this idea, it's such a fraud. If we now need internet to listen to music then that's really dumb. Have fun reading all the reviews",
            "Used the app a lot from the get go. Worked perfectly. I put all of my purchased/downloaded music on it for about 3-4 years. Then, the app was \"moved\".... along with all of my music. 3 years worth of music erased completely. I'm pretty disgusted.... so much, that I don't even want to give YouTube music a chance once I saw that my music wouldn't transfer. Not one song. All of my playlist titles are there... but no songs. I've tried multiple times and searched extensively. It's a complete RIP off.",
            "I have been using this app for years, even I changed phones. And I am happy to use it even when offline. The last time I used this app was yesterday before updating. Then I realized the app is discontinued and becomes Youtube Music. The wonderful memories and arranged music just gone. Well, it is nice while it lasted and it's time to move on. Goodbye.",
            "This app was perfect. Loved the format. Very user friendly. Love the fact that I could play music on my phone while phone was asleep or when using other apps. YouTube music sucks . I have to keep my phone awake while using. Also I can't easily play my personal music downloaded to my phone. Ill pay for Google music if I have to. How can I get it back? F your commercials, F your format, change something that was flawless. I will never listen to any music on YouTube music."

A big downside to this app is it makes the exported video not as great of quality, but I think all the features inside capcut will more than make up for it!",

I would like this app to save the video faster (I understand it takes a long time but when I go off the app not closing it, it stop the save) And 2. More effects. Some of the effects I feel like I have to repeat too often. It's rlly fun but I would have to go on uTube to find a sound to use. Or save the video and find another app to add more filters. Apart from these 2 things I'm in love with this app! Keep it up!",
            "This is such an amazing app! It has a watermark, it's on the end part which is amazing. It pretty easy to remove which is great but I would love to tell people that I used CapCut. It has chroma key to me it's better than kinemaster in chroma key. It has an intensity and shadow, the shadow helped make the chroma key looked smoother. Finally an app that's has a watermark in the end of the video, it was a dream come true. If you are an average video maker download this I really recommend this app.",
            "Capcut is really good. There is no watermark on the front of the screen, only when your movie is finished and its good like that. There is chroma and many more cool features. The only problem i saw is that, you can only record up to 15min but that doesn't disturb me. Thanks Capcut",

Please fix this problem and I will give 5 starts if you do! Also when I export the project it's longer than 11-12 seconds and the music is playing like there is no bugs."

If this content can be separated, it will be very good because it will take less time for us to find the content. Thanks to you.",

I see latest updates in channels and chats but after I close the app and open it again, it send me notifications for that seen messages again and again! And the other problem is that I get the notifications for new messages but they don't load in chats and channels!!! It's so annoying... Please fix it .",
            "No way to delete my info. Installed to find no way to make calls. Very unclear about why the selected only 3 contacts to sync out of my list. Was hoping to be able to make voip calls but this does not replace a conventional messenger and phone. No dial pad. No video calls like I was under the impression were here. Just really unsure what the point of the AP is all together. Like is this just for messeging strangers? I don't want that at all.",
            "i updated the app last night and since then it doesn't shows the last message in some channels and groups. you can see the last message from chat list but when you open the channel it's not there. and it skips some messages in channels or groups. it also doesn't show the source channel when i forward a message to my own channel.",
            "I would give it a 5 star rating. The animation are great and the fact that I have been told that I can send file/s up to 2gb in size is great (Not done so as yet) The problem ⚠️ I am having is I receive no notification sounds. Just vibration. I have looked up and down on how to change it, but no joy😐"

Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... I like this app, but it's appears when using other apps. Otherwise, interference, unpredictable behavior and isn't stable.",
            "The app is pretty good. As it says it's fun to search and it's life too? The only issue I have is with downloads. We can't download pages like we can in chrome. Since there is no multiple tabs option there should atleast be an option where I can save some sites I wanna read later. If this is the only browser app a person uses like me then it's not so efficient. Coz I disabled chrome since it takes up a lot of space. Please do something about this. Else it's a great app. No complaints. 😄",
            "This app is great, and a great alternative to Chrome and Google. It is very easy to use and it has Google Assistant built into it when you voice search. It has a lite, incognito, and normal. It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much",
            "Excellent for many features, 1. Multiple sessions, each search in a separate window. 2. Lite mode, pages load faster and easier to read 3. More convenient search box location. 4. Opens some of the blocked sites in some countries. 5. Has bookmarks to open frequently visited pages. And more... The bad: if you left the app to another app then back, the page reloads again, very annoying when you read and compare two pages.",
            "This is a very good light browser. Very fast, always loads practically instantly even on my 4 year old s7. Very helpful side features; though I dont use them very much personally, I can see that many people would. It gives relevant search suggestions. Some features such as advanced searches are missing, but I have found that I mainly use this for finding a fact or an image quickly. Then, if I need more information, I switch to my normal browser, firefox."

        "comments": [
            "I mostly play free style but one problem is there that player there are coward, means either they left their chance of strike and wasting time by fearing that they may open the beat so opponent get advantage. Please do something player like this. Better you implement overall game time system eg. 5 mins or 10 mins per match max so that atleast time will not be wasted.",
            "A good game. However, it encourages cheating rather than sportsmanship. Why different strikers. A person looking for another person to make game for him. Sometimes if you are given the striker to start never starts. No fine and he still wins. This game favours who make purchases. Total cheating and nothing. All matches are fixed. Had suggested times and again but no hearing from your team. It seems above facts are correct. Encourages fixing and cheating. Worst game ever i played.",
            "Good to play in spare time but few of the things are not that great about the game.. 1. You need a very good internet connection. 2. Rules should have been same as Carrom. There are certain scenarios which are not counted as a foul. E.g. Directly hittting opponen's puck and not hitting any of your pucks etc. 3. Another turn should be given in case of double fine. 4. No sportamanship at all. Players can have different strickers with more abilities. 5. 2/2 matches will be great if provided.",
            "It is a awesome game I would like to give more than 5 stars but still there are some issues in it. I think there are some hackers. After the time ran out the opponent can still operate and control striker and they pot a coin this is unfair and I also tried one time but for me it is not working after the time runs out. So please notice my issue",
            "The game is very good and it is good for time pass. I loved the concept of variour strikers and powers. It has made the look of the struke phenomenal. However, like the last month the season should be carrom pass event there for each month. So, that one should get some rewards after completing each level in the carrom pass whether they have purchased it or not. That promotes the players to play this game. I hope we will receive similar kind of update soon."

            "It has always been clitchy and slow loading but it was tolreable. But, since the latest update when I place my order it says 'oops something went wrong' ! And I am unable to get to the payment page! Had this problem 6 months ago and now it has happened again !! Constant updates! Used work well....if it ain't broke don't try to fix it !!!",
            "The worst app ever to cross my phone. I don't understand how people are. Comfortable using this app when you can simple be lost while ordering 1 item, different sellers and different tabs to open and every seller has his own page and the bugs the app have with the confirmation and the Ads.. After all of this.. How Could a person accept buying an item and paying double or maybe triple the item price as a shipping fee.. I ordered 4 items with total 600p and the shipping was 549P...",
            "The app overall design and feel is just fine but their customer service is bad. I have already reported and followed up a concern multiple times about a bug (status mismatch, already delivered but still in To Receive list) in their app 3 months ago but they did not fix it until now"

            "Well, these are some ideas for this app to become better: 1. Add a chat room for the respective people in that classroom, so the communication between student-teacher is a lot easier. 2. The teachers should a notification when we turned in a homework and see how many of them we turned in. 3. You should be able to select multiple files, not only one by one. I think that's all for now, but I think I'll find more issues ASAP. Please start add more QoL.",
            "The app is great but got worse after the new updates. The to do list keep on refreshing but nothing popped up, the notification section complete got removed and this made navigating the app much more difficult. If these problems are resolved, I will change the rating. Thanks.",

The app stopped sending mobile notifications a while ago and I can't tell whenever an assignment is posted. The whole point of me downloading this app was to receive mobile notifications. Please fix this issue. Also, a dark mode would be nice.",

It just freezes and does nothing so now I can't go on websites anymore! Can you tell me what the problem is so I can fix it? If you don't have the answer, I'll be bored forever without going to any websites! 😡😡😡 I hate this app sometimes because of this problem, but it only happened there.",

Nothing is wrong with my phone or internet. Chrome app searches work 100% of the time. Google app is the issue, its been like this off and on for years, but recently has been acting up constantly.",

Now, after the recent update, it is not even showing that, its just a blank white screen and nothing else. Sometimes it's working when i try again after reopening the app. Most of the time its not. Hope you'll fix this problem ASAP.",
            "So actually, i like google since years ago. But 3 days ago or 1 week ago, i can't translate. It's maybe not like i need to update it, beacuse it only said \"UNINSTALL OPEN\". So it's probablly confusing. I don't know why i can't translate. And also, There's a lot of bugs that i can't explain. Please fix these. Thank you! By the way, I apologize for my wrong grammars or bad english.",
            "I'm honestly going to switch to another app. Google has been ok with simple searches. However with the election coming up I've been trying to search up different facts and information on Biden and Trump, only to find rather biased results. I can even look up specific dates, name, and even addresses. The results are the same, many articles on things Trump has done wrong, or praise articles on Biden. It's not because of my search relevance either, I had all of that reset. Very disappointed."

When I also understood that review your edits and use the brush for Double Exposure, I was so stoked because the only problem I had with this app was that the image does not get inside properly and when I try to darken the added image, the 1st one gets lighter and then gets beneath. Although now I have no problems.",

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

I've uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail.",

Or perhaps create a simpler way to check all settings that need apply. *Ease of access is key* It's annoying and is the reason I had to create 25 different Gmail accounts bc we don't have money to purchase any extra storage features. Please and thanks!",

I have emails sitting there waiting to be read, but I rarely get a notification of them. And I am talking about the emails in my inbox, not the ads or subscription emails. That part of gmail actually still works quite well with those being separated into separate folders. I'm looking for apps that replace all of Google's apos... might even consider (gasp!) Apple's iPhone!",

Every day I move them between primary; updates and promotions and still not one in the right place. You work on it every day but as far as I can see not one useful thing comes out of it. Oh yeah!!

Edit: I have LastPass and I've noticed this may be the only app where I can't get the password to copy over after I've pushed the autofill button for my password app. I have to manually copy and paste my password. For that reason I had to downgrade. Still a necessary app for me, and I like having it.",
            "This is a great app. Very simple, you really don't need a bank account linked to it and still use basically anywhere for anything. I would and do recommend this app to anyone trying to purchase on line, transfering/recieving money to someone, even getting paid from jobs on line I know this is the safest and fastest way to keep track of my money.",
            "I haven't used PayPal in a while, and I recall why. When the money is received it gets stuck for another 24h, sending error message with no explanation if you try to get it before. The fees are awfully high, to receive and transfer. It takes 10 DAYS to transfer the money from PayPal to you bank accounts. I do not recommend that app for money transferred",
            "Needs to support Face unlock, still unsupported as of October 2020. Update: It's not possible to log in when trying to auto fill the password as it auto closes the pop up and the password does not get to be filled in the field. Haven't seen it happen in any of my other apps, only in PayPal. I am now forced to sign in via the web version which actually works.",
            "I like the app, however, it would be nice if it would save my preferred login method, such as Fingerprint scan, because everytime I open the app, it asks me if I want to set up fingerprint scanning, which I do, but it asks every single time to set it up, even though I have it saved in my account login and security preferences. Also, this is more of a wish and not an bug/glitch it would be cool if we could pay on the PayPal mastercard balance before the statement is sent in the app. :Fixed now:"

            "I love this app. There is nothing like it! However, there is a problem. The . . ? Daily challenges arent working properly. I acheived the 20 fuel tanks & got reward. Next one, back flips. I did several back flips & only one was counted. Did it again & still, only one had been counted. Repeated the process again & same result. Hope I have helped in some way to resolve the problem. Thank you & have a great day",
            "I started playing this years ago only because my friends were playing it in high school and I remembered it being really fun. Especially just trying to beat each others highscores and trying different cars to comeplete stages. Its so nice to see that the game still has so many downloads and still has its charm as it did back then. Addictive gameplay, smooth, simple but yet beautiful graphics (looks and feels good on a bigger screen device), fun progression and also completely free to play.",
            "This is a really nice game. But the idea of havingbto start from the beginning every time is really bad. There should be lives or check points. If you die,you start where you died. You can do this maybe only twice,then from there you have to start from the beginning again. Starting over n over makes me not wanna play anymore",
            "Great app with a great features there are. So much entertainment in it it is the one of the great feature of this game. This game is good no ads in it is also a good feature in the game new cars are good and improved . That is why I love the game there are new and entertaining paths and ways I like the game very much thee are no glitches in the game ( app. ) . This is also quite funny when the man sitting in the car dies this is a great app. I have a great experience.",
            "Overall i love this game. The graphics, and ease of play is relsly good. Ive been playing it for ages and i did get really far at one point until i lost all my data before saving it. Onky problem i have with this game is the amount of time it takes to save up the coins to upgrade and unlock things."

            "Though the features of zoom is really awesome. I am unhappy to give it 4 stars due to the same video issue. Many people are facing the same problem like me I guess. When my video is on and I go to the participants list, it shows that my video is off. Even the other people cant see my video. That creates a great problem to me during online classes. Please find out a solution to solve this problem. I hope the next updates will make me rate zoom 5 starts.",
            "So yeah, I've facing this problem for 1 month or 2. First it worked good both in mobile and in laptop/computer but now, mobile is facing problem. However, there are 2 problems. 1. It lags so much when my network is excellent and it lags the other apps too. 2. When I switch tabs on my mobile during a meeting, the camera automatically gets switched off and I've been facing this problem from a month or 2. Please fix these problems and I can have a peaceful meeting.",
            "It's a nice app 🙂 it works nicely but the video camera settings is worst . Whenever I use zoom I always turn up my brightness full but this app always show my video null .So I want you to try to fix it . And then zoom is perfect for getting 5 stars. Try to fix it as soon as possible. I hope so you can do it.",
            "This is one of the worst apps. I have used this app for online classes. There are many problems during online classes. The voice of the other participants does not come through clearly in the entire meeting. This app drains the battery very fast. It takes a lot of internet to work. If the network is good even then it does not work perfectly. If I want to open my front camera and unmute myself then I am unable to do these things. The functions in this app are good but the performance is worst",
            "Worked great until for some reason my password was no longer accepted and regarded as invalid. I clicked on \"Forgot Password\" to receive an email that would let me change the password to a new one, but it sent me useless links that lead me to practically nowhere as it says, \"log in to access this page\". Seriously? I clicked \"Forgot Password\" for a reason. If I ask for a password reset, send me what I ask for and not links that lead me to practically nowhere. I missed a lot of important meetings"

            "Experience on the flipkart app has been good. It's user friendly. But 1 thing I would like to add for the development team, when we use certain set of filters and want to see any product let's say listed on number 10 and when we click on the back button, the app takes us to the starting of the page and it takes a alot of efforts and time to reach back to the desired product. This should be rectified.",
            "Best app I have ever seen.Better then Amazon and other shopping applications I am very happy with this app. I have order several times and I get every product safe and as shown in photos. This thing is good.But I only think the problem is that it take a long time in delivery. So I request decrease the delivery time and then its the perfect apk ever made and get 5 🌟 full ratings keep it up.",
            "It's an outstanding app and the best thing is that the products are really good, it appears the same as shown in the app. All products are of good price. I have been using Flipkart from an interval and I am very satisfied with it. And customer care services are really good, they give a very good response, they understand and they accept the issue. It's a beautiful shopping app. Love you Flipkart",
            "App is superb, the filtering works much better than amazon (as there are more parameters). Just a few hiccups: 1. Ocassionally notification bell icon would show a large number of notifications, but when I click on them, there are none. 2. Flipkart original videos cannot be played:( 3. There should be an easier way to switch among multiple user accounts like Amazon allows.",
            "FLIPKART = A Beautiful Neatly Arranged App. Vibrant Blue Color, Bold Text. Neatly Organized Categories. Millions Of Products Available. Real Product Photos, Specifications, Dimensions. Easy To Understand. Language Options Are Available. Bold & Clear Notification. All Payment Methods Are Allowed. Easy Cancellations, Exchanges, Returns & Refunds. Friendly Customer Service. I Love Flipkart."

Again, I enjoy this app but l'm just tired of looking for ways to answer clearly and that the questionaire with understand it more because of the problem. Thank you for this application",
            "This app is amazing. From the time that I had downloaded it , I cannot stop using it . It has provided me all the answers that I have ever searched (even maths with proper explanation) . You might not get ur answer some times so u can post a question and get an answer from other users. So you should definitely try this app. It will really help you alot🏆📖📚📑🎒",
            "The old version was very useful. But this one is not user friendly. Audio questions are only in hindi, if i ask in english it started to type in Hindi . And also the scan and solve option is also not working correctly, if i ask a question, it is diverting to other questions. The old version was very useful. I don't know what is happening in the new version.",
            "The app is awesome. The problem is with the latest version of android. There is a bug. Eveytime i work with formula tab, the app crashes. Also you can make improvements towards making inserting formulas much more easily and conveniently. The idea of app is good . I myself contributed answers. Please fix this issue as soon as possible in next update at earliest.",
            "This is a really great app! Ever since my modules came, I had trouble answering them. When I searched on Google for one of my questions, I found this app. I downloaded it and it is amazing! Random people started answering my questions, not only have I got my answers, but new friends as well. I hope this app wouldn't have any problems in the future. Thanks!"

            "I have to go through the level finishing right at the start. Is this a joke to you? Whenever you hold to try and make the ball go down, you can only get to about 5 or 6 lines and then it just stops and tells you the level is completed. Please fix this. Incredible amounts of lag due to loading Advertisement and overall rubbish. This could do with less advertisement, more bug fixing and communicating. I think this app is lazy and unfinished so this is why I put 1 star. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!",
            "I give 4 star because I love this game sooooo much but there is one problem there is soo much ads, When I just Start play the ad will come. But whatever I just love this game!!! 💕",
            "This game is very easy and fun to play! I love this app I can never get off it. It's sooo amazing I can get different collective items every day and they look amazing! My favorite one is the bomb because it's super deadly in different ways. If you don't like this game then you are totally boring because this game is super fun! So if I were you I would go on play store, DOWNLOAD the app and give it 5 stars.",
            "I don't think so. I could take an ad after three or four levels, but after 2 is ridiculous. Plus, the game cheats. You are not touching the ad at all, you're just sitting there waiting for the \"X\" out, and before you can \"X\" out the app OPENS Google Play. That sucks and it's dishonest. I did not want to go to Google Play.",
            "Decent game, tend to enjoy it when I need to kill time. Only problem is the ads. The levels are long enough to not feel constantly bombarded by ads, and this game runs well if you disconnect from WiFi. In this game you can continue from where you lost if you watch a video. But if you say you don't want to continue, it will often play an ad anyway and not give you anything in return? Why play an ad if I just hit a button to not watch an ad and restart the level?"

            "OM used to be the go to web browser for low end phones. It made my Nokia 3110c a smartphone, it made my Sony Ericsson W200i a smartphone, it made my Samsung Corby II a smartphone. Today I use a low end Android phone with Android 8.1 Go edition. Unfortunately I don't get the reliable experience I got from the above mentioned phones. I think OM is trying to fix something that is not broken and got everything messed up in the process. I would like to have the old reliable OM back. Thank you",
            "I found it better than chrome. I was using chrome before but recently when you browse for list of movies in chrome their new format is very inconvenient. Also when I start to download a file chrome don't show any download progress, in fact it doesn't even show if the file is being downloaded or not. Very frustrating. So I went on to play store in search of another browser and stumbled upon opera browser. Downloaded it and what do you know, first time lucky. Love it.",
            "The app is good but it usually gives me many inconveniences for instance it offers free browsing but yet whenever I try it,it doesn't work. I must have data before mine works.please help fix it,,am so disappointed right now!!",

This app definitely deserves more hype. Does not take as much storage as other apps and, whenever you click a pic or take a video, it saves it directly to your gallery, so you don't have to export it. I am very satisfied. Would recommend this app!",
            "B612 is really an awesome app for filters, photos, video shoots, and everything.... it has the best filters.... It is not less than \"tiktok\"... I like shooting videos but no posting... so I just shoot them on B612, with the awesome filters and music... the only think that must be improved is that the music search must be there..... And everything is really awesome... 😍😍",
            "Full support excellent application for photos and videos. A Minor thing I downloaded all the stuff in this app like effects,stickers,make ups and what not everything went good until last update. I updated B612 and guess what everything I had downloaded was gone and has to be downloaded again.And sometimes when I open the app it presents me with a blank screen and I have to restart.One more thing there are bugs and several options which wouldnt work.Like the hair colour changer for instance.",
            "I am very happy after using this app but i have rated it 4 stars cuz i got one problem. I do some editings with this app. It would have been better if there was video merging option and text writing in videos. I will rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed in the next update.",
            "Plz add separate slides for makeup..means it must be separate for lipsticks,highlight your face,blush on...when I want to highlight only MN face ,to look natural,dark coloured lipstick has been applied which is so so irritating.please consider that...if we want to only highlight face but don't want any lipstick,than what will we do?

I tried everything. But with a broken screen, there was just no way for me to back up my phone or retrieve my contacts from my phone.",
            "I love using this app for contact back up only thing is I just got a new phone and added a new contact to device. The app didn't back it up automatically so I had to add it manually. When I assigned a number to speed dial my phone shows multiple numbers for the same person. Most of which were the samw number. I'd love for the app to tell me if there are miultiple numbers for contacts on my phone and have the app merge the contacts on my phone.",
            "I've been using Google Contacts on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra. Contacts just disappear! Where are they going? This problem Google, has been ongoing now for awhile. The same with Google Mesaages. Problems with messages not sending unless you go into Messages to turn Chat off. What the heck?? Who is ruining these Google Apps?? My Pixelbook with Google Contacts as defult, the same contact as on my Samsung, just disappears...",
            "Syncing works fine for me. However I'm annoyed that I can't view a contact's details beyond name and photo without using the \"edit\" function. I can't be the only person out there who occasionally needs to look at a contact's mailing address. To do this from the contact detail screen you must use the \"edit\" button. So weird.",
            "It is OK ish, with basic functions available to phones for years missing. Speed dial contacts on home screen. Once a norm, now hard to find. Google contacts will give option to add a contact to home screen, but it omits the option to make it a speed / direct dial action. It only opens that contact in the app... The whole point of sending a contact to home page is for this reason, to be able to directly dial key contacts. Please implement this feature. Now that google contacts for various reasons are becoming the default app, instead of an option, with native contact apps missing (like in recent Xiaomi phones which did have this feature) there is even more urge to add this functionality"

Today I found some sort of glitch that some of the games I played, it said that they were played 1st January 1970 for some reason AND NO MATTER WHAT I DID IT STAYED LIKE THAT!!!! I found it absolutely ANNOYING and I need you to know about it and fix it, GOOGLE!!!!! >:(|",

Please fix this problems, also I'm finding bugs in the app.",

But now in this update you can play MORE different games, ADD friends, EARN achievements ( that was old lol) but still. Look how much it offers you! It's incredible, It's one of the apps that you can actually never get bored of. Good job developers, I'm more than surprised!! :))",

Now some of the games I've played lost all the progress I made in them because my profile no longer exists even though I never deleted it and its under the same Gmail. It wants me to create a new one and doesn't offer a way to try and recover my original one. Typically would care but I invested a lot of time and a little money in marvels contest of champions and now its all gone."

            "This app is better than any other calculator app. I've never had issues with this app. Its big buttons and visual makes it easy on the eyes and fun, doesn't glitch, and it does exactly what I need it to do with no bells and whistles. Though as of today 10/08/2020 I went to use it to work on some things and noticed it has mysteriously uninstalled itself. But guess what - I installed it RIGHT back lol😄.",
            "Try to make the UI simple instead of going here and there or copy the MI calculator app.Try to provide the calculation history in the entry field itself. So we can easily check the correctness of the calculation without going to the history window. Also while using scientific calculator I have to rotate the mobile. It is annoying and it is very difficult in field condition.",
            "Samsung this is a request to please make more user friendly ui of calculator app. To open the trigonometric and other functions, we need to rotate the mobile. Just a suggestion that it would be great if there can be a slide(swap from right to left) feature which can open those functions in portrait mode only. Thanks n regards",
            "It's a very good app, it calculate very accurately, it's very easy to use( just press the numbers like the real calculator and then press = to get your results) or tilt your phone to go to crazy super nerdy mode. Thank you Samsung for making calculations so easy.",
            "There is no innovation in this app, I could not see and user friendly approach here. I expect real time innovative and creative approach from Samsung. Greetings !"

            "The overall system/hub is great. However, this app is slow and clunky. Classic was better. It takes some time to load everything on launch before I can do anything. Then, when you go into a device, there's only a tiny space on the sides to scroll. Otherwise, if you scroll in the middle fast, it won't scroll, gotta go slow and it looks like it wants to select an option. You simply cannot scroll past a color wheel for a light because you'll just be selecting a color instead of scrolling. Annoying.",
            "Could use a little work. Looks are better than the features. I wish for the oven connection, I didn't have to start while right in front of it and rather be able to at least start keep warm to get the oven started. Also that you have to stop oven to change which to a different setting then have to be once more right in front of oven to begin the new setting. I do understand it for security, but I think there should be a way to also disable temp for more secure homes.",
            "If anyone else in your home uses the app to do something on the tv it basically makes your app unusable for the rest of the day. My wife used it and I try to use it a few minutes later to change the settings on my tv and I'm stuck in an infinite sign in loop. It's stupid. Why even add a feature to add other accounts to the group if only one can even navigate the app at a time?",
            "Edit: Still not compatible with Android 11. I've been paying monthly for my smart Tracker service that I'm not able to use. This is unacceptable from such a large company. Not compatible with Android 11 can use my tracker anymore. Reached out to support and they told me an official version of Android is not supported... Reached out to support again and they said android 11 isn't supported because it's in beta. It hasn't been in beta for almost a month now and I can't use my smart Tracker.",
            "The app says we have to download an add on. I press download and it says we can't download it, contact us. I contacted several times and didn't get any feedback. Well done guys. Even when it works, the touchpad works only once !!! After that you have to restart the app to use the touchpad But, someone's you can't even stop the app."

Your advertising system is cheating you, theu show your ads to the same people over and over again. No new people at all.",
            "I really like this game, but at level 25, there is no warning, difficulty does not increase, they just stop giving you goals to proceed, and the game is over. You can harvest all day, but you're not progressing any more. Also, the ad with the big long harvest blade is false advertising, you never see it. It was a fun game, but sadly lacking in the end.",
            "This is disturbingly addicting. I cant stop playing for some reason. I do have a slight issue with the controls, though. Sometimes it feels too sensitive, and sometimes it seems to turn in the opposite direction of where it want it to go. Also, time extension bonuses would be a wonderful addition. I feel bummed out when I'm so close to getting a personal goal, but im cut short by a few seconds.",
            "I love this game but it froze up. This is the second time. I had to delete it and reload the game. I,m not doing it again. No other game has done ever this! You get to level 25 and I guess thats it!! GAME Same old same old from then on. Done it, good bye, hope they expand it was fun.",
            "This game is SOOOO MUCH FUN. Its not got that many ads as others are saying it has. Its a good way to pass time but my only problem is sometimes when time is over it asks me if i want 2x more than i earned and i pressed \" no thanks \" but it still gave me an unskippable add. This has only happened 2 or 3 times so it doesnt ruin the overall game. Still 5 stars🤗"

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

I wish it had mod(), matrix, string handling [e.g. to find digits n thru n+k], and could deal with tables of inputs -> outputs, with a lookup fcn. Then, with 128 Gb sd-card, or cloud storage, it would be unstoppable!",
            "I kinda wish this app was more like Microsoft's calculator since, even though I love the simplicity of this calculator bit it I don't want to be downloading other apps to have a scientific calculator, or a calculator for volume or whatever it is, basically saying that this should have more features than it just being super simple.",
            "It works, bit I find so much is pointless to a basic user, I don't need scientific mode on 100% of the time, and I'd like M+/- buttons instead of having to mess with copy and paste. Give us a basic and scientific button to toggle between the modes.. PS to the people complaining about the clear, press and hold the backspace button and it will clear",
            "OK, but a waste of memory since I have to download another calc app for converting F°/C°, gal/litr and ft/mm etc. Samsung has that inbuilt. So there's is better. I don't use the scientific operations, so looking at them all the time is visual clutter. VERY ugly app. Lastly, in all that clutter you can't give us a memory +/recall key OR a simple clear/all clear key. You know, keys that are found in just about EVERY calculator anyone has ever used EVER. /smh",
            "It's a very good app !!! It's very useful. One of the best calculator ! We have dark theme and light theme. But I have given 4 stars because I want that we can have more colours and we can add our own picture theme. Please add this feature. 🙂"

If anyone knows the solution for this, then do let us know ASAP! Guys",

            "Wrong time estimation... Undoubtedly its a very easy way to transfer data but the time estimated by the app is a big problem... Its saying 10 min but taking more than an hour.. It would be appreciable if instead of time it shows data percentage or the amount of bytes transferred..",

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",

The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

            "After the last update, I'm not able to connect to my samsung account. I cannot check for the new items and install them. I don't know what kind of dumb software you run. It's not connecting to my Samsung account. It just keeps on spinning and then say network issue. Get some good developers who can make this app work. Total waste of money.. Not even serious to even look to the review. Well done samsung",
            "Hard to use. Unclear on what some of the applications mean. Not very good graphics. Added 1 star because after using it for a few months, I now realize the great features that it has. Such as listening to music without my phone 😍❤. Adding my pictures from my gallery. The more I use it the better it becomes. October 14, 2020 brings new challenges with this watch. I charged it last night & in the morning after a few hours, it's completely dead. Can't do my morning workout 😫. Taking away 1 star.",
            "Connection problems! Once disconnects, you cannot reconnect it again unless you restore it and lose some data. This happened only recently with the last update. Please fix it! So disappointing... I have unistalled everything and re-installed them back. Everything was switched off and on. Did all the tricks. Nothing works.",
            "Love how small but complete the watch is. Battery life is good. Swim results need some work but it does a good job detecting strokes. It doesnt record kicking or drills. Cant wait to use it for running and weight training! I loved the Gear FitPro and was not looking to spend 500 dollars for a watch that does the same as this one, worth the buy. Only gripe is the music app cant import YouTube music or spotify. That needs to be fixed on the phone Samsung music app sucks.",
            "Battery drain!! YES, THIS WEAR APP IS TO BLAME. The watch is fine in airplane mode, or with Bluetooth on and the Wear app disabled. It's not the watch itself. Enabling the app and allowing it to connect drains the watch battery so fast it is useless. Samsung doesn't know, or actually doesn't care. A couple versions ago this wasn't happening."

        "comments": [
            "i love the idea of call screening and the transcriptions are useful but the blocking engine is too basic and not really effective. It allows incoming calls that spoof the first six digits of my number to ring my phone. It also lets through incoming calls for which the screening transcription contains the words \"ssn\" and \"fraudulent transaction\". Come on, guys. Time to step it up.",
            "I don't know what is wrong with this app everytime I answer the call my phone screen goes all blank. I can't talk to anyone putting the phone in speaker. It's happening since past 1 month. My cell phone is working just fine but this app is creating a problem. Fix the bug please. I'm still not getting this app. After doing clear cache its still not working. Screen goes all blank",
            "Basic functionality doesn't work. Line is busy and then I end the call and it won't stop beeping with the line is busy sound. Doesn't matter if I quit the app. Only restarting the phone fixes it. Loved this app when I had a pixel phone and was happy to see it available to download with my LG V50 but unfortunately I'm going to have to uninstall this app and use the stock app until it's fixed.",
            "So far so good... Except for a minor issue: i usually register my contacts with the country code associated to their number. However, when I receive calls from them they are not recognize as my contacts, and instead their number is displayed WITHOUT their number's country code. I didn't have this issue with the Samsung default Phone app.",
            "All of a sudden the \"voicemail\" option has stopped. When I get a call the voicemail does not register the call. I have to call my phone number to see if I have any messages. I called google fi twice and neither can help me fix the problem. I have to now wait for a supervisor to send me an email! While I am stuck not receiving any voicemails messages!!

Horribly complex UI for doing simple stuff. 3. Just look at examples of data usage in Airtel app versus MyJio app and decide which one is clear, concise and which one is just plain rubbish.",
            "Very Bad Experience, I went to the page to recharge my account, but every time the page is loaded a message popped up saying \"You cannot proceed due to low account balance. Please recharge your account.\",and page needed to reload again, please tell me how am I supposed to recharge my account if the pop-up keep disturbing me in the process. 😡😡😡🤬🤬",
            "Doesn't update the data usage for dozens of hours. It's been 2 days since i have been using the mobile data as broadband service is down. N i have used it for streaming videos n it hasn't updated the usage in 2 days. It shows the updated number sometimes if you hit refresh but that's very rare less than 1in 20. Usually it would just show the old numbers even after hitting refresh. Also restarting the app doesn't change anything either. Disappointing service overall.",
            "I am writing this review regarding Airtel network in my area My network gets frequently disconnected completely for 5-10 seconds and then reconnect. If you are in a meeting or game you will be disconnected for a period of 10-20 seconds minimum. Totally disappointed with these kind of frequent fluctuations. Not sure about other areas.",
            "There is no option to talk with any official in the app. I did so many attempts on 121 and 198 regarding my bill. There is only limited options and hence we need to talk with official in person. But unfortunately I cannot get it. Airtel Thanks is not useful in this way. Pl give me number or show me how I can approach with your official to talk something which does not cover under this app. Thank you."

            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

            "This app works great. But after each update it gets messed up for a short while. The last time you gutpys updated two of my cameras stopped working on the app. but after two weeks or so they started working again. But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

            "The old version is the best version of this app. This current model is a huge disappointment and it is consistent of being worst overtime. It focus more on nonsense stuff than the actual objective of this app. Plus, ads are so annoying. If it just stay on what it is designed to be back then, then it would be superb. Not recommended. 👎",
            "This app has been useful and I have been using it for 2 years, I think I have used it for too long that it doesn't work to some users anymore, it doesn't work anymore for me, my brother wanted for me to install Minecraft but he has so we instead tried to share it, it doesn't work, we tried it 12 times already, it kept saying \"receiver not found\" even we are on the same version of this app, it could have been a bug or other stuffs, but pls fix it!",
            "This app used to be great once upon a time. I've been using SHAREit since 2013, but it has just been getting worse over time. Now it's flooded with advertisements and unwanted stuffs. Even the main home page layout has been reduced drastically to make room for more advertisements. But the core feature of the app hasn’t improved at all. Extremely disappointed. Not recommended. There are much better alternatives available.",
            "When I first used this app it was so great and fast and I really love it. But now I higly recommend to stop using it because it has so many adds when you open the app, there are so many permisions requested unlike before and it has many unnecessary things added that should be not added. Every time they update, only the feature is upgraded and they forgot that the use of share it is to transfer fast and this is what the users expect, they should not put some unnecesary things.",
            "Now I really have to give it three stars. The ads are annoying me. The send and receive bottons are small. If I receive any app or game from another Mobile it doesn't install says base. And every time you give the same update. So can do something so it becomes popular like before. Please do something or I have to this app give it one star and install another app. I really love this sharing app. I am using it 2 years. But now I think this app has become an online video showing app. Thank you."

They all are skippable after 5 or 10 seconds. After watching every add we can cancel it by pressing × symbol which will be at corners. In cricbuzz the same was there. But when i click that it opens that advertisement's website and then playstore. I cannot come back to use cricbuzz. I had to close the app and again visiting cricbuzz.",

            "Have used this app successfully for several years on multiple devices. However, it has now stopped working completely following an upgrade to Android 10 - as other reviewers have reported. App appears to install correctly and allows you to lock individual apps so they require PIN/ pattern to run them. Once you've configured the app, it simply doesn't work - you can open any app on the phone without your PIN. I've tried a uninstall/ reinstall but that didn't work either. Uninstalled permanently and replaced with rival app.",
            "Kudos to AppLock Developers, I have been using the app for over 5years and currently on my Android 10 and it's doing just fine. People that complain it doesn't work needs to confirm if in their memory (RAM) cleaning, the app is white listed and also allow the app complete access to the phone e.g access to modify files, access to camera, access to notifications etc. The only problem I encountered is the phone cleaner within the app it's cleans important files, Thanks",
            "Keeps saying my SD storage is full but all the files I try and add into the vault are in the SD card that still has 98GB worth of free data. Looking at it again it drags it off my SD card and into my internal storage clogging up my phone. Uninstalling the app keeps all those files locked up forcing me to reinstall the app after I delete one of my other apps. Too much of a pain in the ass to work with to be installed.",
            "Apparently no longer get any support. and I have been a VIP also known as premium subscriber for several years. Have been trying for weeks now to get support at the listed email site. The app will not recognize that I am a paid member and all my configurations disappeared when the app updated itself. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to see if I could get my configured settings back. All I get by email is just an automated response to check the FAQ.",
            "I've been using this app for more than 5 years now and it's exceptional. But I just downloaded it now on my newly bought phone (Redmi Note 9S Global) and it's no longer working in terms of locking system apps (Gallery, Photos, File Manager, Messenger, etc). I locked those apps to require a password everytime it will be opened, but sad to say it's opening right away even if I set it to be locked. It sucks to say that this app now sucks big time. Please fix it ASAP."

            "I really love this app it keeps me on track and on time. As the old saying goes better sleep means better work. I can use this app as a visual silent alarm. I also use it with my boys so they know when it's time to do their homework or to take a shower and get ready for bedtime. Great Job on developing this app. 👍",
            "Would rate 0 stars if i could. Worked just fine first couple weeks, absolutely loved it for the greyscale and DnD activation at night while charging. Made it easier to get to sleep. But now its not turning off in the morning and I'm missing important alarms and getting up late because of it! If I set it to turn off at a certain time so my alarms can go off, I expect it to turn off! Went from loving this to hating it literally overnight.",
            "At 5:30 a.m., while I was still sleeping, I was awoken by an audible notification (even though my default sound is set to silent) from this app, to tell me the app could help better manage my sleep. Waking me up from sleep with not enough time to fall back asleep before my kids wake up is NOT HELPFUL.",
            "It was good at beginning but as i noticed trends. Since the time google has allowed other companies give digital wellbeing it has got worse on Google devices. I am using Pixel 3xl and its Always showing wrong data. Apps which i didn't even open show time of 30-40m. Underpins the whole task of tracking activity and has lost its foundation as an app. Useless app right now.",
            "It would be nice if the app was easier to acquire (lots of phones are not supported by it, a large part of them probably never will). It should be built into every Android 9+ version. Other than that, the app helped me reduce my usage of some social media apps drastically - no more scrolling for half an hour!"

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

I installed and today I am playing 109 level the game is awesome I am saying true",

            "Such a shame, could have been a really cool puzzle game, but there's just far too many ads.. It's literally ridiculous.. I get that you guys have got to make money.. But forced adverts after almost every completed level, plus a banner at the bottom. Is just pure overkill and greed. I played about 6 or 7 levels and just gave up.",
            "I don't normally review games based on their ad count because devs need revenue, but this one needs it to be considered. The game is simple, which is exactly what I signed up for, but a simple game combined with an ad after every 2 second puzzle is just frustrating and discouraging. It feels like a cash grab. The game itself, while incredibly easy, is alright. I was looking for a good stimulating timewaster, and I ended up with an ad exhibition with breaks sometimes. No thank you, I'm deleting.",
            "It's fun, but the ads are ridiculous. You take 5 seconds to beat a level, then have to watch a 30-60 second ad. There should ALWAYS be more gameplay than ads, NOT the other way around! Also, it's very obvious that some patterns get reused over and over, either that or, after a certain number of levels, they start over from level 1.",
            "The idea of this game is pretty cool but the puzzles are really easy and sometimes they repeat. There are ads after each puzzle, if you're really lucky, sometimes you get 2 before an ad. The good thing is that they made the ads skippable but they're still just as annoying, especially because the puzzles only take seconds to complete. If you can handle the ads then this is a good time waster but if you're looking for something stimulating then keep looking cuz they dropped the ball on this one.",
            "A fun enough expirence because ot was free. I personally disconnect from wifi because I read from other reviews that there were too many ads. But I was able to cycle through all of the levels in under 15 minutes. And they REALLY aren't very hard. I know these games are probably meant to pull in children but I'm a 20 year old man and this really didn't cut it for me :/ didn't have glitches or anything but still a sad expirence. It never really elevates in difficulty."

But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",

This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

Kindly do needful, if can.",

But sometimes after putting the SD Card again, it doesn't allow me to move, rename and do anything to the SD Card. It says permission required. Not to mention that it is full of ads and some are even inappropriate for teenagers like me. I can see a lot of people complaining about this but you're not even responding to us and not doing something to it.",

Files are neatly shown: if one has 200 times for example \"file.txt\" in various paths so which one is which? what is the path? where is it? As far as I know showing a path somehow like using a smaller font is not patented. Does not understand symbolic links. Android/data is empty while it is not.",

Look for the APK of the Google Recorder and sideload and use that instead.",

            "Love the fact I can download most videos on a page but if it wasn't for that I'd delete the app because I detest seeing the news feed on the homepage and cannot disable it or personalize it. I'll give the 5 star rating if you fix the news feed back to where it can be completely disabled or the news sites used can be deleted individually. Bad choice using Taboola for your news feed. *UPDATE* So glad you fixed the app so I can disable the news feed. 5 ⭐ rating now. Thank you!",
            "Good app. However, it doesn't allow gesture comtrols when watching videos in full screen. I want to be able to swipe on the screen and control the volume and brightness of the video. Also, when exiting the app it asks you to clear history which I like. However, when you select \"don't remind me again\" it actually does not clear history the next time you exit. This I assume is some bug that hasn't been taken care of the last few months. I will give 5 stars if both these features are fixed.",
            "Thank you very much for fixing the glitch on Youtube. I greatly appreciate the Phoenix browser team for addressing and solving the glitch issue.(the youtube video plays like a horror movie) Prior to the upgrade, I could play youtube on the background by putting the youtube website on desktop mode, now I am not able to do that. I would greatly appreciate if that feature would be put back on. I really appreciate the upgrades that the Phoenix browser did! Thank you.",
            "It's a great app overall. I would rate it five stars if it opens links on new tabs. I don't know if it's my ignorance or the app is designed like that. Whenever i search on google , and long press a page to open in new tab . It does not show open in new tab or open in background etc. All it displays is copy link and block ads etc.please help . It's annoying.",
            "The previous two versions are the most useless versions of this app ive ever used. The app will take you to all these annoying ads pages with every click, every click. To click on anything on the page might take up to a minute before it finally opens, cos every click takes you to another page for ads, and also for every page you open, it takes you to playstore to download this IQ testing app. Its just shambolic, very shambolic"

If I saw an option to pay for no ads version I would pay. Maybe you have it but it's not visible nor incentive. Good game, good idea, but the experience is awful.",
            "WARNING: This game is a bombardment of ads. This game would be okay if it was not for the massive amount of ads bombardment you are faced with. I honestly understand you need ad revenue to make money however when you spend twice as more time watching ads versus actually playing the game then it becomes too much. On top on all of this, the game is way too simple and poses no challenge what-so-ever. The goal of this game is for you to finish the level as soon as possible so another ad can load.",

Therefore I will never install this game (or anything from this app maker) and I am uninstalling the game that brought me here. Hitting the x in an ad should never take me to the play store. That just shows how greedy the app designers are. It's been my experience that greedy designers don't give good customer service.",

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I have no problem with this game. Others say it has about 50 million ads every day, with a 3 star rating or under. The only thing I dislike, are the glitches. But that one problem isn't going to put me off this game for life like it will with all the other whimps out there. I have had tonns of apps and games with ads, but the only reason I felt like deleting them is to download other more fun and popular games I see thanks to the games with lots of ads. So, ads aren't really that bad after all.",
            "Nice casual game. When I have nothing to do i simply open it and it entertains me. But man by every update they are increasing the difficulty. So i want to tell the developers that this game has an image of refreshing and casual game. So the more difficulties you add the more people will not play it. So better for you guys, Make it more entertaining not difficult.",
            "This is such a relaxing game! The ads aren't so bad, cause well, which game doesn't have ads? The only issue I have with the game is that the sounds play whenever the media volume is raised, and they don't stop despite muting them in the settings bar. That's really annoying tbh, and the only reason why I wouldnt give this 5 stars",
            "It is an amazing and addictive game. Really easy to use and child friendly. There are games in which their ads show that the game is like this and this how to use it but then it is different to use.In this game, it shows the true usage of this and the ad is true. This is the most favourite of all time.😘😘😍😍",
            "Ads are one thing, but what they do is after you finish a level, they will offer you a free upgrade if you watch an ad within 10 seconds of clicking it. But even when you decline it, when you try to manually upgrade your character, you are given a free upgrade and you can ONLY upgrade if you FORCEFULLY watch an ad. Get that trash out of your apps you plugs."

They dont make games for the players they make games for the ads. -10/100",
