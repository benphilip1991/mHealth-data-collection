            "Pretty neat little app ya got here! My gf didn't believe me when I told her there is a vein viewer app, but lo and behold, I won that bet! It does *kinda* work! Basically its fun to play with for about 5 mins, but NO ONE should be using this on actual patients, or in a hospital setting, in ANY capacity! IT IS NOT A LEGIT MEDICAL DEVICE! But, check it out, its actually kinda neat! It would be useful if there was a menu button with the different options and a brief explanation of the functions!",
            "Looking around for a vein finder is like looking for a Night vision app on the app store. Most of them are fake and just change filter on your camera. I'm assuming this is doing the same thing but it's being done in a different way. The light comes on which helps show the veins in slightly better light (even if you can't see it) then the camera adds a filter that makes it appear IR which picks up on subtle changes (your now slightly darker veins) If you guys make it clearer I'll give 5⭐",
            "New phone, well new as in same model(S10), but broke my last one. Wish I still had that old one, because thats when this app worked best. Now inside looking into the screen of a 1988 atari video game. 1 star bc i had to give it something for trying...i guess.",
            "Thanks. Helped alot to find a ripe vein to intravenously injest certain vitamins and essential things to keep me zoom zoom zooming all day.. barley a blown vein or collapsed one since I've downloaded this app. Use to atleast once a week. I make sure to tell all my friends. Even ones that have never used by IV and now do because of this app! THANKS! SPEED BE WITH YOU!",

            "This does not resolve UV/IR, it is simply a visible colour filter as the app name suggests. To verify this do the following:1. check your camera can detect IR by using your TV remote control and your normal camera app. 2. Using this app with IR setting point camera at a warm object of any colour except red on a cooler red background and note that the background is lighter than the warmer object. 3. if you have time on your hands point the camera at a kettle and turn it on - your kettle won't change colour and neither will your image, despite the IR getting more and more intense. Just a fun app like the \"lie detectors\" but well made. In order to use your camera to image IR you need a physical filter to block the visible spectrum, you cannot resolve IR in the sensor output after the sensor has turned it into a false white.",

Varicose veins develop most often in the legs, but also on the thighs.\r\nThe varicose veins of the lower limbs correspond to abnormal dilations of veins located on the surface of the lower limbs. They are frequently found in the disease called chronic venous insufficiency and may be due to several mechanisms. The blood flows from the small veins on the level of the feet, towards the larger veins, going up towards the heart. In normal functioning, this is made possible by three mechanisms: the pressure generated by the contraction of the heart, the contraction of the muscles, especially when walking which allows an additional impulse in this direction, and the existence of small valves, located on the path of the superficial veins, which prevent the blood from descending. If there is a problem with these valves or there is an obstacle to the progression of the blood, venous insufficiency appears. This causes an accumulation of blood in the most affected veins and the appearance of varicose veins. Some factors increase the risk of developing lower extremity varicose veins, including: heat, sedentary lifestyle, pregnancy, prolonged standing and poor circulation.\r\nTreatments for varicose veins vary according to the intensity of the manifestations and the degree of venous insufficiency.

It should not replace clinical judgement.

            "I really like this app and have been using it for 5 years. It's worked perfect with the INR log, dosage amounts, daily reminder, and doctors appt reminder. All are great!! However, recently upgraded my Android phone and the daily reminder to take my meds doesn't work. Very disappointing!!! I wish it still worked as it did on my old Android. Otherwise, I would totally recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful app. It does everything is needed to carry on with the anticoagulant therapy. Better than other similar Android free apps. I only rated 4 stars because the \"export to csv\" function doesn't work on my Huawei P Smart.",
            "Great App but there's a few things. We need a way to back up our info in case of failure, or phone changes. We also need a way to delete and edit our inr logs once they are entered. If i make a mistake i have to delete the app and start over. That's annoying as heck! Also allow us to write in dates rather than scrolling.",
            "I have a home INR meter. While I had a INR diary I had no way to generate reports. I like 😍 being able to get reports.",
            "I really like how convenient this app is. I love the options of dosages, as being on Warfarin/Coumadin as they can change frequently depending on how strict you are with your diet. I know how diabetics must feel having to manage something without as little error as possible. I can't seem to find any other app like this so it obviously is in my honest opinion a great resource to log your dosage. I hope you all stay happy and healthy! Much love! <3<3<3 Isolated Anomaly"

Would help if you could add drip calcs for drugs that are done mcg/kg/min...like dopamine, lidocaine, nitro, epi, etc. It would be especially useful if you could plug in the drug concentration being use, the bag volume, gtts, and pt weight.",
            "It's great, works really nicely, it has all the medical scoring algorithms you would need, perfect thing to have as an app. Beware the US units which are default - they can be changed to European units easily, but you need to remember to press the convert button.",

            "Has pretty much everything I need. Only thing is sometimes there's more than one calculator for a score and it's not clear which one to use. Example is Well's criteria for DVT / PE."

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nAnal itching\r\nOne or more hard, tender lumps near your anus\r\nAnal ache or pain, especially when sitting\r\nToo much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.\r\n\r\nInternal Hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nBleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement\r\n\r\n\r\n========\r\nSymptoms\r\n========\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:\r\n\r\n1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,\r\n2) Anal itching,\r\n3) Pain in the anal area,\r\n4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nThese include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nWith internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by \"regular skin\" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

        "description": "A varicose vein is a condition in which the vein becomes swollen. The surface of the skin becomes purplish or bluish in color. This condition may cause pain and discomfort to the person. Varicose veins occur when the valve of the vein becomes ineffective. The valve of the vein that regulates the flow of the blood becomes ineffective.\r\n\r\nThere are several remedies available to prevent varicose veins. Natural treatments for this condition are very common and effective.\r\n\r\nThe following home remedies can be used for the treatment of this condition.\r\n\r\nAvoid tight clothes:\r\n\r\nTight garments will keep the blood accumulated in your legs. Do not wear tight undergarments or clothes. Avoid wearing tight stockings as veins in the legs can be easily affected.\r\n\r\nAvoid standing and sitting for a long period of time:\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this is to keep the blood circulation normal. Even when you are in a laying position, keep a pillow under your legs, so that the blood drains to all body parts easily.\r\n\r\nExercise:\r\n\r\nDo regular exercises, such as jogging, biking and walking to prevent varicose veins. This will also keep you healthy and fit.\r\n\r\nWear support hose:\r\n\r\nThis will help in reducing the pool of blood in small vessels present close to the skin. This will also help in draining the blood into the large veins from where it can go back to the heart.\r\n\r\nDietary changes:\r\n\r\nIncreasing the fiber intake may help in preventing varicose veins. Vitamin C and bioflavonoids should also be consumed daily in this condition, as they help to restore the blood flow and act as anti-inflammatory agent. You should consult your nutritionist for proper nutrition plans.\r\n\r\nZinc rich diets are also useful in promoting healthy veins. You can also use zinc supplements for this purpose\r\n\r\nThe combination supplements of gotu kola and ginkgo biloba are also helpful in reducing the formation of varicose vein.\r\n\r\nCastor Oil:\r\n\r\nIt is a very popular Ayurveda medicine for the treatment of this condition. It is very easy to use. Take a piece of flannel cloth and soak it in castor oil. Now, place this soaked cloth on the affected area and let it remain there for about 20-30 minutes.\r\n\r\nHorse Chestnut:\r\n\r\nIt contains aescin that helps in relieving leg cramps. It also helps in reducing cellulite. The combination of witch hazel leaves and chestnut is also a useful remedy for varicose veins.",

        "description": "Is a Doppler the same as an ultrasound?\r\n\r\nWhat is Doppler test in pregnancy?\r\n\r\nHow long does it take to get results from a Doppler test?\r\n\r\nWhat is a Doppler test for DVT?\r\n\r\nWhat is a Doppler ultrasound?\r\nA Doppler ultrasound is a test that uses high-frequency sound waves to measure the amount of blood flow through your arteries and veins, usually those that supply blood to your arms and legs.\r\n\r\nVascular flow studies, also known as blood flow studies, can detect abnormal flow within an artery or blood vessel. This can help to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including blood clots and poor circulation. A Doppler ultrasound can be used as part of a blood flow study.\r\n\r\nA Doppler ultrasound is a risk-free and pain-free procedure that requires little preparation. The test provides your doctor with important information about the flow of blood through your major arteries and veins. It can also reveal blocked or reduced blood flow through narrowed areas in the arteries, which could eventually lead to a stroke.\r\n\r\nWhy do I need a Doppler ultrasound?\r\nYour doctor may suggest a Doppler ultrasound exam if you show signs of decreased blood flow in the arteries or veins of your legs, arms, or neck. A reduced amount of blood flow may be due to a blockage in the artery, a blood clot inside a blood vessel, or an injury to a blood vessel.\r\n\r\nYour doctor may order a Doppler ultrasound exam if you show signs of:\r\n\r\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside your body (usually in the leg or hip regions)\r\nsuperficial thrombophlebitis, an inflammation of the veins due to a blood clot in a vein just below the skin's surface\r\narteriosclerosis, a narrowing and hardening of the arteries that supply blood to the legs and feet\r\nthromboangiitis obliterans, a rare disease in which the blood vessels of the hands and feet become inflamed and swollen\r\nvascular tumors in your arms or legs\r\nA Doppler ultrasound can help determine the blood pressure within your arteries. It can also show how much blood is currently flowing through your arteries and veins.\r\n\r\nDoppler ultrasound\r\nAn application of diagnostic ultrasound used to detect moving blood cells or other moving structures and measure their direction and speed of movement.

This can help to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including blood clots and poor circulation. A Doppler ultrasound can be used as part of a blood flow study.<br><br>A Doppler ultrasound is a risk-free and pain-free procedure that requires little preparation. The test provides your doctor with important information about the flow of blood through your major arteries and veins. It can also reveal blocked or reduced blood flow through narrowed areas in the arteries, which could eventually lead to a stroke.<br><br>Why do I need a Doppler ultrasound?<br>Your doctor may suggest a Doppler ultrasound exam if you show signs of decreased blood flow in the arteries or veins of your legs, arms, or neck. A reduced amount of blood flow may be due to a blockage in the artery, a blood clot inside a blood vessel, or an injury to a blood vessel.<br><br>Your doctor may order a Doppler ultrasound exam if you show signs of:<br><br>deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside your body (usually in the leg or hip regions)<br>superficial thrombophlebitis, an inflammation of the veins due to a blood clot in a vein just below the skin&#39;s surface<br>arteriosclerosis, a narrowing and hardening of the arteries that supply blood to the legs and feet<br>thromboangiitis obliterans, a rare disease in which the blood vessels of the hands and feet become inflamed and swollen<br>vascular tumors in your arms or legs<br>A Doppler ultrasound can help determine the blood pressure within your arteries.

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify.

It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

Great app with easy commands and fast learning functions to users. Even my grandmother still using now :)",

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Fellow Android users, let me assist you! I had the same issues with the \"Live View\" capabilities after the recent update. Here is the fix. If you have the Arlo 2 and are not using AC power, delete all of your camera Activity Zones. You will have to go into each camera setting and open the Activity Zone. If you see a zone, swipe it to the left and it will delete the zone. Do the same for all and this should fix your issue.",
            "The camera picture is nice. But half the time it doesn't work. I'll get notification for movement but the camera will take so long to load sometimes that I could have just gone outside to where it was. The app takes super long to load and when looking at my library it ofter says \"there's nothing here\" or \"there was a problem and the arlo team is working on it\" (no they're not). Ice been on the phone many times with their customer service and it's a joke.",
            "I've been using for 2 years just fine. Now, I am also having the same issues as others. Says its not connected to power, when the battery is still full. It also will NOT let me log in 9/10 times saying \"You are not connect tonthe internet, please check your connection\" My connection to everything in this house is great. We have the highest internet available and even resetting the camera doesn't seem to help. This is my childs monitor, and this problem needs to be fixed.",
            "It was bad enough that it would take forever for this app to open up at times. Now, since I updated this app yesterday, I'm not able to view my cameras. 'AC power has been disconnected from your Arlo device. Activity Zones are currently disabled.' With a green OK box below. That's the message I have on all my cameras. I tap on the box but nothing happens. Fix, fix, fix!!!",
            "Most recent app update made things go from bad to worse. All of my cameras that run on battery now indicate a 'no AC power'message in the app. So I cannot view the cameras at all. And my one camera that does run on AC recently stopped recording at night. Support was not helpful. They told me to remove and reconnect the camera (which is mounted above the garage so not an easy task.) I did that. But the problem persists. They stopped responding to my support ticket. Arlo is useless."

            "I absolutely love this bible app. It has no ads. It's easy to read, offering lots of bible translations. You can make notes, highlights, and bookmarks easily. It also has a cool option where you can make inspirational pictures from any verse of your choice, and easy to download and share the image. I love this app! God bless 🙂",
            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

There's no way to go back or X out of it, it's just stuck there. It's a shame. What once was a good solid app is now garbage..",

Recently I moved hundreds of ebooks to the SD card on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and now I cannot get the aldiko reader to open any of those books. I've spent hours on the internet trying to find how and I'll have to change readers if you can't resolve this for me. Thank you. Blue",
            "Come on guys. Love the app, but all the adds recently. Mostly the ones that pop up when the app starts and won't let me pass, making the app unusable. No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",

It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",

I have been using keep clean a lot, and it's changed, because now there's more ads than usual. Other than that keep clean is a great app, except for the inconvenience part of it, that's why I only gave four stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐❌",
            "You have to watch a video everytime you want to add a game to the game speed up its so boring and annoying. Im dissapointed because it should keep your phone clean and safe but shows you adds for sketchy or dangerous websites like wish or dating apps. Kind of retorical if you ask me. I will update my review soon hopefully for the better.",

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

            "I'm loving the updates! Way better than what it used to be. As a truck driver, this is like always having regular TV available, especially the news and weather channels. I see people complain about the layout and function, but I think that's all on purpose! It looks vintage to go along with the programming. Only gripe would be the variety of commercials, lol!",
            "I'm not sure how this app only has 4 stars. I've been using it for over a month and I have zero complaints. First off.... there's ALWAYS something to watch. The variety of programming is impressive and I am going to say that out of Pluto, Tubi, and Crackle....Pluto TV wins hands down. Movies are unedited which is awesome. Yes.....there are commercials, but they're brief and before you know it, you're back to what you're watching. Visually, the app is beautiful to use.",
            "The app is horrific. It is not user friendly in the slightest. The catagories are horribly unorganized and there is no way to search through them. If you want to watch something, you have to comb through the database by hand until you randomly find what you're looking for. The app's poor design and execution leads to it being nearly impossible to use, which is a shame considering that the concept of a free cable app is great.",
            "Not a one star because this app is great content wise but it has a MAJOR downfall. There is no search feature. Like come on.. I watch the ads that pay for the service but you won't let me search for a movie that I want to see? I can see this app being used by almost everyone but in its current state (which hasn't changed in over a year at least) its useless. Why would I want to \"enjoy\" the old feeling of clicking through channels just to see my favorite movie started an hour ago...",
            "Avoid this app. No search capability so if you know what you want to watch you must waste countless amounts of time sifting through the catalog or give up. To add insult to injury there are way too many ads and they run the same ones over and over. I watched a 45 min show and saw the same Airforce ad 4-5 times. Commercial breaks totaled 17 minutes on top of the 45 minutes of actual show. So ads accounted for 38% of total time which is way too much. Skip this app."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",

It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",

I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email.

Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout.

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Great decoder[s] -they are very robust in many difficult conditions. Only ask would be for morse decoder for idents. Overlay or append to pic metadata.",
            "Had to uninstall and reinstall the first go around at it. The app was malfunctioning on the first download. After a second download, I was able to get it working. I was able to set it to auto mode and received some cool pics from my local radio club using my baofeng uv5r.",
            "It wasn't designed to do phone calls. Amazing how the decoder can automatically select format. Creates interesting effects when the encoder is played through an amplifier. Would like to try this in a large reverberation sized room. Working best when at lower volume not loud enough to bounce off of walls. Scottie DX is actually the only mode that doesn't smear my profile picture. I've got this encoder and decoder set on 3 of my devices. I've sent my profile picture to myself through every single mode this pair can do. Looking forward to the day I can actually use them with a radio or even home phone.",
            "I love this app, but I've had a slight problem this last time I've installed it... For some reason the save button is greyed out, and the share button doesn't seem to do anything. Is there any reason this would be happening that I'm just missing? I had to save my last image via screenshot, which isn't ideal, so I'd rather be able to use the default save feature :) I'm on Android 10 on a Nokia 7.1 Thanks for the great app!"

My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",

I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

So sad",

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "My previous review was a nice one with 4 stars. I always store wheel spins to use in bulk when something interesting comes in, and usually doesn't take long to get it, but I just spent 23 spins trying to get a prize that needed only 10 stars. It never took more than 10 tries. The difference now? This is the first time that I get gold coins as a prize. Talk about a weighted result huh? I don't need this. But it was an overall nice game that needs a bit balancing.",
            "Great game, needs endless mode, co-op, pvp, but I'm very pleased with the game so far, definitely could top archero if these were added along with events and other things I'm sure you have lots of plans for the game! Also please make the battle pass cheaper should be 4.99 like archero and also it should remove buff ads and other stuff. Archero also has evolve system now, need more content to keep up!",
            "1.) Archero killer? 2.) Still needs some tuning on movement/dodging. Seasoned Archero player so I have experience in this style of game. Controls just feel clunky. 3.) Reloads adds a new dimension to play by calculating your next move and making sure you have enough ammo. 4.) I would give this game a try and see for yourself.",
            "Slow, repetitive and grindy gameplay like archero. This game doesn't improve on archero. It has similar level up upgrades and similar enemies. You can play up to the desert stage and then get stuck because of low power. You have to replay the lower levels hundreds of times to try to level up and get better loot.",
            "Its a really fun game but it would be better if you could actually revive yourself after watching an add there's been quite a few times too many where I end up dying last wave or two and decide to watch an add to revive just to see my guy stand up then the game ends and I fail, if this continues ill probably delete zombero in fear of throwing my device"

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

At risk patients should undergo further testing.   \r\n\r\nDescription\r\nTo use PE Calc, enter a yes or no response to each of the criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Does the patient exhibit clinical signs & symptoms of DVT?\r\n\r\n2. Is PE the #1 diagnosis, or equally likely?\r\n\r\n3. Is the heart rate greater than 100?\r\n\r\n4.

When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "Constant pop ups wanting you to purchase. You have to say no to 3 ads in a row before you can spin again. A few spins later...there they are again. Hit what they consider a \"big win\" which can be quite often and guess what??? AD!!! Wanting you to multiply your winning by paying $4.99. I played for maybe 5 minutes and had to say \"No\" to so many pop-ups that I am uninstalling and never playing this game again.",
            "LOVE this slot game! I play a lot of slots, but usually delete them because you don't win and barely get enough in the daily bonus to keep playing. This one however is perfect! Lots of fun slots with different exciting bonuses on every slot (which is a must have for me, I don't like basic slots) and you ACTUALLY win! I LOVE it! Easy 5 star rating (:",
            "Early still, but it has cool slots and at least if you lose your ass, you can watch ads to earn yourself back into the game pretty quickly. That's a huge plus for me. I absolutely hate slot games that give a crappy bankroll to start and drains it in no time just to try to sell coin packages. We'll designed and big game selection too. Keep up the good work!",
            "I haven't seen \"buy this\" pop ups THIS awful since the late 90s just before pop up blockers were made to stop the disgusting greedy bs. This developer needs to get a grip. I was getting PAID to play this and try it out and I'm doing it is THAT bad. They need to rethink their policy on that. For real. Someone on their team probably deserves to be fired for this not happy nostalgia, this needs to stop. 100% trash till then. Update: just bc there's an x doesn't make the avalanch of pop ups okay.",
            "This game was great after I paid a couple bucks for a purchase to make ads go away (been playing nearly 2 yrs). But now, the Level Race and the Winning Cards are super annoying and interfere with tournaments. I get that you want to give people other options to get more coins, but you should also give players the option to opt out of these things. I buy the coins on my own and being harassed by these constant pop-ups is a deterrent. Once my coins are exhausted I'll likely just delete the app."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",

This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",

I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",

They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",

Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list.

Great game, I love it!!!!",

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "Latest update removed the widget, which is the only reason I used this dictionary app over others. The release notes don't reveal this cut (nor the removal of the offline dictionary as a free feature), so the bait and switch just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",
            "Endless problems with this app, after the recent update app crashes the moment I opened it. PLUS. Offline dictionary is utter useless. I cant search for anything when I'm offline. I don't even know the download progress of my offline dictionary. I regret paying for this app. I've been forcing myself to use this cause I paid for it but now this is way too much.",
            "EDIT I absolutely love the new layout, it's so well designed that I'm fine with this app not having a dark mode. It's a overall a great app otherwise I wouldn't pay for all the bells and whistles, however its missing a dark/black theme, if it had that it would be the perfect dictionary app 👌😎. (Thanks for taking your time to read this)",
            "Just updated, now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't respond to any touch. Now crashing. Now it works a little bit before crashing. All my recents and searches are gone. This is frustrating, don't mess with my recents list.",
            "Best dictionary and dictionary app ever. The latest redesign is beautiful, the offline dictionary download has been fixed, but it seems the speed of the app when showing the definition, even after the offline dictionary is downloaded, is considerably slower than the previous version."

After entering a site gotta go back and redue the process all over again. I don't know why this has been given so many stars ether it was useful after so many upgrades or someone likes given good ratings to crappy apps just too make other people mad.",
            "This app is really very amazing. Awesome, It cleans the whole phone in few seconds. I have never seen a phone cleaner like this. But there is very small problem and that is ads , we cannot do anything about ads. Nowadays every app contain ads. To remove ads we have to pay money 😭😭😭. Overall this app is the best phone cleaner. I have one small request to remove ads from this app👍.",
            "I like the app, but when using it advertisement pop up and if my phone rings app will not release the screen so I can answer the call. I watch most of the adds but I don't like anything that takes o Dr my phone. This may cause me to delete app again!! Just checked something today,the app has a cach cleaner. After I cleaned cach with your app, I went and checked cach on each and every app on my phone and had to clear them myself!",
            "Good app. But the ads are pretty annoying and if you want to remove them you need to pay real money for it . Wish there was an app with no ads no more annoying things . But aleast it's a pretty cool app , it can boost your phone in a second if you're phone lags so much . It will junk all the useless stuff in your phone which makes the phone cleaner. I recommend you guys to download the app",
            "This app is the best it made my phone to stop hanging and now I can use my phone without the worry of it crashing 😉 I really hope they prosper and more apps that are better than this. That's my reason for giving it five stars 😁."

            "I like the game it's it's fun you can play with it and a and also I can jump up and down and said the only thing is at the jump on my back instead of my stomach jumping I can't do backflips and I also at the light on my legs so it's pretty challenging for me but it's going to be fine So yeah so I like to know as much but it's what is popular and it's good so I gave a",
            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",
            "okok so first things first this game is literally the best and if u turn off wifi/turn on airplane mode there is so ads second things the game glitched out sometimes but it is super funny to see the characters and the trampolines dislocate themselves lastly i would totally reccomend this game and if u rate 1 star bcuz u dont like it ur a loser no offense",
            "Great game! 5-stars! I wish it was a little easier to get new flips, but other than that, fantastic! If you like gymnastics or flip games, definitely install.",
            "It is a fun game to play but it is a little hard to play you have to time your jumps right or you will land wrong there is also a lot of ads but other wise it is a good game"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

They we're just letting me know about Tom's Place. It's really good too. Kinda slow at times but it's not bad. I would definitely recommend 😊 this app.",
            "I am tired of this app crashing, repeatedly. I will be in the middle of an interesting article and the app closes and restarts. I even deleted it and reloaded it and it still happens. To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

        "description": "This app is a Pedometer with an optional periodic reminder to get you moving! Having a mostly inactive or sedentary lifestyle is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease and related circulatory problems. This coupled with the added stress of a sit down job can increase your risk of varicose veins, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). These problems lead to blood clotting, heart disease, cancer, and if left untreated even death. Note: The incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism increases exponentially with age. To help lesson these risk factors each couple of hours during the work day one should get up and walk around to improve their circulation. \r\n\r\n Enter the MovItMinder app.. The app has two modes of operations for reminders: polling via an event timer and free-form. In the polling mode the app allows you to keep tract of your level of activity and get it up to snuff during the coarse of the work day by giving you a periodic reminder to move. In the free-form mode the app just sits there in the background and keeps track of your steps as you go. In this mode when you bring up the MoveItMinder Notification you can review your progress at any time. In any event you can set the number of steps you want to take and let the app remind you when to get up and go. \r\n\r\nHow the app works: \r\n With the phone in your pocket when you walk around the step counter sensor will indicate the number of steps you have taken. Please Note: if your phone does not have a step counter sensor the app will not function. \r\n\r\nSetting Goals:\r\n By taking 10,000 steps per day on the average you will burn 500 calories, which equals a pound of fat over the course of a week. Walking this many steps can result in burning up to 3,500 calories per week, which equates to one pound. On the average you will burn one calorie for every 20 steps.\r\n\r\n The app triggers the step counter sensor when you save the parameters and put your phone in your pocket and start walking around. It runs as a service and sits in the background so you are free to do other things, and it does not care if the screen goes off.. it will still count your steps. Basic Notification feedback (sound/vibration) is given when you have met or missed your movement goals and a simple Radial Chart shows your progress (based on the 10,000 step a day recommendation or the number of steps you have entered). Simply exit the app to quit the service.. it will remember the period and number of steps and the basic configuration you have set as a goal for the next time you want to get moving reminders.\r\n\r\n The McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign indicates that 2,500 steps or less per day is very inactive, up to 5,000 steps in inactive, 5,000 to 7,500 steps is moderately active, 7,501 to 10,000 steps is active and more than 10,000 is very active. \r\n\r\nWhen Just Starting out:\r\n When just starting out try to improve your calorie burn by adding 2,000 to 2,250 steps, the equivalent of a mile in distance and 100 calories in energy expenditure each day. The calories and distances are calculated on the average taking 20 steps as one calorie burned, and every 2,250 steps taken as one mile.\r\n\r\nStandard Disclaimer: \r\n This app is no substitute for the regular physical exercise you need to maintain a healthy life style. It is just a friendly reminder to get you up and walk around every so often to help you get some better circulation. Please see your doctor regularly for any health related issues.",

It's pretty frustrating. After having my wife try it out, i did find that the UI is not user-friendly, she's used to kindle, fbr is just weird .. i guess it was simple enough for me, but maybe some UI work can be done to help noobs (like my wife)",

Please remove WAMR from all battery optimization services!\r\n\r\n3) WAMR can't save files if they aren't completely downloaded! So if you are offline or you have an unstable connection, or in general if the sender deletes the message containing a media before the messaging app downloads it, WAMR can't do anything to save it.\r\n\r\n4) If you aren't using a WiFi connection, some media may not be automatically downloaded by your messaging app because of your settings. You can change this behavior in Messaging app > Settings > Data and storage usage and increase your chances.\r\n\r\nOther limitations may be caused by your Android version, or your system language (in particular if it is right-to-left).

Often doesn't record audio, images, videos and statuses, even if notifications are on and downloading media is fully on(wi-fi and mobile data). In play market, there's only one app that records (supposed to record and save) all deleted messages, and that's WAMR.(4 stars) 10/16/2020: It can't store data on sd card...(2 stars)",
            "Everything works fab !!! The only thing which needs to be fixed is : 1. Why does it recover the media which i deleted myself from gallery. 2. It just shows the statuses which i opened rather than showing all the statuses. 3. Lastly in the status section categorize it as photos & videos. Plz fix this, it will surely rock the app...",
            "Well the app is great. But sometimes it fails to recover media even when it is fully downloaded. And now it doesn't work because I moved the contents of WhatsApp to SD card. Please fix this error. Make it so that it can still show media when it is being downloaded to SD. Otherwise it is awesome.",
            "It should be able to capture those messages and media which I haven't seen or opened. Suppose I miss a message while I am sleeping, I should be able to get those messages even when the sender has deleted it.. Otherwise it works relly perfect. Thank you for all your hard work.",
            "It is very useful in the beginning but gradullay it cannot work properly the name we cannot saved in our contact he/she sent a message to whatsapp or any other medias if they delete the message we cannot see that I cannot get the notification i enable the notification i cant get it But sometimes it is very useful app to me I suggest to everyone in this app Thankyou"

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",

Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I've played this for about a year. It's very addictive. Only reason I will not give 5 stars is because of the adverts. Although this game does not thrust adverts at you after every level like some games do, you can optionally watch an advert to get a boost. Only problem is with some adverts they start forcing you to install another app/game, or sometimes the adverts freeze, or sometimes they cause the game to restart, they have even caused the phone to reboot. This is not good.",
            "Been playing this game for a couple of years now. I like how the daily rewards don't reset if you miss a day. I love that there is always something to do. Standard mines, event mines and the mainland. It would be nice if the prestige for the standard mines wasn't so expensive. I've only managed to prestige 2 mines in 2 years although I do spend most of my time on the event mines to be fair. Nice game to spend some time on. I like how you can upgrade your miners too.",
            "The game is fun enough, but I gave it 1 star for two main reasons. The game has recently started asking me to rate it at _least_ once a day. This is incredibly annoying, but here's your review. The other reason is that I was just offered the \"no-ads\" offer for $15, and coincidentally the game now freezes nearly every time I click on an ad for a boost. I keep having to exit the game, try to watch an ad again and hope maybe it works. I feel like maybe the two things are related. ETA: I did email.",
            "great little clicker, perfect for when you have a few minutes to spare, fast user interface and heaps of things to do, lots of freebies and a steady (if not a little slow) way to make premium credits however some of the in game purchases are fairly expensive, but honestly they're not necessary to progress in the game.",
            "The game is designed to kill time, it does that. Puzzles are my favorite, but when I'm on hold and still have to pay attention to my world this kills the time. Don't expect to be grabbed by how in depth or awesome this game isn't. Just click to fidget. Do I love it, no. Does it work as planned, yup."

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app 💗💗💗 However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

The Pro version (11 Oct 2016)  has NO sound and the channel it played in HD (720) with no sound on the free version  DOES NOT work with Pro ($9.99) version.

The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "It's great except today when I went to use nearly all of it on buying funny money for a game I play, only a portion of it showed up as my play balance. There was almost $10 unaccounted for, and no, that money had not expired. It was missing from the current balance shown in the app. This is very annoying and now I can't get what I wanted to.",
            "Still good 1yr l8r. You get random questions depending on your personal allowances on your phone. You answer a few questions and get some money from it. The amount of money depends on the survey but it all adds up!! It's easy to use your balance. This app doesn't take over your notifications. It'll notify you then leave you alone. I enjoy that aspect since so many other app continue to bombard you with reminder after reminder. I would recommend this app to anyone who want just a bit extra money.",
            "Easy to accrue google rewards. I either use on a mobile game or audio books, but there a plenty more options. Easy way to get play money, although it takes a little while to accrue a decent amount, but for the small amount of time investment it is super simple. Since August 30, 2018 until now, Oct 29, 2020 I have acquired $118.85 and I have completed 467 surveys. Some may worry about giving information, to me...I don't really care.",
            "I havent gotten a single survey since I downloaded the app, I have no idea of that is on purpose or not, but I really had hoped to have been able to get at least on survey, but I havent and so I feel that there is little to no reason to have the app...at least for me to have it, but everyone says its great, and so I'm hoping in a future update, yall add more surveys, and spread them out fairly.",
            "Super easy to do. I kinda even wish it asked me surveys more frequently. I love this app, all the small amounts eventually add up. It's too bad the money express though, and that you you can only buy things from the play store that you have the balance to pay for entirely from your Google balance, you can't for example use $10 of Google money that you have and then pay the rest with a different payment source"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",

Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "Great! Perfectly useful for local weather situations. As well as, checking the weather all over the world. I personally, use it to warn my friends in the Philippines, when Typhoons are coming (which happens all the time). I live on the opposite side of Earth in New England USA. If it's noon here, it's the following midnight there. Exactly opposite side of Earth.",
            "This app has improved so much, especially as of lately. I gave it 5 stars initially but then noticed issues of it not having completely accurate weather in a timely manner, at least in my area. But it's been really great as of late & I use it several times a day for my city as well as my dad's city. Thank you for the improvements, very much appreciated.",
            "A terrific app, easy to navigate, it's like someone actually designed an app that knows what a human want to see or find. Simple, swipe up/down or across. I like hourly detail, this app shows initial detail at a glance, slide up, you have hourly. Some apps you have to slide all damn near to the bottom. Not this app, they're labeled at the top. Simply put, great app.",
            "great app for the most part, although it does take time to much time to load in my opinion , it would be great if this app gave the pollen count I rate this app @ 3 because of these issues; The radar hangs up( freeze up ) while selecting the layers exp; wind speed; clouds etc; Other these small issues this app is great; I would like to see the cloud ceiling measurement as other weather apps have",
            "Most accurate, user friendly weather app I've used to date. The adsi find reasonable and alerts are all in fair timing. I especially like the FYI tidbits at opening, but they can be turned off if you choose. Only reason for not giving 5*is because on occasion the discussion tab is a little more distant than I consider \"local weather.\""

Ultrasonography can diagnose stenosis through the direct visualization of plaques and through the analysis of the Doppler waveforms in stenotic and poststenotic arteries.

Conventional angiography is used for vascular interventions such as angioplasty or stent application, as well as in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. Doppler US is the only noninvasive technique that does not require contrast enhancement, preparation of the patient before the study, or radiation exposure.

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "I like what the app offers, but I cannot get it to stop freezing up. I've used it on my smart TV, laptop, and phone. It will freeze and the whole app has to be rebooted. Usually at least 2 or 3 times per episode. Very frustrating.",
            "Don't get me wrong for rating the app with one star, I do love this app but, the problems are the ads, and when I tried to subscribe, it said I can't do it at the moment, so when I checked the app store for the apps that are (subscribed) the only one that showed up was viki. And guess what? I still have got few weeks until the subscribtion expires but still all the shows and movies are locked, so please tell me what is going on and what is the problem here",
            "Im unable to fastforward drama or backward it,each time i leave the app to do something when I'm back i have to start the same episode from the begining pls fix this,i appreciate your efforts on this app but still needs to do better,it is really annoying.",
            "I really like this app! My main concern is the advertisements. Okay, I'm actually not too bothered by how frequent they are, I'm a patient person and I understand that's how the app is able to run, but sometimes the ad has trouble loading and freezes. A 30 second ad will have me wait two minutes bc it takes so long to load. And I know I can get vikiplus to avoid ads but I'm poor. Besides that, the quality of the dramas are clear and the captions are well made!",
            "It's really wonderful application .it's help to find lots of drama here. Am satisfied with this.but the problem is with resolution because we can't adjust what we want, sometimes network can't help to watch in that time we only can help with adjust the resolution but here there is no adjustments in this application!. can you fix with that others wise it's a good app👍"

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

If I want to start watching prime time etc from the beginning, I have to go alllll the way back through all the episodes.. When catching up on nxt i have to close my eyes while scrolling through all the epispdoes (in reverse) to avoid spoilers. Also open up the vaults already! More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",
            "Love WWE Network! I can watch anything from WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, NWA, all the territories, etc. It is so amazing! Also love all the original WWE shows exclusive to the app. If you love wrestling like I do I can't imagine my life without this app in it. I watch it everyday. For example I just binged every WWE Monday Night Raw from 1998 and just started 1999 season! UNREAL!!!",
            "Could be a lot better, I was still getting ads even though I'm a subscriber, I can't listen to shows in the background as if you leave the app it pauses the video you where watching the app needs significant improvements because of how much it's missing when compared to other streaming services",
            "I love the network..ive never had a problem with it and have been a member since 2014..how come its not letting me go on it. Ive refreshed a bunch of times and have gotten the same results which has been just lag and errors. Please help a loyal fan and customer out. Thanks",
            "Horrible. The ap will not allow me to choose Bell as my subscription option. There fore I cannot watch anything live on my phone. I use Google Chrome and still I get a 400 error message when I click on Bell. Very frustrated and unhappy"

            "I like this game very much. I finish very few games and it is also one of them. but this game is laging but my phone is 6 GB ram and 17 GB free space. I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

I advise you to put the mark erase all text instead of pushing the user to do long press. Placing a paste button. About quick translation, the user does not want to translate every text he copied, here I advise you to use the Google Translator method by showing a floating icon. Often user want to purchase app with one-time payment, add this option and set the price you want.",

If I could add someone to chat with from contact list and the other person talk in Spanish and I see it in English and vice-versa that would be optimal. I dont understand who I'm chatting with? What am I missing? I understand now this is a person next to person item. Real time face to face. If you could work with slatch.io and mix in a realtime translated chat you would take over the world.",

            "Despite the good premise of the game it has way too many ads. Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag. Secondly, there are so many ads that I feel as if I spend more time watching those than playing the game, EVEN WITH IT TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF LAG. This app completely isn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",
            "This game is good but the lag and ads are annoying,I certainly hate this and we spend alot watching ads then playing the game,this game have problems,glitches,Etc.I never experience a game that have 1,000 ads in a day more like everyday i'm going to uninstall it.",
            "Glitch...when I win the first game...a Google ad comes on screen in the middle of the game in progress and no X to get rid of the screen"

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

The game is no longer enjoyable.",

That's all cya",
            "I've been playing this game for years its so enjoying sometimes when i'm bored i delete the game but when i remember the game i install it again, The reason i only gave 4 stars bcuz there's no more updates like new weapons new stages and others i'll give u 5 stars if u add an update. Thank You.",
            "This game needs more updates, like weapons, characters, 3 RPG save slots, and more customization like a sandbox mode where you choose enemies and their weapons and map customization. I have 100% the game I beat all the campaigns single and co-op 3 stars maxed out RPG stats for player and weapons and all stages. Endless mode single 28 is my best, co-op 48 I intend to raise them further. This game has awesome music by the way.",
            "actual broken game, it said realistic physics but the enemy's weapons can go right through your weapon no problem and enemy's with no head hitbox? oh ok, I almost completely destroyed my phone because of this game, don't download if you want to have a mental breakdown",
            "Its a good game, but I got bored of the combat. Its too simplistic, and it almost feels luck based. It was a thrill before, but now its uninteresting, and a game not fun, isn't worth playing. It can waste time though. Rpg mode is a grind"

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "This was my go-to app until about a month ago. I have to go out and then reload it frequently to get the current info. It often gets stuck at a time hours earlier. It's raining and it does not note that. Another app has 37% chance of rain in my current location (which is about right), and this app says 6% while it rains. I'm uninstalling it in favor if a better, more accurate app. I rely on relative accuracy with updates because I plan outdoor activities.",
            "The widget has started routinely saying \"weather data not available\". When it does actually show the weather, it is usually not current, actually showing the weather from hours & hours ago. Also, it takes a really long time to start up, which it didn't used to do. Whatever \"improvements\" have been made to this app have been horrible, & have made it much slower & much worse than it used to be. I'm looking around for other options, so I can unload what has unfortunately become a major turkey.",
            "I had this app for years and it began to have really low speed opening up. I uninstalled it and went with another app. The speed on it was fine, just had a lot of ads. I went back to The Weather Channel app hoping it had improved. IT HAS NOT!!! It just keeps spinning and draining my battery. It's been 15 minutes and still spinning. Poor, poor performance. Not pleased with this at all.",
            "TOO MANY ADS!! There is a ad that you are forced to watch after every video!! Also the sound quality is VERY POOR on almost every video, then the ad comes on and is extremely loud. It's annoying to have to constantly adjust the volume level for every video and ad! This app has been getting worse with every update!! The other weather apps are much better and more detailed. Sorry Weather Channel but I think I will be uninstalling your app now and I don't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Wish I had never updated this app. My old weather channel app was so much better. Every time I try to shrink the map, there's very little to no response. I have to tap the screen and then try to shrink the map so I can see a broader View, but almost every time I do that, the app has to restart. The old map showing national weather would respond very well to the touch of my fingers. Not so anymore."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

Pros: Fast, nice UI, and easy to use Cons: Ads (inserted into downloaded pictures), seeing same ads, and a lack of a block user button. If I don't want to see the same user's posts, then I should be able to hide all, if they don't want to add such a feature. Overall, its better than the older third-party apps on the Play Store.",

Needless to say, I'm completely addicted to everything spooky Reddit has to offer! 🎃🖤",

While I've not been an avid user until recently, I assume these are new issues. If not and these have been known issues, gyst.",

There's always something for me to enjoy, but that's only if the app doesn't randomly crash constantly and have to be completely restarted so anything you might have been working on is just lost (only on app). Still rather annoying. Only started recently....please fix!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Love you, reddit devs 😍😏😁",

That being said, for the traditional \"hanging out\" experience, r/All is always there. Also, the app actually works, unlike some other social media sites that couldn't make a functional product if you gave them 13 years and $1.1billion. (*cough* Tumblr *cough*)"

It's annoying since I have to go on the app very 15mins to check if i have any messages, and it also sometimes doesn't even send despite having a good connection. Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",
            "Gameplay has become fantastic since the last update. Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence. I have earned over 30 million essence but still haven't finished it up yet. But the legendary essence is getting finished quickly. Please resolve this issue.",
            "such a great game to play, even without in-app purchases. Down fall is, glitches during power-ups, exits app during battle or during a game purchase. Fix the huccups :( even after this little update, game still cuts out during game play. Really sad, I'd like a refund",

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Functional, But support is non-existent. Contacted the developers via facebook, email, etc. about the fact that my old tablet couldn't download the paid videos and my new phone wasn't compatible, which in itself is ludicrous (Huawei Honor 9 running Android 9.0), and there has been zero response after 6 days. Luckily I have another tablet.",
            "I have had to purchase these videos twice I have already paid for them and yet when I try and practice them there is an error message that comes up saying \"can't play this video\" I tried to contact the help centre and there is another error which shows up. This is unfair I have already paid twice now. I would not recommend it to anyone 😠",
            "Brilliant app! Didn't buy full version so only got 2 clips (as I knew how hazard perception works) but definatly worth getting the full version if you are unsure about it. 5*",
            "Payed for the full version of this app and got all the videos, completed ten or more then closed the app, next time I opened the app all videos locked again except for the first two, clicked restore and it said no purchase found 😡",
            "The click register at once. It also allows you to replay as to review your mistakes. It is brilliant and users friendly."

But when I return to my files I still saw those empty folders in which Ihink aw viruses and worms. I've deleted them how many times yet they are stilling coming back hours after. Dunno what to do anymore huahua. Gon change my review if you guys have seena and responded. Just wanna know if it's your app or it's my phone already. Thank you!",

I am so grateful and recommended it to everyone",
            "Good app actually it scans and detects any harmful apps or virus that is Installed into your device without your knowledge .i am facing a problem an app or something i don't know it simply installed into my device and it affects me working on my device it suddenly opens chrome whenever i turn on my data.even if i uninstall it again installs itself.it would be really helpful if you can make this app to prevent any app or software installed into the device without the user's consent."

            "A year ago I gave this 4 stars. However I now give it 1 star. You can no longer watch videos to earn credits, the only way to get credits is by paying! You can't get noticed unless you use credits to \"rise up\" or use credits to be \"seen more\"! Plus you need credits to message. In the swipe left/right part of the app, the vast majority of people shown are 20-90 miles away!? Presumably if you pay then you'll see local people? I am however currently giving it another try and I'm enjoying it more",
            "Disappointing. The App was very much focused on getting you to pay. The search doesn't work well as it is based on people paying to be moved up. Before you could at least watch ads to get extras. But that seems to be going and it is becoming even more a cash grab. I didn't mind the as option as I understand that the can't operate for nothing. But seems to have gone too far now. A shame",
            "This is a really well made app and probably my favorite dating app I've seen so far. Its full of friendly people, has a good system in place to prevent bots, and is LGBTQ friendly which is really cool. The problem is you have to pay to see who liked you which is really annoying and makes it hard to talk to anyone who doesnt have premuim or is obsessive and uses the 'crush' feature on you which also kind of has to be paid for. Overall it's a good app, I just wish it wasnt another pay to date app",
            "That is a tricky application , you pay for nothing after some message you will not able to send more. And they send you to another way to pay more. To adding... although i had pay for a week to try it ... i could only write some message and then \" you are able to write more with 200 credit\" this is the message that mean with about 30-40 €/month . Your respons is totaly confused. Ma credits isn't the money that i had payed once? And i must take them from somewhere to use here?",
            "The freebies are not workin. It's been over a month since I've been able to use it to get points. I've uninstalled the app more then 5 times and its still not workin. Can you please fix the freebies? Also lots of profiles are fake ppl. They don't verify their acct. They shouldn't be able to use app or contact anyone if they are not verified to be real. To many scammers. Please do something to fix that."

            "Sad to say this game has gone south fast. Ucool only cares about implementing new features to make money and shun players who have been playing since beginning. 5 years of playing and they introduce new feature called awakening that made all my past purchases irrelevant. It is basically like a reset button on your account. Only new players actually benefit here and also get better packages offered for purchase it was discovered recently. I am on a lower server and all players I know in the range and above have never seen the packages offered on the newer servers. Do not waste your time with this game better options available.",
            "Devs don't care about those who play and game constantly has issues. Pay to win only now, expect to pay tons. Longtime players got screwed as past purchases were cancelled out with new format put in. I do not understand how this is legal. Don't waste your time is my advice.",
            "I've been playing for 4 years now and its still fun to play but this awakening thing has gotten out of hand. It would cost hundreds a month to stay competitive and it's getting worse by the day. If I had to start all over it would be on a cheaper version.",
            "Stay away from this game unless you have $5000 to invest in. Completely ruining the game with all the pay-to-play options which has led to hackers on fake accounts and the influx of level 90 characters on these 200 type servers and then openly selling accounts on your Facebook page. All your company cares about is driven by money and you're just catering to the VIP 15 and higher which is then leading to an influx of cheats, hacks and fake accounts then leading to selling those accounts."

            "It's been years now since I've started using Poweramp as my primary music player, and I would say it's still the best Android music player out there. I also VERY MUCH appreciate how you added the \"Play next\" & \"Queue\" option, because before that, I thought that was the only thing this app was missing. It just makes it a lot more convenient. However, is there something I can toggle in settings that would fix the distortion whenever there's a notification or when the screen times out?",
            "At first the app couldn't find any audio files on my device, even after I went out of my way to give it explicit permission to access all files and then perform a \"full rescan.\" After reinstalling it and trying again, it worked. I wish I could sort by album artist so that artists like \"X feat. Y\" would not show up separately from \"X\". This issue makes it hard for me to sort through my library.",
            "This is the best of the best music player available for Android right now!! I have tried a variety of music players in the store, but none were upto my liking. When I listen to music, I am more concerned about the audio quality it delivers, rather than how the UI looks. This player serves both purpose by delivering a clear, balanced sound in all tones and a clean and smooth user interface. This is a must-have app for all music lovers like me.",
            "I have been using this app for years. I first downloaded it on S2 Mini running on Android Honeycomb when the rest of the world was on KitKat. I was so glad to have such a powerful app running on such an old device and the equalizer settings really helped to make the listening very delightful. Now running on S10Plus with Android 10, well its just too easy to set it up and enjoy listening to music. Thank you for making this app the best music player app I've ever used since 2015...",
            "Very nice app with amazing animations and customization. However, I HAD no idea how to add my existing playlists and there are a bunch of audio tracks that use audio from videos on my phone. These are deep in the settings app and theres no reason they should be so hard to find Theres also a ton of customization that I have no idea about and I wish I could just disable the equalizer so I stop opening it. Still an amazing app, but a couple glaring but fixable issues"

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",

The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",

But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Honestly its annoying, shouldn't once be enough already? now i can't even get into my account cause they're asking for my phone number, and it says that its unsupported, which doesn't make sense cause thats what i've been using 4 making accs..",

It doesn't go back to the tweet I was looking at. Can you please fix it everything was working fine before :)",

Thought it was because of the connection or it just needs an update but no, it took forever before it worked properly. It gave me a scare cause suddenly it wouldn't load the interface, I even thought I was hacked. Please make an announcement if you had a downtime, outage etc.",
            "As many have already pointed out and subsequently ignored by the devs, the latest update is a complete disaster. Everything has slowed down to a crawl, it's laggy, notifications don't work and there is no transparency in what exactly is changed or improved with each download just \"bugfixes\" they write, who knows what stuff they are secretly adding or doing that effects your private things.

            "Loved this app until I got paid version. There are too few filers and it gets boring. None of the previous filters are in it, and I've seen many over the past couple of years. The fun section still only does side by side comparison instead of the whole picture. I'm not sure why it's so expensive with so few features. What it does do, it does very well. Impressions and presets are almost identical, make up too. A few pre-made looks could do the trick e.g \"Beach babe\" , \"barbie\", \"dictator\"",
            "I absolutely love this app. There is honestly no better app of its type. A massive problem though, is that I couldn't pay for the lifetime membership :( - the monthly plan works, but i wanted the lifetime plan... I'm new to Android, so if it's something that I need to fix, can you please inform me. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, and added many different payment methods (all with enough money in the accounts) my problems aside, even the free version of this app is worth 5 stars.",
            "This is the first time I'm saying, \" Today, 22-10-2020, I'm declaring that if there is a option to give 7 🌟, then I must give that. Seriously 😘. This AI app is the best of best! If I want to change the face or other tasks it will take an hour in Photoshop. Thanks for giving us Pro feature using Ad. Stay happy all the time, take care and stay safe at home 🏡.",
            "I absolutely love this app! There are still so many features available even without the paid version, and they actually all look real!! However, I am encountering one issue. For some reason, the \"My kids\" 1 and 2 are taking FOREVER to load. I know it's not an wifi problem because all the other ones load just fine and my wifi is really good. I will definitely change my review to a 5 star once this is fixed, thank you!",
            "This app is very good. I love the option on the app that allows you to see what your future children may look like. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because of minor errors such as having the girls look like 80 year old men or making the children look more like girls in the boy part instead of boys. I also suggest that this app would be really cool if an anime option was added. I've seen videos on this, and I think it would make the app more successful and up in rankings! Thanks!"

            "absolutely loved this app. I have been using it for months but after the recent update, they made the makeup tool vip. I'm probably gonna delete the app now since it was my most used tool and i can't afford it now",
            "This app has been pretty valuable for me over the years that I've been using it. I tolerated when they decided to lock some features, since the more essential tools remained free and are uniquely useful enough to keep the app. I just had to look elsewhere for the other stuff. But when I went to use it today, I noticed they locked even more features - the essentials, aka the tools they've been most notable for. A pretty foolish move, honestly. So I'll be deleting.",
            "Reshape tool now requires a paying subscription, and it's not cheap! You used to be able to use it, you just needed to watch an ad whenever you saved your photo, but I guess they've gotten greedier. It was the only reason I used Facetune at all - all of the other tools are free on many other apps. Save yourself the trouble and money, just download any free photo editor.",
            "Certain things aren't free anymore, I don't like how you guys are taking the best free features away just to force people into subscribing. I also see how you guys made some features free which are tools I don't use for editing. This used to be the perfect app for selfie editing, for a long time too! But now it's useless to me. You guys are a sad case. I would give it 5 stars but no thanks. Uninstalling",
            "When I first downloaded this only a few of the edit options weren't available for free. It seems every time I go to edit now, more free things are getting taken away. Before it was reasonable, it's just ridiculous at this point. Looking to try different apps because trying to force users into buying your subscription is insane."
