This was inefficient, so I started writing them down. After summarizing and analyzing a few dozen articles, I figured why not share them with other learners?

            "Originally had issue with premium paid version, but it was resolved with the developer after a few months. It is very comprehensive on stroke trials, and has many updates with the new trials. Great for medical students and residents on the go for quick summaries. Wiki journal club lacks extensive stroke trials, so this app fills that gap nicely. I do prefer wiki journal club's breakdown of trial design, population, interventions, and outcomes as things lumped under results.",
            "I had access issues initially but customer service was excellent and the app works for me now. I love it and it is very useful. I would like to see improved search function in the future though, because you can really only search for a study if you know the title of it.",
            "First, after you buy it you will be asked to pay again and again. Now after the update when trying to restore my account, it tells me that I can't.",

He has a very long term recovery ahead, and this app looks like it would help, but I also have to consider his feelings.",
            "For a recovery app that is intended for adults that have had a stroke or other brain injury it is very juvenile. same set up as the kids games. Make it friendly for all age groups. The encouraging voice is to childish and the whoka word it says is very annoying. Please make this so it is geared for adults. Thank you.",

I use this app with my cousin with Autism, and while it requires us to tutor him at times, he quite likes the app and finds I easy it use.

            "The questions were easy to understand. Age was not as easy to answer as date of birth would have been. (have to calculate it). On page 2 the BMI graph is missing under the colour explanation when I press (i) help. The App does NOT seem to accommodate multiple users. Appears that extra users must buy/own their own phone or tablet and install app. Users have to have or create a Facebook account to use advance features. I DONT like that. Good start though, and look forward to participating.",
            "I love it. This app is really helpful for the general people. I personally appreciate the Bangla translation initiative as most of the app do not support Bangla language. And I recommend to make premium content free from such condition. I shared the link but people do not install it. What can I do then? The condition should be limited to just sharing, not installing from the link. Besides, please build an alternative lite version for those people who have limited data or poor interent speed.",
            "Good app. It will help to save your health and health of your relatives. It can be used by doctors to help people to understand their risks and control them. Also you can put your two cents to reduce stroke burden in the world if you join the study offered in the app. Хорошее приложение. Пригодится каждому, чтобы понять, на что обратить внимание для сохранения своего здоровья и здоровья своих близких. Поможет врачу убедить пациента выполнять рекомендации. По желанию, Вы можете внести свою лепту в снижение бремени инсульта, если поучаствуете в исследовании, предложенном в приложении.",

            "Interesting logical game. Draw the shape with 1 line. It would be nice if we could view our achievements on the game instead of having to visit my account each time. I seem to be earning achievements in the wrong order. I have earned achievements for clearing 50 puzzles in a level before clearing 10 or 25 and I have achieved 25 before doing 10. I have an achievement for clearing all the basic levels before finishing level 1.",

            "Adpocalypse nightmare. Ads in every corner. Popup ads every few minutes. And then the really long unskippable ads. I'm only 40 puzzles in on the first \"level\" and I feel like a majority of my time was spent watching ads because the puzzles at the beginning only take about three seconds to beat. Just let me pay for the game.",
            "This is the best mouse trap. Look no further. Such a nice break from the high-gloss, hyper-edit, aural miasma with which we are constantly bombarded. A great way to \"snap out of it\". I find this type of logic is right in my wheelhouse, so, all I do is \"truly\" immerse myself in this 98% AD FREE... THAT'S 98% AD FREE!! game. That, in an of itself piqued my interest.

            "I really liked the app and wanted to support the developer. The pen that came with the free version worked great, so I thought the other pens would be great as well. Man I was never so wrong! The other pens suck! On top of that, this is the first experience with in app purchases on Android. Guess what? No refund! This guy must have been an Apple developer! I don't mind supporting hard working developers, I just wished I could get my money back and give it to someone who deserved it.",
            "ANY drawing/painting app worth it's price has a re-size option for the tools being used.  This app however is lacking this basic feature, and since my 1st review in april/2014, nothing's been done.  It seem's the developer has abandoned this app.  It look's like i'll have to find a better app with this feature and just abandon this app, like the developer has...",
            "One pen. No color palette. No other tools or effects. Have to buy them to see if they're worth it.  Waste of time.",
            "Nice clean interface but with only one tool and one color to use (and only at one brush size) there's really not much you can do. How are we supposed to trust the app is to our liking when everything is locked down (and you have to buy colors, brushes, etc all separately?). Shame. A timed trial seems like a more sensible idea if the developers expect people to use it and buy."

            "It is such a great app and helps a lot in learning the correct strokes order. Especially the font style is one I like which helped me make a pretty handwriting. Lately this app won't show any strokes order and would only do so if you buy it :( I have been using this app for over a year now and being a student, it was a big help. Kindly make it free.",
            "Excellent app which has proved very helpful for me to learn Chinese characters. It has basic, but useful features such as adjusting the speed at which the strokes appear. Unfortunately the ads have been getting more and more intrusive lately. I understand developers need revenues for their work, but the sound ads are very distracting - fix that and I would happily give the app a perfect score.",
            "Really enjoying this app at the moment. It doesn't try to force some kind of over simplified learning game like many language apps do. My favourite thing about it is that it recognises both traditional and simplified input. I just wish there was an easy way to see or compare simplified VS traditional characters in the meaning tab.",
            "I love this app on ios. I use it all the time on my iPhone and ipad. I just got an android phone and was disappointed to find half the features missing and no option to buy a pro version either. Why no picture search and why do I have to just accept disruptive adds popping up all the time? Translation isn't working at all, the interface is clunky up... I could go on.",
            "A good idea, the basic functionality works well but the 'translate' options don't work so I'm constantly switching back and forth between Google Translate. Please fix this."

I played it for some time and went on to another app, I did not find this game in the running apps nor on my apps screen. I could only uninstall it going to play store.",

It keeps running in the background and throws a pop up everytime phone unlocks or even if you're doing some other activity on the phone. DO NOT INSTALL!!!",

Once the app is downloaded and you open it The game Icon will disappear from everywhere and then after every few minutes Advertisements Ads will keep popping up on your phone regardless this game is open or not or whatever you are doing Also the Ads will pop even if there's nothing running in the background.

            "I purchased the application many years ago. Have used it on water and with the onset of Covid-19, I am using it more on land along with a PM3. My observations are: The programs are great and can be reconfigured to your personal like. Lots of analytical data provided. Some of the issues I'm having, every stroke I take, a note appears on the screen asking if I'm finished with the workout. Stroke counter is not accurate and jumps 3 to 7 units at times. Have ordered PM5 see if it makes a difference",
            "Potentially a very interesting application with lots of features, in reality it did not work for me. In only tried it in the boat, mainly to display basic information like stroke rate and speed. I appreciated the possibility to customize my own screen. Real flaw (with my phone) was that the stroke rate could not be determined reliably.  Besides that I had practical problems while running it on my phone. It drained batteries too much, because the screen had to stay up. That caused the screen to be dimmed, which made it really unreadable. I had to use a waterproof sleeve which made that harder too. There were some annoying system pop-ups I could not suppress. And then there was the question how to reliably and readably attach the phone to the boat. So in my experience, this might work for a cox, but not for a rower.",
            "20$ Boatcoach upgrade + $5 phone drybag > $400 speed coach. Rate isn't always perfect in my experience but the basic upgrade is well worth it and programing function is fantastic. Haven't even looked at the live stream overly yet but excited to try it. Totally exceeded my expectations!",
            "Used for sculling but not erging - amazing app, does everything that you could possibly want from a surge coach but better. Screen and numbers are clear and easy to read between strokes, and the accuracy is great. Also paid for the csv function and I highly recommend it. Pairs well with data visualization software to create your own custom dashboards. Also customer service is excellent, app creator responded quickly and helpfully to some questions. Highly recommended for anyone in small boats.",
            "Why is this app asking me to have so much access to my device. There is not even an option to deny and even see the home page and browse. The way I see it as they are manipulating their users to give them permissions even before they have seen the app. Not cool BoatCoach"

        "description": "AF-STROKE\r\n\r\nAF-STROKE is a simple application to assess patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) against stroke risk factors and to help choose appropriate antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention. It calculates at once CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and HAS-BLED scores and creatinine clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Based on the score results, the latest ESC and AHA/ASA advice on antithrombotic therapy is given.

I am often finding my strokes aren't detected properly by the \napp. I am making the correct stroke, and the app knows I have made A \nstroke, but it doesn't think I've done the correct one.

This app claims to be designed for aphasia (a language disorder, generally in the adult/geriatric population), but seems much more appropriate for expressive language disorders in children (which is characterized by children having difficulties forming language, but can pronounce speech sounds correctly). Regardless, if this app encourages practice to reach goals set by a trained/certified SLP, it is beneficial.",

            "Just finished first round. No complaints. Works perfectly on Galaxy gear as well. Edit I've noticed that the meterage seems to be out by about +8% while playing. I have everything switched from yards to meters but still get about 217m on the 200m marker at multiple courses. Same with stroke distances. 275m drive on the watch is down to 255m when reviewing the round on the phone after. Using galaxy watch and pixel 3 phone in australia.",
            "Loved this app up until yesterday. It was the only reason I bought a Samsung Active2 watch. Worked fantastic until Samsung released the latest OS for the Active2. This app no longer works. It loads on the watch but when you click \"Add New Round\" on the watch nothing happens. Was able to replicate the issue on another Active2. I despise sloppy testing. New releases should not break functionality on apps. The app runs fine on the phone but super clunky to use that interface while golfing.",
            "Great; when it works. Positive: Runs on Samsung watch, so there's no need to be pulling out your phone after every stroke. Shows distance to hole at a glance. A single tap records each stroke with club, position, and distance. Stats and analysis of individual rounds and aggregate. Negative: Occasionally does not upload results at end of round, which are then lost. No support (none!), limited documentation. Distances are generally spot-on but occasionally wildly inaccurate (with no in-between). Although rounds are uploaded (usually) to cloud there is no way to view anything on the web; you must use your phone/tablet. Recommended for casual golfer.",
            "I'm going to echo what others are saying. Loved this app up until 9/25/2020. It was the only reason I bought a Samsung Active2 watch. Worked fantastic until Samsung released the latest OS for the Active2. This app no longer works. It loads on the watch but when you click \"Add New Round\" on the watch nothing happens. Please fix. Prior to this issue I'd give it a solid 5 stars for its watch capabilities. Now 0. Please fix this error.",
            "Needs a Quick scoring option in addition to individual club tracking. If you End Round with no club selection (score is zero), golfer should be able to add score with + and - buttons and confirm. Love app otherwise. Many times golfers don't want to be forced into detailed scoring. Works great on my Active 2."

            "This is a great app! I was surprised how simple, yet difficult it can be. Kind of startling... and amazing how easy simple distrations can interrupt your thought process. I will continue to work with this.",
            "I can't properly rate the app as I only used it once, but I couldn't find any other place for \"customer service.\" As I previously stated I'm a first time user, & was reading everything I can before the app. It was reccommended by PT for my CRPS in my knee, which this app doesn't address but the concept is still helpful. On your about page you have words like yarning instead of yawning, that needs to be change. There are a few more edits needed, but that jumped off the page.",
            "Fantastic tool. Worth it for medical professionals and their patients/clients right across the entire pain spectrum to start the \"self\" rediscovery journey to self management with little to no medical intervention. What a gift for all of us who suffer 24/7 with these horrible & debilitating \"invisible\" (& therefore usually dismissed, belittled & not often believed) chronic/complex nerve pain syndromes. Maybe this could even help save some lives. Going to share the hell out of this app to get the word put. Well done Development Team! .. Thankyou",
            "not as easy as you would think it would be! Really makes you think! I can see why this may help with my condition of CRPS! My Dr. wants me to use the program three times a day for three times a day for the first month, and then once a day there after. Thanks for giving the first levels for free! I have been using for a full month now snd plan to keep using the program!",

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me.

        "description": "For very long time, nervous system injuries and diseases were thought to be irreversible, although neuroplasticity (ability of cells to change continuously throughout an individual's life )  was discovered in 1923 by American scientists Karl Leshley.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it has been confirmed that nerve cells continue to regenerate throughout life, not just until adulthood is achieved.\r\n\r\nThe following is an abstract from scientist Bernhard A Sabel 2017 study     https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard_Sabel\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27504612\r\n \r\n\r\nIn summary, visual training stimulates restoration of affected areas and electrical stimulation does so in a shorter amount of time.\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout this program\r\n\r\nThis program provides visual training of the retina, optic nerve and visual cortex through the range of visual algorithms. What has been proven is that visual exercises subjectively and objectively affect visual functions. The question remains, what kind of visual stimulation algorithms work the best?\r\n\r\nThe initial purpose of this program was to help myself and to add another potential tool to slow down the progress of my own glaucoma. As of November 2019, it has been 20 years since my initial diagnosis and I am doing well. The glaucoma specialist who treated me all these years deserves my deepest gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use this program\r\n\r\nLook at the center fixation point but take notice of each flash on the screen. Some flashes are completely random and others are somewhat predictable through the use of different geometric algorithms. In some ways, the training is similar to an actual visual field test experience, but there is no anxiety or pressure that is usually present.\r\n\r\nI recommend practicing twice daily, no longer than 20 minutes at a time. During each session, practice 5 to 6 options, 3 to 5 minutes each. Select different background colours, object sizes and intervals. Switch between larger and smaller object sizes and intervals. Practice with each eye separately but also with both eyes.\r\n \r\nImmediately stop if your eyes become tired. Do not practice longer than 20 min in one session.\r\n\r\nI recommend listening to music while watching the flashes.  It will be less boring and it would involve other important brain areas. Many studies have established that there is a enhancing link between visual and auditory cortex performance.\r\n\r\nNote: Program can be used on the desktop if one of Android emulators is downloaded.\r\n\r\nMost importantly is to regularly visit your eye specialist and follow their advice, take your drops as prescribed, exercise and follow healthy eating directions. \r\n\r\n*Disclaimer:  It is important to emphasize this program does not replace the help of a glaucoma specialist and does not claim to cure or slow the progression of glaucoma.\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

            "Well, it's a just good app. But it might just be my tablet, but I ran into a problem no one else seemed to address. Whenever I have the app pulled up, the volume on my tablet is fine, but then when I exit the app or shut off my tablet while I am using the app then my volume is reduced to zero. It's usually not a problem, but when I'm say, listening to music? It goes completely mute whenever I have to import a picture or grab a reference. If this flaw could be fixed, that would be amazing.",
            "It's a good app. Though there isnt rly any difference between this app and the free version. The prime membership in the free app is about £3, but i had to pay £8 for this and still have tp pay £3 to unlock filters and materials etc. The only difference rly is that it has more filters in it, like anime background and manga background and others, which i rarely use",
            "Well I will be honest there's almost not difference between the free version and this one I mean yea there's no commercials on the top screen anymore and yea the tools you can customize them like you like and there free 24/7 but I was expecting more besides that I feel like I wasted money on it. It was my birthday money but whatever I still feel like I did I was expecting that I was gonna be able to edit my gallery but I thought wrong still the same thing Kinda sucks for me :(",
            "I love it!. Maybe add a feature where you can bind drawing tablet keys :3 with ease! Also If its possible,I wish this was available on Windows and macOS by just downloading it straight from the website and be able to link google play account or apple account or even make a IbisPaintX account so we could transfer our data either from free version or paid version of this app which I paid for xp.like being able to link our accounts somehow to those who paid for this vers. and free vers etc.",
            "I really like this app, but it's worth noting that its almost exactly the same as the free version! The only differences are that there are no ads and you dont have to watch hours of ads to unlock all the brushes. It has a lot of features, though perhaps not as many as procreate. Great app overall though 👍🏼"

        "description": "RP3 Rowing is a free application designed for the RP3 Rowing Ergo meter to run on newer Android devices. Once connected, it provides an advanced training tool that any rower or paddler can use to get real-time stroke rate, speed, distance, heart rate and other data.   \r\n\r\nThe big advantage is the real time Force Curve, which gives you a detailed feedback over your rowing stroke. Every stroke of every workout is recorded and saved for later review. Additional it can upload your workouts to the RP3 \r\nRowing Online Logbook (in a future version). You can build your own workout scheme based on \r\ntime, distance, strokes and heart rate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the data can be adjusted for boat type and weight to get the right \r\noutput, which can be compared with the boat you are rowing. This data is \r\naccurate within 0,5% to the times on water.  \r\n\r\nWith every stroke you have a choice out of 20 different data features to display. \r\nJust tap a tile and you will get a list of all the possible data, select the data you \r\nwant and it will be displayed. In this way you can build your own screen.\r\n\r\nThe workout setting is easily done by adding the different training goals you like \r\nto go for. Set a number and hit the ‘+’ button and it will be added in the workout \r\nscheme.

            "Works really well during a session and has a great UI but has some issues that desperately need fixing! One of the biggest is it often deletes workouts immediately after finishing which is very frustrating! Also it would be nice if there was some support for converting RP3 workout files to Garmin FIT files or even a way of connecting a Garmin device.  Also as a fellow developer whats with the closed source? It would be awesome if you made a Github repo so people can contribute and the app is worthless without the machine anyway so it's not like you need to worry about copyright?",

        "description": "This application is useful for those of you who want to prevent stroke\r\nHow to prevent stroke\r\n\r\nA stroke occurs when part of the brain doesn’t get enough blood. When this occurs the cells don’t get oxygen or nutrients and they die. The best way to prevent a stroke is to live a healthy lifestyle and manage any other medical conditions you might have that may increase your risks. If you or someone you are with may be experiencing a stroke, call emergency responders immediately.\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\nReducing your Risk with a Healthy Lifestyle\r\n\r\n*Eat a healthy diet*\r\nA healthy diet will help you reduce your risks of obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Each of those conditions raises your risk of having a stroke. To lower the risks of developing these conditions you can:\r\nReduce your salt intake. This will lower your risk of developing high blood pressure. You can reduce your salt consumption by not sprinkling table salt onto your food, not salting pasta or rice water, and purchasing canned foods that say low sodium. Check the ingredients in processed foods. Many have a high salt content.\r\nEat a low fat diet. A fatty diet increases your risk of clogged arteries. You can easily eat less fat by choosing lean meats like poultry and fish and trimming the fat off of red meats. Drink low fat milk or skim milk instead of whole milk. Eat eggs sparingly because they are high in cholesterol. Check foods labeled “diet” or low fat- they can surprise you with sodium and fat content!\r\nControl your caloric intake. Eating a high calorie diet places you at a higher risk for diabetes and obesity unless you are extremely physically active. Limit your intake of highly sugary foods like candies, cookies, and pastries. The processed sugar provides calories without the nutrients that will make you feel full. This can make you prone to overeating.\r\nIncrease the fruits, vegetables, and whole-grains that you eat. These foods are generally low fat and high in nutrients. They will supply you with the energy that you need without excess fat and calories.\r\n\r\n*Exercise*\r\nExercise an excellent way to reduce your risks for strokes, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Stroke Association make the following recommendations:\r\n150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Moderate physical activity includes things like power walking, biking, or doing water aerobics. This should be in addition to two days per week of weight training.\r\n75 minutes per week of intense physical activity. These activities cause you to work harder than the moderate activities. Examples include jogging, sprinting, swimming laps, and biking up hill. This should also be paired with weight training twice per week.\r\nDo three 10 minute periods of exercise per day if you do not have the time for more. This may include walking to work, walking during your lunch break, and walking home from work. The exercise doesn’t have to be done all at the same time. Bring a friend with you to make it more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThank you for using our application.\r\nDon't forget to check out our other applications.\r\nHopefully this is useful for you.",

The app is developed for the WHO epidemiological sub-region D consisting of countries Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome And Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Togo. The app underestimates the risk to some extent. It is a app for health action on the part of user. Please go through the privacy policy and documentation for understanding the implications of risk. The people are often not aware of the risk of catastrophic cardiac events and are found unprepared when such an event strikes. The doctors are usually not aware of the existence of tools to identify the risk. Others use European risk predictors as they are available online. The app informs both about the risk of fatal as well as non fatal event combined as one combined risk estimate. The app also has links to assess the risk status online for those interested in knowing the combine risk of death due to heart attack which is also known as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, CAD, CHD, coronary heart disease and also stroke which occurs due to blockade of the arteries of the brain (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of the arteries of the brain which results in a hemorrhagic stroke. The young people are less at risk compared to old people as age is a significant risk factor for development of heart attack or stroke which can result in disability and death. These conditions are very bad for the individuals suffering from stroke or heart attack also known as myocardial infarction.  These diseases are important because heart attack can lead to a variety of complications like heart failure organ failure,  erectile dysfunction dementia inability to walk pulmonary edema dilated cardiomyopathy. The sufferers of stroke also have a bad complications profile. They can develop mental derangement, speech abnormality, loss of limb function due to paralysis, loss of vision impairment of hearing impotence urinary and fecal incontinence. The app helps young people determine their risk even without spending money in an economical manner even without conducting medical tests. People can download the app and get as much information as they can get by scheduling an appointment with a trained general practitioner, cardiologist or endocrinologist. The app can help the doctors give documented proof of evidence based medicine that can be verified by the patient at their own level. The higher risk is synonymous with higher disability, higher mortality and even at time other social problems also occur. There have been cases when the disability due to paralysis or heart failure has resulted in loss of job and domestic issues like violence, divorce, promiscuity, prostitution have cropped up due to the potential risk of loss of income.  The app is for medical students, health workers, naturopaths, homeopaths, and doctors like anesthetist surgeons specialists to identify the patient with higher risk and refer the patient to cardiologist for expert consult. Mauritius has high prevalence of diabetes , hypertension and kidney disease. These disease also add to the risk subtended by being diabetic status high hba1c hypertension and smoking. The systolic blood pressure is a better marker of risk and the Mauritius has high number of hypertension patients. Mauritius also have very high number of diabetics . Increasing age of population a mixed population and very expensive life puts a special stress on an average Mauritian resulting in a high prevalence of risk factors. we sincerely hope use of this app gives a very good help to people wishing to know about their health status",

Just those two strokes make up a majority of the letters in the Roundhand Script alphabet. We'll be breaking the letters into similar groups and mastering both the lowercase and uppercase letters. \r\n\r\nCalligraphy adds creative flair to handwritten projects and, even more than being beautiful – which it definitely is, calligraphy is an analog skill that offers much needed respite in our digital world.When teacher taught her calligraphy classes at CreativeLive, she shared some essential tips and techniques all beginner calligraphers can use to improve their letter forms and calligraphy style.\r\n\r\nWhen brush lettering, make sure your downstrokes are all consistently angled. Use more pressure. The downstrokes are the thick parts of brush lettering. Making your own calligraphy guide can help with the angle a ton. You won't always need to use the calligraphy guide, but practicing with one while you're learning can help you develop the muscle memory needed to create consistent and beautiful letters in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen those skills are separate in your head and (more importantly) in your hand, you’ve mastered the basics of how to write calligraphy. That’s the essential simplicity of it.(If you're wondering how to write calligraphy with different sorts of tools such as felt-pens, square brushes etc, you might like the 'Five Options' calligraphy tutorial.If you're looking for a quick-and-easy calligraphic effect or you've hit a wall in your calligraphy practice, you might want to have a look at the page on 'easy' calligraphy.)\r\n\r\n1. Calligraphy is not as fluid as classic cursive. Each letter you write should be an individual character, so don’t try to connect them fluidly like you would, say, your signature. Try to write one cursive letter, and then pick up your pen. Start the next letter by “connecting” it to the letter before it. Practice makes perfect.\r\n2. After you’ve written and connected your letters, go back with your writing utensil and “darken” your downstrokes. So sketch over your word again, and anywhere your pen would’ve moved downward, thicken the line. Your upward strokes should remain thin.",

            "A nice, simple app that has a lot of potential. Right now the stroke recognition needs a *lot* of work, though. Sometimes a non-ubiquitous stroke order is enforced. Other times it will misidentify a stroke and (through newfound leniency?) mark some random future stroke. Other times it will flash at me telling me to make a stroke that literally has already been marked. The multi-click process for correcting the auto-grading that is often incorrect after running this gauntlet rounds out an unfortunately frustrating user experience.",
            "A well made and useful app that I use daily to retain 汉字 in memory. There are glitches though. Some stroke orders are wrong, e.g. 再 (wrt to Pleco) and certain strokes are not recognized well, like 月 in 期. I would also prefer the ability to edit lists in the app, rather than continuously importing external lists as I learn new charaters.",

        "description": "Stroke has emerged as a second biggest killer of mankind world over and even in India more people die of stroke than infectious diseases like tuberculosis. Age adjusted stroke prevalence in India ranges from 84 to 424 per 100,000 according to various studies and annual incidence ranges from 105–262/100,000. There is no data available from H.P. but it is estimated from national statistics that H.P. should have 15,000 to 20,000 patients of stroke and  every year 5000–10,000 new patients suffer stroke. This number is bound to increase with increased life expectancy and aging of population. After a stroke about 50% patients do not survive beyond 6 months and 25% become dependent for life. So not only mortality but morbidity due to stroke is also overwhelming.\r\nStroke is of two kinds: one due to rupture of brain blood vessels called hemorrhagic stroke and other is caused by blockage in brain vessels called ischemic stroke. A CT-scan of head can reliably differentiate between the two. Ischemic stroke is much more common and amounts to up to 80% of all strokes. The common symptoms of stroke are sudden appearance of: deviation of face, weakness or numbness of limbs, difficulty in speaking, unsteadiness, giddiness and headache.  The simplest way to treat ischemic stroke would be to remove the blockage in brain vessels and now the drugs are available which can dissolve the clot blocking blood vessels. However this drug which is an injection called recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(tPA) can be given within 4.5hrs of onset of stroke symptoms. Therefore it is most important that people recognize stroke symptoms at the earliest and rush to hospital with CT-Scan facility and availability of this drug.\r\nHimachal Pradesh is a small hilly state in the Northern part of India. Covering an area of 55,673 kilometres (34,594 mi), it is a mountainous state.  It has a population of 6,856,509 with population density of 123/km2, 90% of which lives in villages as per the provisional results of the Census of India 2011. It has 12 districts with population ranging from 32,000 to 1.5 crore. It has two tertiary care hospitals with four neurologists, two in each hospital. So given the difficult terrain and just four neurologists, delivering stroke treatment seemed like a distant dream.\r\nHowever in March 2014 under the guidance of Stroke Specialist Prof. M.V. Padma from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and on the initiative of Additional Chief Secretary Health to Govt. of H.P., Sh. Vineet chaudhary  a Telestroke Project was envisaged. All the government hospitals with CT-Scan facility were roped in.  Out of 17 such hospitals, eight and nine centers respectively were attached to each of the two tertiary care centers. Workshops were conducted at various district hospitals. Medical officers in these hospitals (M.B.B.S. graduates and internal Medicine postgraduates) were trained in recognizing stroke through these workshops.  They were taught reading plain CT-scan head to rule out hemorrhage even without the help of radiologist and written protocols for thrombolysis in ischemic stroke with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were provided. Blood sugar and ECG were only other investigations to be done apart from CT- head before thrombolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator was made available at all these centres and provided free of cost through hospital pharmacies. All the four neurologists were made available on phone 24x7 and whenever any ischemic stroke came in window period they were to be contacted. It was decided to use social networking sites like “Whatsapp for transmitting CT-scan images to neurologists for consultation. These hospitals were than designated as primary stroke centres.

            "Works just like Palm fast easy input I just used it to type this. If you never used a palm it will take a little practice. But I can write faster with Graffiti than I can type with my thumbs. If you swipe up on the example menu, it will show you all of the available key strokes!",
            "Pretty good app. But there are a couple issues, for one, the little menu that shows you how to write all of the letters could be better. It doesnt show any gestures like spacing, deleting, writing commas, specal symbols, and i think it should be more like the actuall palm pilot one. Overall, pretty ok app.",
            "Compared to regular Grafitti, the surface area of the writing area is much larger. I dont know whether it would be practical on a small phone. You would need to get the regular Grafitti. Grafitti is one of the great input inventions of tech. It's up there with the keyboard. It might be a little slower than gboard, but youll catch the errors faster. You can look at the words as you type, so you can correct them right away. You can look someone in the eye while you are taking notes. Fantastic.",
            "Really good implementation and loved it the way I loved it the first time in my PDAs.",
            "I like this text entry method because I learned it previously with Palm and preferred printing to a keyboard. Also it takes up less screen space than a keyboard. I wish the developers would keep it updated for newer operating systems."
