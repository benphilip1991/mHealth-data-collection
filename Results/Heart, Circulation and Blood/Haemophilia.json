            "The app is super great but there's just an improvement I would like to see. It's about the touch option on my Bluetooth earbuds, coz it has an option that touching it once either play or pause the video. The pause function is working but the play isn't. It's working on VLC but I kinda like using your app coz it's much easier when loading subtitles. I know it's really not an issue, hence rating it 5 stars coz I can just play it on my mobile but just wanted to let you know on something to improve.",
            "I have been using only MX player on my phone for years but the recent update has messed up its navigation system. Reasons: 1. A new feature has been added to seek the video by 10 secs by double click and now I'm so much used to using it for play/pause & there is absolutely no way to turn this feature off. 2. When you try to seek the video by swiping screen or even by using the forward/backward button, it doesn't move ths video according to the customized settings. I'm using it Note 9 btw",
            "Please Add Subtitles option for movies added in Mx Player. It will be good development in app to enhance user experience. Right now only online Subtitles available for playing movies from our folder. Already added Websereies and movies please enable the subtitles option. In case if I want to watch Tamil movies or kannada movies there are subtitles available. Please develop this option for MX Player.",
            "This app is awesome... I've been using this app for 2-3 years by now. The local video player is amazing and the customization is beyond amazing. But there's only one little simple problem though, that you haven't fixed yet. The brightness bar. Yeah the brightness bar you gave is 15 point bar instead of a 100. And the lowest point in the bar isnt even the dimmest brightness of the handset. Please do this one upgrade as soon as you can. And do the same for the volume bar too while youre at it plz",
            "This has been a really useful video player. I'm able to watch some of my favorite movies which I didn't get to by downloading or via Youtube. It also has a great feature of synchronisation to fix the videos which are not synced correctly. It also saves me the trouble of seeking subtitles of movies and TV shows from the browser. But I gotta say the ads are way too annoying. Whenever I open it or pause a video while the mobile data is on ads get in my way. Fix this so that I'll be glad to give 5 ⭐"

This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery. Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness. There are two main types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, which occurs due to not enough clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene.[6] Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to not enough factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to not enough factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood for its ability to clot and its levels of clotting factors.",

            "It's really worth using I've tried a hundred players to find this one. The only difficulty I experienced was with the lock screen. The app doesn't have functional consistency on the lock screen as the rest of the app. I expect the back button to make music start over when it is hit once, and go to previous music if it's hit twice. It acts differently on the lock screen and is very annoying Also the font of the tabs writings are too big and difficult to read",
            "Worked very well as far as the type of files it will play. I have a lot of music from over the years stored on various older computers and when i load those song files into this app it plays everything. I bought the upgrade because this app had exactly what i wanted. The backgrounds in the app are confusing to change be warned oooooooohhh",
            "This is the best music player I have found till date... no adds, open super fast, very easy to put music in playlists and folders. I love this music player and I am glad for the wonderful day I found it. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! Edit: I listen to subliminals and I found that I can hear even the smallest whisper which can't be heard in other music players so basically this gives crystal clear sound.",
            "Not worth the time. It made me pay ₹20 and then later realised that they have a free version with the exact same features. Also, the quality of your MP3 files doesn't improve. Use Muzio player instead. It's free and really serves the purpose.",
            "I normally don't review apps but this app does the most basic thing every music app should do, It plays music in numerical order! Otherwise, the app is basic and you can change the background to black which is great becaus the white background hurts my eyes. I 100% recommend this music player👍"

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

It needs a back button. You're on page 8. You click a link that takes you to page 290. How do you go back? Right now you must first remember that you were on page 8, then scroll all the way back. Help our users!",

Leaves a lot to be desired. It just doesn't have near as many features as audible or Rakuten kobo. I miss my sleep timer the most.",

Follow up: Ace got back to us within a couple of hours and helped us clarify our problem. It was indeed on our end. Great customer service!",

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

It's need Playit on PC, but after downloading the playit software on the computer /laptop, still the video is not playing, the same message appears. Before everything was superb, the downloaded Mp4 video were playing without any problem but since the announcement of Playit everything becomes complicated. Hope to hear any advice",

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",

Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "I remeber about 5 or so years ago this game was really differant, but don't take that the wrong way, the skins now are really cool and the map almost seems larger! The only thing I would change is to add back some of the old skins, because I thought they were fun and that way you would get more of a variety, because now there isnt as many skins as there used to be, and you have to play, ALOT to get some of the new skins, but this game is super cool and really addictive!",
            "Well, sadly, it used to be 5 stars and not loads of ads. I changed it to 3 stars after there were way too much ads and not only too much, there started to be gross, bloody, inmature ads that is not good for a kid to watch. I feel like now that I wrote a good 5 star review a few days ago about good ads, the developer thinks that I will be ok with the types of ads now. Its fine most of the time but I had to write a bad review after there was an ad that had bees stinging ladys and showing blood.",
            "This game is really good but I played it a few years ago and it was way better of course it's a good game but the skins a few years ago were better and didn't have to unlock them also I thought of was more free or something, I think that's just me though. This is a good game though and I love it ❣️",
            "I like this game . Its a wonderful game because while starting we will be small and while killing others and we will get longer and longer so I love this game .. so....…. Come on and download this game and start. Play but we cant able to play this game in online . But this is a good game to play. So… I like this game 🤗🤗🤗 and my high score is 14000. This was new. Game i was happy",
            "I love his very addictive fun exciting game, however I would of gave it a 5 if the ads where tuned down a bit, I mean too many ads and it would be better and more fun if there was only like 1 ad for 5 games, I would love it, but gotta say I love the new update.👉👈"

            "Everything's great about this game, I wanted a hack and slash rpg, I got exactly that and more. However considering all the functions of the game I dont get why it needs an active internet connection to play. Even if it does it should've been mentioned on google play just like many other games.",
            "It is an enjoyable game nice graphics and physics.my only thing would be to make the dpad floating and so can uused by either hand as I have no use of my left it would make it. Easier if all controls could be used by the right.",
            "Love the game so far,it better then alot of the game out there, but having so difficulties with the store right now it not letting me use my gold or gems. Hopefully it will be big free soon.",
            "Needs more character customization other than costumes. Graphics look like a PS2 game. Aspect ratio is messed up on my device with no option to adjust. Creature design is pretty good",

And please brings some space ship that can be buy with germs which are used to combine two spaceship in order to make new improved spaceship. I have played it and love it but most of the time events are based only on shopping like buying ship in discount or something other. You don't need to bring any events like this. Also all those things can be bring within shopping section. So please thinks about it once. Thank you.",
            "Good fun game at some point. BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",

Join me in not being paid to give a 5 star review to a company and tell how you've been taken advantage of and your time wasted.",
            "Ive played quite a bit since the plague started. I had 7 or eight ships that were upgraded in the different stats. I also had several side guns also upgraded. After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section only🤔🤔🤔🤔"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Great game, great graphic, great sound, it's good to keep your mind off things if your stress out. it also keep you relax doesn't cut out in the middle of the game. I'm less on the internet by playing this game because it's keeps my mind occupied. I reckon this is one of the second bubble games one play store app. That I would recommend to anyone that enjoy colours. some of the levels gets hard but part of the game I guess it's most enjoyable game.",
            "Fun game. Not so ridiculously hard that you feel as though you can't win without boosters, but also still challenging. Not a fan of the music, like, at all. It sounds like elevator music or the kind that you would hear while on hold on the telephone. Though, it doesn't take away from how fun this game is. The colours are awesome and the backgrounds are lovely. I also appreciate all the opportunities to earn boosters.",
            "Love this game but when you go to next level you only get half of advertizment and can't get out of game or finish the game. please fix.The game still has the same problem where i have to shut down my computer to get out of game. It is getting very frustrating. If not fixed soon i will play elsewhere.There is no back button or close button. only forsed to install a new game or shut down computer.",
            "Great in the beginning but later on if gives you NO chance to earn extra boosters which makes it almost impossible to complete. Further there all the levels looks and feels the same. One of the worst bubble games. I have deleted the app.",
            "Great game overall , but not really enjoying the new Square popping up trying to force me to agree to terms and agreements. I'm not going to agree to anything your game either needs to be readily available or start charging to play it, but I don't need to be scammed into anything just to play a mobile app and if it keeps popping up I will be uninstalling. 🤷‍♂️ Just Sayin..."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "I need my controls back. This is just getting so annoying. Ever since I made a review I've lost so much control. So f in inconsistent. Just give me control of my bike Presss the gas and no movement. Lean forward and bike keeps going backwards. So sick of spending more time fight useless controls then being competitive. Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",
            "To get bike 6 it takes for eaver if you dont play other people much it's been 3 or 3 days and I'm only at 500 it is taking too long to get another bike please fix this it is annoying",
            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

The experience is not what I'm used to, but nice to have no ads for 70c",
            "This is very disappointing to purchase. I do not understand why apps like this get high ratings. I do not like the appeal of it. I would want a repeat button to start playing the songs, but it is the shuffle button that begins the round. Also, the interface can use much improvements. Equalizer is not really the many decibels that it says. Volume is not really picking up the loudness as much as other music players. Basically, there is too much physical appearance of functionality.",
            "One of my favorite music apps and I like it better than the default samsung music app. I like the bass boost. The equalizer bands aren't accurate but this may vary from phone to phone. If I adjust a high frequency band, it will also affect the bass or vice versa. I do wish if I search up a song and play it, it would play the entire playlist instead of making a random song as last song. I have to unlock my phone to continue playing music. Not a good idea while driving.",
            "Love this app. The only improvement in my eyes would be the feature of casting to a Roku or Chromecast. I love to put it on shuffle and listen to a little of everything. I'm very eclectic when it comes to music. One minute it's Motley Crue the next it's Tupac",
            "Few months back I installed this pro version for free, it was on sale then. So for free this is very good app. But now as goggle play music is going away, I am back to this app. I can't afford yt music subscription. & Also I am offline song listening type person by filling the memory card (the old method). So this app works pretty well with me. At least there is no ad. That's great... Add some more themes like pitch black..with no gradient or texture..."

            "Its very interesting game. Also, such helpful team out there. I face some issues while playing this game and i emailed for online support. They not only solve its problem but kept follow up until i got satisfied. Its great",

            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue.

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "Don't waste your time!! Horrible app and no customer support. The app stops playing every couple of minutes, so I have to hit pause and play to restart it. The music obviously keeps playing because when it restarts its further along in the song. I emailed the developer about the issue, but never got a response. I'm deleting and moving on to something better.",
            "The only thing keeping my review from becoming 5 stars is the inability to customize the screen. Some of us don't care about a favorite track or a playlist. I utilize the folder option exclusively. I also am a huge fan of artwork, and frankly it just plain outright sucks that we don't have the option to remove icons that block or obscure the album cover. If you can fix that, I'd give you 10 stars if I could! Other than that the Pulsar Player is perfect!",
            "Another Google Play Music refugee here! This app seems to work quite well! LOVE the tag editor! Only two issues: 1.) As others have observed, some Artists/Albums split into two or more entries. 2.) I have the Bigger Bach Box in my library, and that has like 350 tracks. While editing the tags, about 50 or 60 tracks became 0KB in size. I have backups, so no worries. No doubt this was due to the insanely large number of tracks on that album.",
            "Looking for a real replacement for Google Play Music. I love that this app is ad-free, and really like the setup. And that it automatically adds album artwork! However, I use apps like this with large playlists, and when I add duplicate songs to a playlist, it adds the song. No warning that it's already been added. I don't see any option to prevent this, unless I'm missing something? Add this capability and this app would win me over.",
            "Former Google Play user, I had to use another source for my music. If you're a basic person who doesn't need the hoopla or wow factor, Pulsar is it. Easy to navigate and user friendly. I was able to easily transfer and organize my music. I'll eventually get the Pro version down the road. Good job! Thanks!"

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

Then I tried the original bank account to send money. It keep saying cannot process try later. It's been three days and still now working. What a shame. I loved this app before, now I dont. Have to find another way to send money.",
            "There isno feedback on payments and I had to exit and re-open the app to see my payment was sent. The settings suck, if something is on and you want it off, the app starts linking your accounts instead of being an off or on option. Whatever you do, don't accidentally break their rules or they will ban you for life and not give you an appeal option. The parent company will persecute you of you treat anyone the way they treat their customers.",
            "I have had venmo since they started. I have not had any issues, I use it to accept payments. It makes budgeting easier for me as I use my venmo to make misc purchases that I don't want to use for my main account. No issues for me ever. I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again. Venmo saved the day! i love this app, my favorite part is the emojis!",
            "App keeps freezing and crashing out of nowhere. It still runs fine, but at least 2 or 3 times now I've sent money to someone and the app freezes while the money is sending. Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",

It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it could be scrolling, tapping on something, etc., I have to restart the app each time.

            "Pros. Great sound. Fantastic select by artist list. Cover photos shown for each artist from stock photos on the Internet. I have a few compilations so it's a surprise to see the odd artist that I didn't realise that I had in my collection. Cons. When you create a favourate play list for example Starwars theme albums, there isn't a picture icon of the album covers on each track that's in the list so you can't see which album it is. Major inconvenience. Hope this can be fixed. Overall, great app.",
            "It's just the same as any other music player, they call it pro but sadly this one also lowers the level of volume once you turn on equalizer. Sorry but I'm tired of these things, I need a real good music player which is better than my built in music player.",
            "It's an amazing app though now when I create my own playlist and add some songs, it says 0 songs added to playlist and it adds no songs....And also the second problem is inspite of making repeat all songs on it doesn't repeat...when I play a song and it ends then it stops automatically and Doesn't get played next song.....Please solve it as soon as possible..... Also after having all this problems I am rating it with 5 stars....Thank you...",

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",

I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad.

It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "Third review: BORING. Too hard. Requires insider knowledge of how to beat each level without mistakes. Spent weeks on one level. Without insider knowledge, you must pay a LOT of money to keep going level after level, using multiple helps per level. This is an excellent way to keep people from coming back to the game. Once it becomes impossible, people simply uninstall. No other King Game is this bad.",
            "I'm giving it 1 star because you decide to remove the only task (collecting flowers), that can help us gain powerups to help us get through stages with your new update. There is no other way to get extra gold like the other games. So disappointing. I'm considering uninstalling this game. After playing after 1000 stages it is very disheartening. You promise events and none has appeared to date. You remove the only fun thing about this game. Now there is no challenge so disappointing.",
            "Hi I've been stuck on the same level for two months now. It's impossible to get through. I have used some of the resources already and nothing is happening. Game now also more for children with the bad craffics. Maybe I should just delete it. Now no more fun and freebies anymore. Get felt the same rubbish over and over. please do something.",
            "I used to absolutely love this game and have played it for years. The new update looks like actual garbage and I don't even want to play it anymore. It looks childish and I miss the beautiful graphics. I keep opening the app because I loved the game but one look at the graphics makes me close it again. This useless update made me lose all interest in playing and I will be deleting the app.",
            "The recent unavoidable mandatory update removed High Scores for no good reason, removing the very reason for even HAVING a scoring system, and thus the Point of the game, to GET Points. Do the game Programmers actually PLAY their own games, i am guessing they do not or they would know this is a big Problem. King has a habit of changing their games once they become very popular and always makes them WORSE. Why do they keep removing the one thing that made their games fun and challenging ?"

            "It's been years now since I've started using Poweramp as my primary music player, and I would say it's still the best Android music player out there. I also VERY MUCH appreciate how you added the \"Play next\" & \"Queue\" option, because before that, I thought that was the only thing this app was missing. It just makes it a lot more convenient. However, is there something I can toggle in settings that would fix the distortion whenever there's a notification or when the screen times out?",
            "At first the app couldn't find any audio files on my device, even after I went out of my way to give it explicit permission to access all files and then perform a \"full rescan.\" After reinstalling it and trying again, it worked. I wish I could sort by album artist so that artists like \"X feat. Y\" would not show up separately from \"X\". This issue makes it hard for me to sort through my library.",
            "This is the best of the best music player available for Android right now!! I have tried a variety of music players in the store, but none were upto my liking. When I listen to music, I am more concerned about the audio quality it delivers, rather than how the UI looks. This player serves both purpose by delivering a clear, balanced sound in all tones and a clean and smooth user interface. This is a must-have app for all music lovers like me.",
            "I have been using this app for years. I first downloaded it on S2 Mini running on Android Honeycomb when the rest of the world was on KitKat. I was so glad to have such a powerful app running on such an old device and the equalizer settings really helped to make the listening very delightful. Now running on S10Plus with Android 10, well its just too easy to set it up and enjoy listening to music. Thank you for making this app the best music player app I've ever used since 2015...",
            "Very nice app with amazing animations and customization. However, I HAD no idea how to add my existing playlists and there are a bunch of audio tracks that use audio from videos on my phone. These are deep in the settings app and theres no reason they should be so hard to find Theres also a ton of customization that I have no idea about and I wish I could just disable the equalizer so I stop opening it. Still an amazing app, but a couple glaring but fixable issues"

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",
        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",

Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Luv Galaga This game is awesome. I've had to figure it out all on my own. Still so many unanswered questions as to how to play the game and what everything means. And yes I've looked. I've done this fine that too. I'm thinking the game will get boring soon but ... When I played Galaga I could turn the machine over, I was a winner lol ... This one just seems too repetitive at every level. All reviews were helpful.",
            "Pay to win platform. Glitchy, and rewards not updated to recognize VIP levels. Unrealistic difficulty levels as one progresses through game. Over priced, and too many cheaters on platform. Update: cheaters are even worse, and now you can't report them. The last update made the ships weaker so you'll have to spend more money to even have a chance in campaign or pvp. The game is trash, and the developers suck.",
            "Great game. Only game that I play on my phone. But this latest update has made the game worse. In PVP i get paired to play an opponent that has lower level than me, by the time that I finish wave 1, the opponent is on wave 3. The bots are more difficult to kill for me, but the opponent still gets through waves fast. And i see he has weaker ships 🤷🏻‍♂️",
            "I have insalled 3 updates the last 3 weeks. Will not auto update even thought I have it set to do so. Two weeks in a row that it is \"Boss Friday\" and it only shows up once in a while. Missed last mini-game for unknown reasons, it just was not there. Constant issues and never get answers when I contact devs. The game is grest when it works right but that serms to be less and less causing me to lose interest.",
            "Awesome game. Killer graphics! The levels just keep getting better! Download it now! Note: Not a compensated endorsement! I'm a real person & not a not nor anything like , I don't know the devs. I'm telling you this as my own opinion."

You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",

It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",

Playback reverse or forward by horizontally sliding the finger on screen is also quite convenient. Best video player app."

Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

Other than that the game will go to 5 star if fixed... please",

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",
            "This game is so best and so cute. 😘😘. But the problem is add some more toys and the main problem is they sleep very quick and add more people. That's it to improve.

            "This app is great! Tom and his friends are soooo cute🤩 There are many surprises to discover and endless possibilities to do! The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games.

            "App is nice, but you really need to fix the wrong lyrics *problem*. Especially as you require one to actually WATCH advertising in order to not pay!! Worse, it's seemingly to be a DAILY requirement! (& I'm looking for my rusty razorblades now, I'll need them, before weeks end, to slash my wrists!) The player is great, but this quirk is more than humankind can stand, & stay sane! Thought my search for music player was over, but no. Player itself is easily worth the 5 stars. Policy not so much.",
            "Great app I found it the best player. but one thing annoying me that it would grab any video clip from any app and list it or store it or save it without permission. and it will list all the audio and video clips that I have in my mobile, thats not good. For example, sometimes I want to listen to or watch a clip in messenger or whatsapp but I don't want lark player to store it. that what needs to be corrected. restrict lark player not to list or store or save any clip unless I choose to save it",
            "please set Equalizer with 5 band mode including amplifier for right and left ear phone volume adjuster is a must as other and my inbuilt mobile music player app is provided, then only this app can be used as default in connection with Snaptube app.Try to update the above feature as I requested for users friendly and ensure from your end to make effective positively to continue to use this Lsrk music player as a default player . Reply in English only.I can not understand your language so please.",
            "It's a great app, now that Google play music is getting shut down I have moved to this app and it's great, they're is just one problem. I can't find the shuffle playlist/music button, I can only listen to the music in a specific order, if there is a shuffle play button can someone please tell me where it is and if there isn't can lark player do something about this, thanks in advance",
            "Pretty good replacement for Google Play music and it plays all my songs I have but an add to queue function would be nice if I wanted to listen to the same five songs on repeat and a way to sort music from a-z, newest to oldest or something along the lines of that would be cool too but unlike the other music apps I tried this is one of the few ones I found had widgets which I use all the time."

            "After Google Play Music got executed, I was caught off guard and had to very quickly find a new app that would perform the same way. Luckily, this music player looks, acts, and feels just like gpm! The ads in this app don't play audio over your music, rather they're just small banners at the bottom of your screen. Plays downloaded music like a dream, even allowing an in-app audio editor at no expense to the user!",
            "If you lack a decent music player, then this is definitely an excellent free one you can use. The Ads are unobtrusive, and there are no pop-ups so even without paying it's smooth and easy to use. The amount of features are more than worth the price of a very small banner ad slightly covering your browsing. Play speed and pitch shifting, recording feature, ability to cut and edit your files, and all sorts of ways to organize your music. Nothing cutting edge but a great app all around.",
            "Great app, the add is absolutely not intrusive, barely noticeable, while the appearance is almost an exact copy of the old Google Play Music app, the functionality is slightly improved on, and there's more freedom to modify songs, and sound settings easily. The ONLY thing missing is that putting songs on random doesn't actually queue a randomized list of those songs, it \"rolls\" for a new song every time, which sometimes means you hop between two songs for a while, which can be annoying.",
            "Thank you for this amazing app, though plenty of similar players to choose from, I've stopped at this one. Programs are simple & straightforward in its layout...no need to be an engineer to figure out how things work. I very much like & appreciate the large selection of the colour scheme choice! Well done and keep it up guys! 👍🤗",
            "one of the best app for listening music. I love the functionality. Qualitu of sound and everything. You will get everything releated to songs like cutter, book mark, queues, timer, recorder, duplicate finder and many more. Equaliser quality is good to go. Belive i am not a paid reviewee but i love the application heavily. I am using it for a long time almost everyday. You will not get any full screen add also, except some small banner.I am thanking the developer for making this kind of app."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I enjoy all the music that was downloaded on this app. I especially like that It has a favorites. I have them all starred. Sometimes the wrong artists appear with the music choices. I am not sure how many songs this app can hold. That would be helpful, so if I need to buy a memory card for additional storage or not. I plan on having more songs downloaded. My daughter did not complain about any problems transferring music over from one phone to the next with this app. Using app for 1 year now.",
            "for about 6 years April 2014-July 2020 this was always my go to app, I recommended it to everyone. never had issues, always worked beyond great. but lately, as of July 2020, it randomly crashes. in the middle of a song it just cuts out. thought it was just a minor issue, but it keeps getting worse, as of October 22, 2020, I'm deleting it. I love the customization, and options, but I can't listen to not even 1 full song without it cutting off, went from a 5 star rating to a 2. very disappointing",
            "It Won't add songs to Playlists. On my old cell, this app worked amazingly, I loved it. Recently I had to upgrade my phone and on my new cell I can't make playlists. The app is still great, but I need to be able to add songs to playlists. Edit: I can make Playlists now, but I gotta add the individual tracks. If you try to add a whole album to a list nothing happens. Still love the app, keep it up guys",
            "I hate the software that forces users to rate an app after its initial use. Yes, given the short time I use it its functioning well but time will til. One issue that bothers me is the player only finds items save to the hard drive, which is fine, except my drive is all but fill n I'm now saving mostly to SD card. But I can't do so n still use app. A work around need to be made. That said, everything else is okay for now."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

I don't know how to deal with this, everytime I get back to play ML my credit score is low because of the lag. Please fix this Moontoon! :'(",

So far, things are going well, minus the loading the game but. It starts to load but completely stops when loading other players. I can always exit the app out and load it back in. But by the time you do, the game started and you are behind. It's worse when you are playing Brawl. This bug really do need to be fixed.",

I tried many tricks to fix it, but didn't works at all. The only way to fix it is to download data again. Now I'm tired of downloading it again and the only choice is to uninstall it.",

It settings,it is showed that FB Lite's language is my phone's language. Another problem is it's network speed. It uses less data, this is good enough. But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",
            "My opinion about FB lite :- Mobile useres think that LITE is for only common smartphone and for those useres who have poor network. Now I am using Samsung Galaxy tripple camera phone. I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",
            "The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",
            "Good but still some bugs. Not possible to save any searches in Marketplace. Since update the search option in Marketplace doesn't work properly. When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",

When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",

I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",
            "The app is not working properly . It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly. It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly then there come 3 options:- 1. Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

I hardly could hide myself behind a recycle bin, but it smashed my bike!&quot;<br>...<br>&quot;Operator, unusual activity reported ten miles east from the town by route twenty.

No, I have no idea what the tiger was doing in Buffalo.&quot;<br>...<br>&quot;Oh my Gosh... Look there! It&#39;s a flying saucer! And it&#39;s going to land here!... Oh look!! That big thing just jumped into the sky and bit off half the saucer! Have you seen that?! Looks like a big caterpillar but has no legs!&quot;<br>...<br>&quot;Yes, mister, I heard of it.

            "No warning of updates to the app, no sign of updates in the Google Play store but as it's been reliable up until this point, went to use it in a shop and it tells me that it's unavailable due to updates. And as it's usually reliable, had no other payment method with me. Surely if there are updates that render the app unusable you would warn users? Or at least have them show up in the Google Play store so that users can schedule them?",
            "Works well most of the time. Would score higher but gets annoying when you select a particular card to pay with and the app switches to another one as you tap the reader! This has happened on a few occasions and I've had to subsequently log onto online banking to transfer money between accounts and correct the error, negating the convenience of the Gpay app! This needs to be corrected in next update please.",
            "I'm confused right now. They were some announcement in the media that GPay will be available in Romania, starting 27th of October 2020. It's strange that I could install and update GPay via Google play without getting the message \"This item is not available in your country\". But still I cannot activate my cards for in store payments. So, is GPay available in Romania? Thank you!",
            "The payment is quick and reliable. It would have been nice if it was possible to add loyalty cards that are not available, for example library cards. The user could scan a custom card and give it a name instead of relying on what's available. A lot of memberships aren't available and there is. O easy way to add them. There are third party solutions but they aren't that great.",
            "Works amazingly. However I'm guessing some banks (barclays) are belligerent and won't let their cards on it! I've used for 3 years with no issues... Then yesterday it decided to throw a wobbler and lose *all* of my card authorisations whilst I was paying for the kids to get in somewhere. I had no way of paying and my 4 banks were slow to send the authorisation pins (12hrs+)...so day out ruined. Lesson : don't rely on this absolutely. A card-in-hand is almost foolproof. An app is not."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "First of all, there are just so many damn ads. You have to see a whole lot of em. Like you get an ad after every match. Secondly, there is certain network issues with some specific opponents only. I mean like it's all going good then suddenly an opponent and it gets network and they just win it, especially if you are playing a tournament. That's really frustrating.",
            "Yet another great game ruined by greed! To the Dev...you know those adverts that keep popping up? Nobody watches them, nobody clicks on them, nobody cares about them because they are irrelevant and so out of touch. Also, why are we limited to playing only 5-6 games before we have to pay money to refill? Absolute D**k move. So why don't you just make a €2.99 one off payment option and let us enjoy your god damn game!!! I'll even put money on the fact that you won't even respond to my review 🤫",
            "This game is such a pay-to-win! It comes up to three things: pay for diamonds, buy powerups, and win matches swiftly. You can be 5 scores ahead of another player and suddenly lose the match because your opponent uses their powrups to win the game in 20 seconds! You can even pay for bigger and faster characters! The game itself was so good if both players had equal abilities in every match.",
            "Greed has ruined the game, thanks developer. This game is actually fun and exciting but there are ads after every match. It's very annoying. If you love to watch ads every 1.5 minutes of game play, you need to have this game! There are countless of \"crazy special deals\" that you can purchase at \"up to 90% off\". Just so many ways that entice players to spend spend spend!",
            "The game is getting ridicules! I believe when one click search, the game should automatically put an opponent of the same level of power! Not a ridiculously super powered opponent who you don't stand a chance against! I'm not enjoying this game any more. This issue should be fixed. Here I am writing you new update. I thought you guys have take into consideration your the reviews of your users and fixed the issue which everyone is complaining about! You guys suck. big time."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "Update: Kudos on the response, developers BUT I cannot change my rating. The adverts & rewards were many & selectable & I watched them but now, every couple of minutes a 5 second ad shows, then a popup ad, then another.... just spoils the game. I constantly viewed the ads to get the rewards but now it's just plain infuriatingly irritating. Still a great game but latest update bombards you with so many ads it completely spoils the gameplay and flow of the game. Sorry, I'm out.",
            "The best of its kind! Thank you for the support and fast response to your community. In the new arena mode how you can earn more points? What's the concept? First time got 22k high score and after that I can reach only 15k",
            "I actually like the game. It's a good shooter. My problem was that I bought gems didn't receive them. Contacted the developer twice and did get an acknowledgement let alone a response.. in the end had to seek a refund from Google. Thanks Google 👍 but shame on the developer 👎",
            "Retro vertical space shmup. If you're a fan, you might like this one. I'd recommend it as the ads haven't been oppressive and it's pretty straightforward.",
            "Love the game. It is way better and much less glitchier sluggish like some other one which I wouldnt recommend. One setting that they also remembered with these type of games with lots of flying and enemies and exploding etc, is the the one to give you a choice if you want to play with High, medium or low graphic settings. That gives you a 1 in 3 chance to play the game and not like others force you too and then its sluggish and glitchy. Well done devs. Great game."

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

Was a fun game, but w/ game set on silent & DND on, ads can blare out (ads never muted even when game is. :-( Update 6/9: Still volume issue. Getting more frustrating than fun. Update 10/15: daily bonus fails - check in same time every day - never get to day 7 award any longer. On top of incessant ads to just play, this is going on my 'only if I'm desperate & totally bored' pile. A real shame it has deteriorated to this.",
            "Can't put it down. In a week I am over level 600. Not getting any work done. Good game for waiting for someone, keeps you busy. Minimum ad's, good controls. One of the best\"bubble\" games I have played.",
            "MINUS ONE STAR!! Super KAK as the Ads take longer to play than to clear a lever and there is a damn add aver every lever. And some adds make your phone glitch so you have to exit the game and then restart again. Not worth it. And the higher the levels go the longer the adds get. STAY AWAY.. FAR FAR AWAY",

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",
            "Used to be fun and my favorite time passer. Now it's just so overwhelming buggy and full of ads. The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",
            "The ads freeze so the game must be closed and reopened. This happens after every turn and your version of ad-free is a $10/mo subscription? If there's a cheap, one-time, ad-free purchase....I'm not seeing it. Fix this please. I'd be more than willing to pay a very small one-time fee to just remove ads.",
            "I cannot view the ads to gain more coins, BUT am over run with ads after each move. Some dont finish, so close game. Have repeatedly complained to no effect. Will not buy coins for power ups! People complain about creeps lurking - don't answer them, then when finished game, block them. Turn volume off to block loud music or noise."

            "I loved this game until i hit level 1136. I had a few issues with it before this. It froze on me maybe 3 times and wouldnt give me another bird to complete a level. Other than that i truly enjoyed it. When i hit my level the screen went black. I uninstalled it. Hoping it would work again, i installed it again. The screen is still black. I will miss this game. My grandaughter and i would take turns playing it. Also love the bear that needs to be fed so you can keep playing.",
            "If you're looking for a game that's easy but still makes you feel accomplished, this is it. Scoring is arbitrary. Another great thing is that there's nothing to buy in-game. The sound effects are ASMR-worthy. Ads are short and not terribly disruptive.",
            "An amazing game. Keeps me busy when i am bored. I have finished the game and i was expecting more levels. So if there can just be more levels in the next update that would be spectacular because its an amazing game with so many suprises. 😊😊",
            "I really enjoy this game not difficult at all very good with eyes coordination when it comes to colour and your fruits It's also very good for the children to play as it keeps there mind going as well as my sister loves playing this game too. I start over each time . I complete 1600 sessions. you now have add with no X or close Have to close game and start over please fix.",
            "I loved the game it is fantastic but the problem is that out of no where the ads come and the ads does not end quickly😤 I am irritated of all this if you control the ads then I can give you all 5 stars 😒😒 but yah above all this things the levels should be harder it is very easy to earn 3 stars but yah I am not gonna delete in the hope that you will improve the levels 🙂🙂"

            "I love this game! It is so interactive. Its actually like having a pet because you have to feed it, play with it, clean it, and you have to let it sleep to get energy. I have this game on multiple devices. It is an awesome game. I really recommend it.",
            "This game is awesome in my opinion you can care for it and play games most of them take finger and hand eye coordination so if you need to practice some of the games will help you can go outside and collect food from the trees just like animal crossing",
            "I give this game 5 stars because it is super fun, easy and has so many ideas for clothing and boo games that you can unlock and enjoy plus you don't have to pay. So I will recommend this game. 😀",
            "I love this app so cute and fun but the only thing I'm having problems with is that when I try to enter my age, it does not let me continue after I have put in my age. Please help. 💙",
            "It's a great game but the amount of ads you put into the minigames now is driving me absolutely insane."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Robots game seems to not pull from yard, as much as player. Robot should not have every number to match while i'm pulling from yard. Totally different from live play. You don't give a player the exact points that the other player has like 4 or 7. Round it out nearest 5. Also when playing robot or a player the person who locks the game loses & the points goes to the opponent& that opponent goes first the next shuffle",
            "The AI like to cheat and give the player the worst hand ever. The AI had like 3 points while my team only needed 1 point to win. Ever since I had 99 points out of 100 the AI cheated and kept winning. Now I see why this game is on Google play pass because no one wants to play against cheating AI",
            "The game is designed to cheat to win, once you select the hard mode. Ive been playing dominoes too long not to know this. Theres no real online action going on. Just a computer. You guys are good!👏",
            "Probably one of the best dating apps out there. I am really happy with what the app has been offering so far. Definitely recommend this to all the single people in my life :)",
            "A few things can be changed. Often too many doubles are dealt - 4 or 5 in a hand ! Then, you miss the start of the match because of the and your first domino is played for you. You could also insist on players signing in as \"guests\" often leave when they see their tiles or have to pick from the bone yard straight away."

So you literally have to just sit there for about 1 minute everytime you play a song. So you play for like 2 min and watch an ad for 1 min.",
            "Its very cool but it has too many ads and so hard but its still alright i dont know why people rate it 1-3 if its so hard for them and it has too many ads because this game is really fun to play even its hard its still 4 stars for me its awesome and please dont hate or uninstall this game if your annoyed, also people only play this game to relax and listen to music. Also please remove some of the ads for better 👍",
            "well to start it off it was a Good looking game but when I saw it I think u could've made it without Ads but if those people out there love this game then you can keep it however you like I'm not saying you should restart the game and make it better I'm saying u can keep it however you like or want it doesn't matter but it's a nice game overall but if u don't care about this game and u think it'll get sooo much likes then u better think again but it's fine",

Only had a very short little go at playing, and that wasnt all that either. There's dozens of bubble shooters much better than this, ones where you actually get to play the game too instead of sitting thru ad after long, boring ad!!",

It's been like this for about 2 weeks. I've also uninstalled and re installed at least 3 times with no luck. Help. After reading reviews, it looks like others are having the same problem"

Create more games you only have 2. Hey Mr. Develeper can you actually listen to me because We need an update with more weapons and career. More players.",
            "Really, really good game, play it with my friends all the time. It's really fun, but I think you should add an online section that counts your points when you win against actual humans. So you should add an online where you play against other people in the world and there should be a leaderboard, can you please add this. Please. And also this game is quite smooth on all phones that are generally modern.",
            "This is amazing. I played on a friends iPad and I loved it. The simple to understand but hardish to control battle style is a blast and evens the some op weapons out. I've mained cards as it is just so much fun, want to keep enimies back? Sticky card. Want to deal damage? Explosion card. About to fall off the edge? Place swap card. Anywho this game is just amazing and good gameplay. 5/5. Simply amazing.",
            "Hello developers i hope you see this! I've been playing this game for so long and i loved it!But here's what i really want you to add in a new update:- *Online Multiplayer (upto 4 players with big maps) *Skins:like colors,hats,mask,suit,and if you could add a shop section it would be nice! *Private lobby to play with friends:-) *Make more buttons for eg:- Jump,special power,shield, etc. So,please developers notice my concerns, just a little improvement would make your game more fun. Thanks.",
            "This game, is one of the most original games based off of popular pop-culture hostory. Which is very impresive from my point of view, this game is so good, other people make games that try to live up to this standard exactly how this came to sucess.

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "I've been playing this game for over 2 years. The cash grabbing is taking it's toll and my whole alliance is ready to jump ship and find a new game. You cannot log in without a stream of advertising clicks. You can barely see your kingdom anymore because it's covered in 'click me!' ads. If I was a free to play person then I'd brush it off but I regularly pop a few dollars in so it's annoying to click off the ads at every.single.login. The core game is still good but too $$$ hungry.",
            "It's a fun game, but frequently my google play rewards money doesn't show all I have available, thus making it difficult to make in-app purchases. In fact, this problem is seriously styming my ability to advance in the game. There are packs I want to buy that have the necessary items, but I can't buy them, even though I have the funds!",
            "Played for 2 weeks to leave a fair review. this is obviously pay to win 100% (which defeats competitive play in my opinion). The multiplayer is like playing with bots and not balanced at all. The quests are super lame, the story is super lame and just thrown together, the graphics aren't exciting. The cut scenes are just slightly moving pictures with text. Would take years to get anywhere satisfactory. Absolute largest waste of time I've ever spent on anything. My first review bc of that!",
            "I truly do enjoy this game. BUT. It is 100% pay to succeed. There will be many ads and \"deals\" and \"events\" that cost money that will pop up and accost you as you log on. And every purchase, every pull is a gamble you will likely be swindled out of. I recommend playing free to play.",
            "Don't bother downloading. You need heroes to advance in the game. They disappear out your inventory list then when you do summon new ones they again don't appear in the list so you can't level up and progress. Waste of time. **was sent some summon tokens but the game still doesn't register every hereo it's just took yet another off me."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

I wish i would have found this sooner, I hand over my phone with downloaded videos and movies she loves and shortly after i hear her make noises because she has clicked the back or home button, this prevents that (as long as they are contextual buttons not physical).  It is a must have, and i have the Pro version of the app. It is my favorite and I try to watch everything that isn't Youtube with it... and honestly if I could figure out how to use it on youtube I would.",

I'd installed cause my baby cousin liked watching my cartoon movies during church but she's less than 2 & kept touching the screen causing stops & opening other apps and pushed the emergency button once and called 911. It's a waste of memory I could use for more video space",

When I came back, I had no real way of efficiently acquiring new cards as f2p and so I am stuck. My old deck was fun in standard, but can't hang in wild. I don't have enough cards to build a deck I like. I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars to be relevant. And besides, the game just keeps speeding up and power creeping its way towards MTG status. Not a fan.",
            "New battlegrounds mode made me come back after I stopped playing regularly a few years back. Was having fun but now it lags so much the timer on screen is just straight up wrong. 25 seconds left? Just kidding you're going into endgame with 3 minions and two goldens in hand, -32 rank points. Fix your game before you add new modes behind paywalls, Activision/Blizzard. There's too much competition to rest on your laurels.",

The app constantly disconnects in the middle of a game, meaning I have to close the app, reopen it and wait for the app to restart and reconnect to my game, by which point I've often lost my turn and have also missed the other players moves. Awful! It's been this way for months. Why can't you fix a simple glitch?",
            "Great game hands down, but currently a 4 star rating due to the fact that i had progressed so much further on two other accounts and i can't even log into the, the game will give me the optuon to choose my old accounts but glitch out and not load any further and keep me stuck forever. Pls help me resolve this problem and i'll gladly give my 5 star.",

There used to be an option in chromeOS to allow parallel running of tasks but now that has to be handled at the app level. you need to keep visible task running when losing focus Chromebooks are now able to run android apps so if you support Android then you pretty much support chromeOS.

If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "My previous review was a nice one with 4 stars. I always store wheel spins to use in bulk when something interesting comes in, and usually doesn't take long to get it, but I just spent 23 spins trying to get a prize that needed only 10 stars. It never took more than 10 tries. The difference now? This is the first time that I get gold coins as a prize. Talk about a weighted result huh? I don't need this. But it was an overall nice game that needs a bit balancing.",
            "Great game, needs endless mode, co-op, pvp, but I'm very pleased with the game so far, definitely could top archero if these were added along with events and other things I'm sure you have lots of plans for the game! Also please make the battle pass cheaper should be 4.99 like archero and also it should remove buff ads and other stuff. Archero also has evolve system now, need more content to keep up!",
            "1.) Archero killer? 2.) Still needs some tuning on movement/dodging. Seasoned Archero player so I have experience in this style of game. Controls just feel clunky. 3.) Reloads adds a new dimension to play by calculating your next move and making sure you have enough ammo. 4.) I would give this game a try and see for yourself.",
            "Slow, repetitive and grindy gameplay like archero. This game doesn't improve on archero. It has similar level up upgrades and similar enemies. You can play up to the desert stage and then get stuck because of low power. You have to replay the lower levels hundreds of times to try to level up and get better loot.",
            "Its a really fun game but it would be better if you could actually revive yourself after watching an add there's been quite a few times too many where I end up dying last wave or two and decide to watch an add to revive just to see my guy stand up then the game ends and I fail, if this continues ill probably delete zombero in fear of throwing my device"

I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

            "Initially the app was the best that I could ever have...but just after 1 week it turned out to be a total mess... My phone became too slow, i received the notifications too slow, i couldn't hear anything on the call and the worst was that it automatically took control over the system and modified all my settings... I wasn't able to manage any app. It was really really too disturbing and disappointing.",
            "Being able to customise the icons would be a great edition like you used to be able to do. Getting rid of the prime or making it cheaper would also be better, with no ads popping up when I turn my screen on. Icon packs and more selections of themes would be great, along with being able to customise your own themes. Oh and the icons being closer together on the home screen along with 2 more app slots added to the Dock. If these can be added then you'll definitely get more stars.",
            "In the beginning it was one of the best launcher app but now it is the only worst app. You write any complaints, except the automated, you don't receive any reply from them. For more than 3 weeks I was trying to get some \"themes\" using the app. It opens but nothing shown and nothing can be downloaded. But the \"Premium\" page and \"Wall Paper\" page are working.",
            "I love it. Thanks for this application, now my phone looks cool now. And there so many theme's you can download for free. And i'm very happy because every time i use my phone that have \"cool theme\" it will give me a nice mood so i use it everytime now. But before i didn't know this app, My phone theme is so booring that's why i didn't use it a lot. So now i'm glad that i see this application on youtube post. Thank you very much. Sorry for my english. Heheh",
            "I have had this app for years. Now all of a sudden I get a new phone and I have to pay almost a $100 a year to keep the app. I\"ll go someplace else and look for another app. As much as I love this app. and would stick with this app forever I am not gonna pay $100 a year for it. Either take leave of this issue or loose a lot of customers. There are so many free apps. Out there. We don't have to pay a yearly ot monthly fee for. I would see a 1 time charge of a few $ but thats all."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

            "Started okay but the later levels are near impossible to complete given the number of explosions on the screen when you hit a ball, can't see anything and therefore can't move out of the way quick enough. Update: Having played the game for a while longer, I'm frustrated because the follow options are not working: - Being able to select \"Extra Cannon\" in the store. When selecting it it says \"Can't connect to the store, please check your connection. My connection is fine. The other 2 options in the store take a while to activate once you enter the store: - Free Heart option by watching a video - x50 diamonds by watching a video. If these options are time delayed, it would be handy to show the countdown.",
            "Too many ads. Literally 1 after every level. Plus, the game input is laggy, so your cannon is always behind where you're touching on the screen. These people suck at making video games. I hope they die of cancer. France is the worst country in the world. Only losers live there.",
            "This app is very cool & fun to play. Very challenging. As compared to other games it contains very ads. Sounds and colours also add some spice. After if you add all of this it is the perfect game I have ever played!!!. This game is also rated for all ages which I really liked about it.",
            "This game is very addictive and all of that but I gave it 3 star because once I get out of the game and I return the next day....it begins to freeze while playing and I have to keep restarting the game every time. Up until It stops and go back to normal...but like I said this is wu-an-derful...keep it up. This thing also blacks out...and to much ads",
            "It's a very hard game but addicting at the same time, since the new updates this game has wayyyyyyyyyy to many AD's. And try to find away were we can save from where we left off if we ever decide to delete the game."

            "It is a good game but has its quirks. The bone pile is hidden during play and only visible when you draw from it. If you're not careful and hold the piece while you're placing, it, it will go to the closest matching piece. When the game is over, it covers the board so you can't review the game. Scoring is puzzling, for instance; our team score was almost 8000 and overnight dropped more than 2000 points. There is no way to remove deadbeat or caustic players from the team.",
            "Love the game, the colors and play of the game is nice. but there is an error with this app...Whenever there is a draw, the computer automatically gives the round to the opponent/computer. Also, tap-to-play causes misplays. This app can be better by:. 1) Showing how many bones are left in the boneyard. 2) allowing online play with other humans. 3) making a 3-player, and 4-player option. 4) add a carribean style play mode, where you don't win by points but after a set number of games one.",
            "Needs updates bad! The boneyard play is awful. Whether it is in my favor or not, it is ridiculous how this one pull gets the exact domino needed for an advantage, it is frustrating when you strategize to send your opponent to the yard and for them to only pull one bone nearly everytime and it's usually the exact one needed. I would be here all week describing the scenarios that I've witnessed, but overall it seems like the game leans in favor of the player of it's choice. IJS",
            "Downloaded this game as something to help me wind down (and at first it was) but, with all the updates, it's turned into a constant source of frustration. The scripting is so obvious I can guess what domino the computer will play without even seeing their dominoes. This game has gone very downhill very quickly.",
            "I've been playing this for about a year and have begun to notice that there are about 8 - 10 games that continually repeat, it's like being in \"Groundhog Day.\" I didn't notice this at first, i thought it was random shuffling, but am seeing it more frequently for the last month or so... Today the game played first, starting with a 3x6 domino, then on its second play it played a double 6! Very frustrating! The game doesn't even follow its own rules, i.e., the first player starts play with..."

            "To be honest, I love this game app and have been playing for years. Have also spent around $100 usd on cue packs. BUT..... upon connecting the game to Facebook I've lost everything. My rating # of 68, vip level 3, all the cues I've bought and won are allllll gone!!! Had the app posted a notice about this. I wouldn't have connected to Facebook.",
            "I have to admit that this is one fo the best billiard game I have played, everything about it tho are cool👌🏻but one problem is there are lots of CHEATERS!!! I had encountered so many cheaters and I did report but looks like the admins and the creator of this game isn't doing anything about these heffers being cheating. We have to play fairly, even if it's just a game but it could cause some to lose interest in the app and uninstall it. Please help solve this🤦🏻‍♀️",
            "Overall the game itself is pretty good but and this is only my opinion just a couple of niggles the way you reset the the position of the cue after every shot it's nearly always facing away from where you want to go. And you're control's for aiming and shooting is shocking trying to line up the shot you think that's it but when you move your hand away the line moves but I'm sure that this could be sorted out by you",
            "Well i thought most people reviewed that it does not have 2d camera view but it does. I just installed it and testing one opponent and it just did fine. From what i have seen so far i will rate this 4 star at the moment because the graphic and game behavour seem good to me for now and as my experience move further then i can then know how to evaluate this game.",
            "Play this game quite a bit. Great way to end the day. Its the better of the pool games that i have tryed. Note to Owner: How about some upgrades? 1. Invite friends to play 9 ball not just 8 only. 2. More emojies these are good = 😲😉😛😫🥺. 3. COOL frames for avatar, maybe animated? Add these 3 things and the game would be WAY superior to the other versions."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

            "Been using it for a long time, but then I noticed the battery drain when I got my redmi note 9 pro. Compared poco and Nova, both without any widgets, and Nova had more battery consumption. For now I'll stick to poco. Maybe when I get a new phone (or install a custom ROM) then I'm trying Nova again 😁",
            "Works like it was preinstalled smooth lots of features easy to use you would think it came with your phone if tried over 5 or more apps like me this is the last one excellent choice. 👍🏾",
            "By far one of the best launcher out there. Definitely worth a try.",
            "Used to be great but as my devices have gotten bigger I've noticed that the inability to place folder icons at the bottom of the folder is really becoming an issue, especially if using one hand. Folders are becoming useless in that regard, it's easier just to create another home screen and do your best to organize.",
            "The only flaws I see with Nova and Nova Prime are as follows: I found it hard to set up the backup and restore directories. I always feel I can't to double-check the destination. I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

I mainly didn't want to have to remember a year from now (since he prob won't like booba then) and upon opening the app it went back to the add version. Said I had to keep an active auto renewal even though I paid for a year add free.",

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "The best launcher ever, thanks a lot. I have ZenFone that I can assure you no one will buy this mobile phone! bC its launcher is the worst of all and the brand known as \"crash\". I have tried lots of launchers instead, yet I didn't experience the 'smooth' one. Your great app really follows your slogan \"smooth\", and you also fix the bugs that others was annoyed based on their comment.",
            "The newest update made it where the app is literally unusable. It crashes each time I try to make it my default homepage. I tried restarting my phone and it still won't open. Please fix this!!",
            "CRASH CRASH AND CRASH AGAIN! 🤬 I've had this app for a long while now. Used to work great. Now every damn minute or so I get the annoying app keeps closing alert. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it and even wondered my other apps maybe interfering & causing it to crash. But then I thought \"I wonder if anyone else is having the same problem\" so I come on the play store, look at the reviews and big surprise its happening to everyone. THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR LAST \"UPDATE\"! VOILA.",
            "A very good app. Everything is simple and clear. Makes it without any confusion. I have used other launcher hola launcher very similar to solo launcher for many years it was my favourite but now not existing ; better in that range one and only is the Solo launcher. But now it is crashing in REDMI NOTE 9 pro max. And Samsung also. Need to sort it out immediately. Originally I rated five Star. But continuous crashes it is down rated.",
            "It just won't stop crashing I had a layout that i loved and now its all gone because I can't use the app after the \"update\""

            "Never able to play more than 2-3 rounds. The winnings never get close to the cost of playing. First time I get a coin bonus of spin wheel. I try to play 4 cards with Max bet as it recommend. Before I even enter the bingo room. The game crashes when I come back. There's no pending game and my coins are gone! Of course nobody respond to you!",
            "I am giving it 5 stars as overall it seems like a fantastic Bingo game.. The ONE thing that I DISLIKE is not being able to add friends in the game. \"Someone sitting on a commode in the Sahara Desert could be in the fans group\". One never knows. I added friends from the fan page in another Bingo game and got hacked quite frequently. PLEASE address this. Otherwise thanks to the developers for a.great game!",
            "Would not recommend. This is a money game. You can NOT play more than a few games. The task you are ask to do are to the extreme. You can NOT progress in this game. They ask you for email to send bonuses. Which don't get. They say to like their Facebook to receive bonuses. They don't post you any. You might get two bingos a day. If you actually want to play for a bit. You have to save for over a week to do so. You are asked to add people. But you are limited to 5 gifts ever 6 hours. Rip Off!!",
            "I received 6 pop-ups in a row trying to get me to spend money on the game. 6!!! While I can understand needing money to support the game, this game is excessively bad with annoyances. Game is purposely built so you run out of chips to spend no matter the amount you bet. It's just a program that asks for your money with the facade of being a game.",
            "I really like the game ... But I am having trouble with inviting people onto the game ... It keeps sending me to some kinda mobile log in to Facebook and when I want to change password it sends it to a different fb account that I had forgotten about over ten years ago... Plus it is connected to my fb that I use now ... Could you please help"

            "Dino rampage is an amazing game. It has lovely features. Very nice game. It working very well. I like it very much",
            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

Wish I'd come across THIS app, a long time ago. Instead, my device is loaded with over a half-dozen lesser-than video apps ... taking up valuable space, and opening the list of them, every time I want to play a video. After finishing this review, I am uninstalling every one if those (now I recognize as) CLUNKERS. How wonderful to have JUST THIS ONE AMAZING VIDEO APP ON MY PHONE!!! This app automatically loads all of the videos on your device, into four (4) categories. Tap, and you instantly see/hear to BEST quality pic and sound. Once open, and one simple tap brings up the option to quickly expand/decrease the SIZE of the video to fill the whole screen ... or reduce it. Delightful -->> We also have the easy option to SAVE/SHARE every video onto Dropbox, send by gmail to our friends, ETC. You'll wish you'd discovered THIS VIDEO APP, long ago. Over the years, I've spent at least a few full days worth of HOURS, to locate/test so many others. YESH!!!!!!!!! You'll be THRILLED you've finally located the BEST.",

Then where's what's purpose of lock screen ? Developer is a dumb ass jerk I can't recommend this lousy app. its horrible app. android gets bad names due to such lousy app",

            "This MX Player app is good. But it won't read all the folders. and volume of the video's are very low. I'm disappointed, pls check and fix the issue.",

            "Yes I enjoy the relaxing game but unfortunately it is interrupted nearly every single advertisement by a still picture advertising a theatrical booking to the point that it is impossible to get rid of, ,the only way is to completely turn off my device and reboot it,,, I'm going to have to delete the game and download something else, ,it's not relaxing anymore, , it's become a chore, ,thank you",
            "So far, I love this. Easy to play,relaxing, short ads! Graphics are sharp, great levels, progressively more difficult. Especially love the little helper dragon who blasts you out of tough blockades, in fact, his little magic wand slowly refills and allows you to blast through rocks over again. This is so much more satisfying, some games arm you with the wrong color bubbles, forcing you to buy bombs. No thank you! So far this is #1 for me great job to this app maker, thank you!",
            "Would've given 5 stars but certain ads (yatze) do not let you exit the ad and continue game play. Have to exit the game and reload. Very annoying. Also, there are some disturbing ads containing sexual content. I have requested these ads be removed numerous times but they keep showing up. I will probably uninstall this app because of this even though I really enjoy playing.",

But most importantly is the fact that my family really enjoy this game which, of course, makes for a more enjoyable game night. We're looking forward to other apps by this same company.",
            "You all have way to many advertisement s and then try and force a person to spend money. Not all people that play these games gamble. This game is the first that I have seen this many advertisements. Turns a person off to something they may have really tried if it hadn't been pushed on them. I'm going to uninstall because you have turned me off to a lot of things. Thank you. Happy sailing."

The most u can win, even in 1st place, is like $450 & that's if u watch an ad. The car I have now cost me $150,000. Had 2 watch many ads lol. 😄 U can buy $$, but that's cheating.🤥 I do really like this game, but PLEASE MAKE NEW TRACKS FOR US! This GAME is 2 GREAT not 2!! MUCH LOVE & HAPPY HALLOWEEN! ☠🎃👻",
            "This game is awesome 👍😊😊. It has less ads which other game don't have. It is the best game. The only problem is that it has only 20levels and the same tracks. But it is a very good game. Thank you...🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️",

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",
            "I have always downloaded the CM Apps...Launcher, Security, Cleaner, Booster, Locker...etc Before I activate any new phone I make sure my CM Apps are in place. I have had very good results with the CM Guys and Gals and keep up the Fantastic Job !!! Colleen",
            "Terrible, terrible app. Unlock your phone and see an app. Unlock your phone to see the weather you never asked for. Whenever you plug it in to charge, it locks the phone. More of an inconvenience than useful"

            "The actual game is entertaining and fun. There is a lot more to it than I thought. The main problem I had was the lack of notch support. I am running the game on my Pixel 3XL and some of the screen is cut off. It doesn't hinder the gameplay specifically but it's hard or impossible to see the achievements that pop up for nitro boost. Overall the gameplay is fun, and I've enjoyed it.",
            "I gave this app 5 star, perhaps for the improvement to the game in betterments of graphics, more sports bikes and motoGP racing characters, make bikes' meter console little realistic. Characters needs to lean more in high speed so that it will looks so much better like a real life. Top speed and the breaks are amazing but the handling needs to improve. I think vehicles are too much on the highway. For me Maps are really good, if include isle of Man tt map this will be the best moto racing game❤️",

Why is there ads constantly after I'm done every one song? I'm kinda (I guess) confused about, why is there a lot of snowflakes in the background? Hopefully, you can fix it, or you don't, it's not my game. I guess, thanks for reading this (I guess) long review. Have a good day.",
            "The eceiprence is very terrible it was fun to test the speed with my fingers but the quilty was very terrible it sounds like the piono is catching on fire well your still trying to play it. The only other good thing about it is that it doesn't have all the ads like other piono games have. Over all it should of never been made unless they can fix everything. 😠I just wanted to download a good piono game gee.😡😠🤬😿😭😤",
            "So i just downloaded the app and its BAD.(And i mean like bad.) I dont really like it. It is slower then the og one bc i have to have the same speed as the thing app idk (Im unknown of what im saying right now btw) and it really bothers me bc of that (tbh i dont know how to explain this very well so if you dont undestand what im trying to say thats mostly your fault not mine. Sooo anyways umm yea)",

Went to the download manager, nothing downloading. Checked my videos, no videos. Went back to the browser (would be good if it remembers the last site visited) Tried another video to download. Nothing showing again, so I changed to download folder to my SD (cant create folder) I've more to add but I've maxed out the 500 characters"
