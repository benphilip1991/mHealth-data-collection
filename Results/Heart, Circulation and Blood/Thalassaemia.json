The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on how many of the four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are missing.

        "recentChanges": "Mutation 17 - The Fake News update<br>From wild conspiracy theories to election campaign mudslinging, we now live in a post-fact world where falsehoods and misinformation can spread just like a disease.<br>With help from professional fact checking organisations like &#39;Full Fact&#39; in the UK and &#39;Politifact&#39; in the USA - we&#39;ve designed a radically different scenario which lets you create your very own Fake News story and deceive the world with it.",
        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague including feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath, or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably pale. Problems with growth and development may occur in children. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Iron-deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. A poor ability to absorb iron may occur as a result of Crohn's disease or a gastric bypass. In the developing world parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by blood tests.",

            "IMO this app is head and shoulders above the rest in this category. It is extremely simple to use, very accurate and records and stores results, giving me something very meaningful to show my cardiologist. One addition I'd like to see is a small text field to allow a recording to be annotated with activity information to add important context.",
            "This app has picked up on irregularities well. And is accurate in detecting rate. But I really wish there was a way to make a note to say what was going on when I used it at that particular time. Something other than \"resting\", \"warm up\" etc. Sometimes I get palpitations and will check my rate. Would be nice to be able to add a note like \"palpitations while cooking dinner\". Then I can fill my doctor in when I see him next.",
            "Best! Ive used many... I suffer from mental and physical health issues. When my anxiety shoots up, I have to do breathing exercises, and I have to monitor my heart rate. So I know what, and when things are happ. This app really is incredible that works immidiate, and you can print/Share out your own cardiograph!!! That is huge for me I mean huge! You can go back to different dates, whatever you want to do if you're looking for something to monitor your heart rate I absolutely recommend this!",
            "clean and simple. this type of app measure bpm by colour change noted by camera. you can see how fast your heart beat by covering camera with finger and make sure flashlight on and light goes throught finger. open video camera with flashlight on. you will see slightly color change on screen with heartbeats!",
            "This does not use the flash on my phone and does not seem to take reliable measurements as compared with other similar apps. Great interface but more work needed."

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "In my opinion, this app is not worth the money for the Pro features. Only generic and limited information that one can find for free by doing a Google search on the topics. For example, the Pro feature Meal Planner is only one day's meals, unless you agree to buy another upgrade to the meal planner that costs about three times as much as you paid to unlock the Pro features. Paid to stop ads -app does not show menu to enter code - wasted that money too. More a store front than an app.",

The app has a lot of intuitive features that keep pushing me (almost unconsciously) to good, nutrient dense foods to meet those targets. Love it.",

Made it easy to correct a deficit I would never have dreamed I had. Reports are easily customized. U-tube how-to's & free webinars make it easy to learn. Gold membership is a great value.",
            "Easy fix and it's be 5! It took me 3 tried to find out why it said \"invalid data\" when I wanted to create a meal. Turns out your app doesn't allow the emoticons. I was trying to use the turkey. I like colors and images so something like that is more pleasing for me. Makes keeping track \"fun\". My planner has different colors and stickers just for support. I look at a crazy week and can smile. I'm weird. Love your app tho!!",
            "I'm finding this app so useful for tracking nutrition. I have had to go on a low carbohydrate diet and I can see at a glance the net carbs and proportions of other macros to make sure I'm on track. I also love that I can check all the vitamins and minerals as well as the foods that will supply them if any are low. Excellent 🙂",
            "Counts calories and shows key nutrients! I love how you can add your own foods and there are many preavailable to save you time. And being able to see your key nutrient daily values met is wonderful. Only thing to tweak is being able to see all your minerals you've gotten from what you ate. You can only see all the mineral percentages % from individual foods eaten. But wonderful to track calories and nutrients overall!"

            "This does exactly what is says, with zero bloat or hassle. There are simple real-time instructions on screen for how to use, and get the best and most accurate results. The app also allows you to turn on or off your flashlight simply while using the app to increase accuracy, but also warns you that depending on your phone your finger might get hot.  It does all of this with a UI that is so streamlined there is basically zero learning curve. Just install, follow the onscreen instructions and voila, Instant and accurate heart rate info.  It is simple, clean and accurate. I measured my heart rate with a blood pressure machine at a drugstore while using the app simultaneously with the other hand and it was consistently within about 5 BPM of the final output of the blood pressure machine.  After a short run the app showed my BPM increase accurately (tested with this Sony wristband thing my friend has).  Ad Free, Bloat Free, In App Purchase Free, and only asks for permission to use your camera. No other heart rate app else even comes close.",

Excellent. i don't rate many apps but this is with my time so others can experience the app that allows others away. It would be better if an audio beep was added for the heart rate but this is really good"

Also, please optimize the app properly for new versions of Android specially above 9.",

            "Good feature set, but pretty much useless for anything except tracking period and symptoms if you are not temping: even with clear cervical fluid patterns, it will not estimate when ovulation happened on a particular past month. Edit: thank you for your quick answer! Yes, I know cervical fluid is not enough information to compute the ovulation day, but I would expect a sort of estimate like \"based on your inputs, ovulation might have happened on CD x\".",

            "What a terrible app. There's more screen space dedicated to premium pushing ads than the chart! It continiously tells me I might be pregnant, even in the middle of my period (and, as someone going through fertility treatment, it's made me cry twice because the ads push that I would be pregnant if I had just bought premium), it has no algorithm to adapt to cycles and is stuck on an insane 20 day cycle, and the UI hasn't been updated since the 90s."

It is very helpful and time saving whenever yo need it.",
            "Excellent app!! Loved how efficient and helpful it is. The food suggestions are so useful. It's an all in one app that helps identify my deficiency and suggests an all natural way to correct it. Really exceptional!",
            "I love this app! I think there is more scoring emphasis on vitamin deficiency vs mineral deficiency though...I also wish there was a related app that would explain potentially why the deficiencies if you are supplementing with there already",
            "I'm quite sure that this app saved my life. For the last year and a half, my health declined to the point that I was bedridden over 95% of the time. Doctors couldn't figure it out and neither could I, despite being a scientist and reading nutritional research as a serious hobby for a couple of decades. In the app, you enter symptoms, and then it will ask a series of questions to narrow things down. This is pure genius- it asked things I had going on and would not have thought to put together. They also cut across medical specialities if the issue could include nutrients that are important for several functions. This app let me know that I was highly likely to be deficient in a particular micronutrient, and possibly a second one. The app then gives a list of foods to get that nutrient (it was only showing a list for one food per query). I went with a supplement to correct this, and within hours I started improving- not a placebo effect, swelling was going down and energy, up! In a few days I was able to do chores that I hadn't been able to do in ages. Thyroid hormone levels are recovering, too! This app is new enough that it can be a bit glitchy when you start up, and it would be nice if in the future the list of foods included how much of the nutrient each of them contain, and give a list for each nutrient identified in the report. At the moment, without that, you can at least look over the list of recommendations & that helps. I saw that I hadn't been including those foods for years (work injury destroyed income & former, more varied diet) so it seemed reasonable that I'd be depleted. It would also be a nice improvement if they were to give info on the correct form for a supplement. Though it emphasizes getting nutrition through diet, that isn't always possible, and bioavailability matters. I highly recommend this app. If you use iOS, you must wait. I tried to get it for someone else and we were unable to get it through either play store for her iPhone. I'll be doing the updates, and again must point out that as it is, this app can already be a life-saver.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I love this app. My daughter is 3 years old, immunocompromised, and is about to have her second open-heart surgery next week. This app has allowed us to track her fevers during recent illnesses and to also keep track of symptoms at the time of the temperature. When we meet or speak to the pediatrician or specialists, I have a log of all of her temperatures and symptoms. It's extremely helpful. Love this product and the app! Highly recommend Kinsa!",
            "The app and help page are well designed. Plus 1 star! However because of the price and issue I have I would avoid buying the thermometer if possible. CVS had few options, due to covid. I felt the thermometer should come with a spare battery. Worked when I first got it. Worked a 2nd time. 2 months later I try to use again. But now I only get an \"Err\" Kinsa's help page describing clearly how to remove the battery, if the Err message persists, they recommend replacing the battery (CR 2032).",
            "I'm very unhappy that this product required me to download and login to the app when the instructions indicated the device could be used \"by itself or paired to the Kinsa app\". When I initially turned it on all I could get was \"app\" which I thought meant the battery was low. But with a new battery I got the same thing \"app\". So I had no choice other than returning to Target or downloading the app and I needed to take my temp today. Our prior thermometer died.",
            "Great you can track you temperature as you take it. Only thing that i will say is you must have Bluetooth on before the thermometer will allow you to get the 3 dash to take temperature! But if Bluetooth is on and thermometer is not turning on, you must hold close to Bluetooth device to recognize it. But overall, I got it working properly and I love it! Even if you or family is sick from the flu or other sickness, that has a temperature that happens with the sickness! GREAT DEVICE!",
            "Horrible. Won't work without downloading the App. Wants your bluetooth on and location services on and know where you are. I'll be returning this piece of garbage tomorrow. I want to use it without App. Won't work without it. Instructions say it will but doesn't. Total piece of garbage"

I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",

I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",

I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",

This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

And plus the the quotes are very motivational and true. I love it! The reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is a lot of stuff not worth paying for that much for the premium thing. And I feel like there is too many features locked for premium that I can't do anything.",

In July I had saved mine as \"stressed because of school\" and now I'm happier than ever! Defo recommend 5☆ from me!",
            "Reflectly is such a great app! You can add multiple moods and activities for each day, there are also quotes, you can choose what quote style you want for different things you are struggling with or things you just need to hear. I highly recommend this app!",

And now I'm stuck on trial account, but I lost 1 months fee. I'm totally disappointed. Stupid tutorial, stupid app, stupid idea! Return my money!!!",

Especially during Covid-19, when at first I was put in an isolated room. In the end, when daddy was allowed in the room then he was in charge of recording the contractions and acutally it is sooooo nice to have these memories here.. I can actually see when IT GOT REAL 💛",

My wife is currently in labor and we've been using the app for a few hours and love the simple input and the data visualization. The intensity tracking was another pleasant surprise. Thank you so much for creating this app!!",
            "Very helpful app was fairly clear to use and helped me give the right information to my healthcare providers. I recommend checking out the settings as there is a lot more \"hidden\" to the app then what the front or dashboard shows.",
            "Simple and straightforward. It's helping me sort out my stop-and-go contractions. Thank you! I'm just not sure how to track with the \"intensity\" tab. Everything else works great.",

It probably will take you a few minutes until you know your way around the app. But we try our hardest to make it worth your while with helpful, detailed, and multifaceted insights. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them at contact@moodpatterns.info or our FB page (link in the app).\r\n Details\r\nGain insights into your feelings\r\nA mood journal or mood diary is a great way to keep a record of your feelings, but Mood Patterns can do much more for you. It is not just a mood tracker but links how you feel, to your location, company, and activity as well as to how you slept and to recent events in your life. Use it to explore the patterns in your mood.\r\nCapture how you feel in your daily life\r\nClassical diaries are great, but they have one major flaw - they are subject to recall bias. Some activities in our lives are more salient than others. We remember them better and more vividly and therefore often believe that they take a larger part of each day than they do.

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "In general this app is helpful. I have one objection - too much focus on disease! A passage that could say, \"to keep your kidneys healthy avoid theses foods\" starts out with this ramble - \"If you have bad kidneys\" \"There are many risk factors for kidney disease\" and just goes on and on planting disease, disease, disease. Do you think you could make the focus and suggestions move in the direction of healthy kidneys...?",
            "I am very disappointed with this so called app.This book really doesn't cover anything except kidney stones and that is anecdotal at best! Forget trying to find out about anything else. In an immature manner benefiting no one but a complete moron, the language of this app is degrading. The sections described only briefly the diseases. Barely covered (if at all) are various ailments of the kidneys. Even if a disease or condition is mentioned, what is said about it is minimal. This app even suggests that kidney disease can be cured which is not the case. Kidney damage is permanent and if severe enough will lead to dialysis or total kidney failure. I think I am giving this app two stars out of the kindness of my heart. I would not recommend this app to anyone except an elementary school student of middle grade.",

It's unimaginable how many people are in some state of kidney failure. We need to prevent this disease becoming our future. Start here naturally ♡",

            "I like it. I was going to delete it to be honest. But when I started to look for a replacement I couldn't find one that was any better or even as good. I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "Bad experience! The app was good at first but now it pretty much stopped being updated, for the record: as of today (13/6/2020) there are more than 18,000 cases in Israel, but the app is stuck on 17,000 still!!!! Don't download it of you wish to protect yourself somehow, because this app might even harm you due to its lack of updates since you might think that the location where you are it's safe, but in reality it might won't be becase the app didn't update to the last covid-19 number of cases",
            "It would be good if it showed everywhere in Israel where the virus exists, but it doesn't. I live near Kfar Yona where the virus was found in a student, but no dots about it. In fact, the map doesn't even show the new area of kfar yona that is already 2 or 3 years old where buildings are in isolation today. In other words, not a good app, so Lacking in correct information.",
            "Not in English, it doesn't work in England. Most probably for Israel judging by the map and possible Hebrew language?",
            "Great app given the circumstances! A few suggestions: Please create full English option as not everyone understands Hebrew well. Also, could you please include a legend; it is not clear what is difference between yellow virus and red virus. I assume blue refers to hospitals but this is also not clear. Thank you and good luck!",
            "Fantastic app. The numbers that it gives are very much updated. I downloaded my list of places and times, it is perfect: the time is given in milliseconds from 1970, the coordinates get to the exact places in Google Maps. I haven't got an alert of having been in a potentially contaminated place + time :-) ."

            "I honestly love this app. I have used in on and off for years. I recently started using this app again this year. I have been trying to register an account with Mango, but each time I try it gives me an error of \"registration unavailable\" - every time. So 4 stars. I also wish you could add your own habits to the app. Like a custom habit that you could edit, and congifure to fit your needs. I use other apps for habits I can't track in Mango. Would be nice to be able to track it all in one place.",
            "It is great for putting your meds in and keeping track with what you eat. What it does not do is take into consideration not ALL people are glued to their phones to add the information in when it wants it. Yes you can add it in later but does not give you your points. As well as not being linked to other apps like my Samsung watch which keeps track of my steps and this app does not even register 1 step and again does not give me points. How about calories since your tracking food?",
            "This is my go to app to input my health information. It would be nice if it would connect to other apps like Fitbit, Garmin, Onetouch for glucose monitor results so i only have to input in one app and Mango picks it up. Also would be nice if reminders can be adjusted based on weekdays or weekends. I wear my watch to bed to monitor sleep and my watch buzzes at 6am on weekends because I have it programmed for 6am on weekdays.",
            "This app really pushes you to take your medication and other healthy habits of your choice. I've only used this for 2 days now but I already appreciate how helpful it is. I love the leveling system and the rewards you can get the more you stay on track. A+ app in my book. :)",
            "Have not received a reminder notification for the last 4 days. All notifications are turned on and had been working, although it had been messing up randomly prior to last update. Not useful to me anymore without the reminders."

And it's very creative, when I downloaded this app there was a passcode and if you don't remember it, you may reset it by awnsering a simple question.. I do not remember what I put so I had to uninstall and reinstall but that is my fault 5/5 stars",
            "They responded to my comment VERY fast and made it so that I could use the app again! I love this app because it helps me relieve my stress and keeps me safe. I would recommend this app to anyone who struggles with the urge to self-harm because it works wonders for me. If you struggle with the urge to self-harm, PLEASE consider this app!",
            "The app has an amazing selection of helpful activities, however for some reason it struggles to load up initially, as well as loading up things like the log. I've restarted my phone, force closed the app and reopened it, my next option is reinstalling it but if that doesn't work then I'm forced to try other apps, which may not give me nearly as many options for calming myself down so I don't self harm.",
            "Hiya! I just wanna drop by and thank you for making all these mental health apps. I rarely ever see good mental health apps like this and I'm just so thankful that you guys are doing it. Self harm is a very serious struggle and I'm glad that there's more apps to help with it. I'm espically glad that you are making it free because lots of people can't pay for it and by making free, you guys are helping so many more people. Thank you for helping out and spreading more awareness!!! <3",
            "It's great but could you maybe make a 'hide' function? That would be awesome because a lot of people judge when they see apps like this on my phone. So could you maybe have an option to disguise it, like say a calculator."

For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\r\n\r\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\r\n\r\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range.

            "I love that this teaches mindful, intuitive eating and not dieting/ restricting. It really helps me to slow down and listen to my body. I am very impressed with this app! I also love the meditations 🧘‍♀️",
            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",

My baby is now a few months old and I can honestly say that there have been very few days when I haven't opened the app. The availability of advice from the pros and from other mothers is so helpful especially when you're stuck in a rut not knowing what to do/think as a parent/parent-to-be. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I'd be lost without it. Well done to the creators.",
            "This app is Brilliant! I have been suffering from morning sickness for 10 weeks now. Forever being sick. Especially in the morning! Then I downloaded this app and had a good look! It has gave me advice i haven't found else where and for the first day. I haven't been sick! I am so grateful for this app. Its videos for every week are to die for 🥰😍",
            "So I do really really like this App for get me wrong, the only thing that I feel is missing is a symptom tracker, and appointment reminders. Things that I did see other apps offer but I personally did not like the community in those apps as much as this one. So for that I give 4 stars if there as an update later on I will gladly change my review to 5 stars and will happily promote this app to my trying friends.",
            "Love this app, it has so much info to offer and it's so helpful. I'll even google questions and the answer will sometimes pop up in this app which is really beneficial. It has a great support system as well to help you along you journey. It shows you week by week how your baby is growing and just so much information I highly recommend!",
            "This is my favourite pregnancy tracker. It's like watching baby grow week to week. You can connect with other expectant moms. There are lots of helpful tips and articles on diet, relationships, and more. I have recommended it to my friends."

I just had a blood test recently that listed 17 foods that I am sensitive to, eggs, cheese, pineapple, rice as well as gluten just to name a few. I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",

Cons: If you close the app or move around in the app once your timer has started, it appears that the timer stops working. It would be useful for more detailed info on what to do (or not do) once a session has started. Would also like to be able to delete a session due to improper time recording. the app is decent - just needs some work.",

            "It is mostly convenient to enter data, but I'd like the ability to change the defaults in Settings. For instance, my smart watch measures blood pressure on my left wrist, but the default is \"right arm\". For another, the readings I take in the morning up to early afternoon are all 'Fasting', but the app tries to be helpful by suggesting an event label based on an average person's schedule.",
            "I am pre diabetic and need to regularly measure my blood sugar. I love being able to log my numbers in without having to go through a tedious menu. Its also got an alarm I can pgm to remind myself to do it. Oh, and itll show me if my numbers are \"normal\" or \"too high\". I am sure it must have a \"too low\" category, but my numbers are never that low.",
            "Very easy to use, that's main need. Can be exported but I'd prefer it to be able to be saved or backed up to my Dropbox acct. Notes aspect is confusing since it's not actually separate from the actual things you're tracking. That should be a note feature that doesn't get attached to anything. Also the food is only in grams which I'm not going to use. I will be trying other apps, but if my few needs here we're there, I'd have picked my app by now.",
            "Nice clean interface on a basic record keeping app for diabetics. Not a lot of bells and whistles. I use it for my cat's glucose and insulin. I particularly like the quick entry option by pressing + at the main menu to add a reading. It could use some improvement in terms of managing the list of medications, though. We only use one, but I still have to select it from the list each time. There's probably a file I can edit or something, but it's not spelled out anywhere I've seen.",
            "I've used this app for a number of years now. It is a great way for me to keep a record for my doctors as well as myself. Thank you! At this point, however two-years following my last review, I am a bit frustated. Again I am attempting to share my numbers with my doctor. But this time the app does not provide the BP readings for print or any other modes of transmitting; only blood glucose. I am disappointed right now!"

I want to be able to log my water intake, as well as my calories, even if there are no carbs involved. Please fix this! It is an incredible app. I can print up reports for my primary care Dr, keep track of my activities, log meals, and so much more! Thank you!",

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

I'd rate much higher than 5 stars if I could. When mental health services let me down I would credit this app with literally saving my life.",
            "Sensible and practical CBT, helps you feel better about your efforts, and gives insight.",
            "I recently came across this and I find it enjoyable and helpful. I'm not sure how I feel about the points yet, but it seems like a cool idea. I like that it has tests, organized set ups for different types of diary logs. It also gives you ideas and helpful tips. It makes it easier to decide how you're feeling and gauge how strongly you're feeling it. Lots of options and articles, and more! This is pretty cool, I'll be telling people about this app."

            "Used to be really good, but there have been a lot of ads recently that make it hard to navigate. If you can get through that, though, the app is functional and intuative. It let's you log a number of other things such as sleep, aches, etc. that allows for complex predictions. There is also a commjnity tab with a hood communtiy and many lady-related articles. Not as good as it used to be, but it still does what it's supposed to.",

            "Gets my heart rate correct and I'm able to write down how I'm feeling, what time it is, and what I was doing before I took my heart rate. Amazing app, love it. If I had to change one thing about it though I would put advice like if your heart rate is high do this... is your heart rate is low do this... but I love the app, thank you.",
            "Perhaps you've heard of the type of experiment wherein sound is reproduced by analyzing the vibrations of a bag of potato chips through a window in a silent video; that's basically why I accept that this app can work, and work well. It's in the ballpark of what a Polar H10 chest strap is telling me, and the live readout seems to correspond with what I'm feeling. I'd rate it five stars if I could save the line graph as an image. I'll change the rating if I figure it out. Good app, all told.",
            "Great app. I actually compared its Heart Rate results with a expensive BP Monitor that I have, and I was surprised to see that the Heart Rate reading was very close to the one my expensive BP monitor gave me. I recommend this app. It's a very handy thing to have on your phone when your away from home and can't take your reading with your regular medical monitor.",
            "I have a issue that specialists and doctors are finding hard to workout. This app just showed it occurring. So it does catch what heart is doing. Its not meant to diagnois but atleast you can save it and take to a professional for assessment.",
            "Not sure if the app isnt very good, or if I have a heart problem, because the app was giving me drastically different results back to back, and very up and down during test. I was consistent with testing method. Good reviews though so I'll have to test more."

        "description": "Wellcome in Apps Antibiotic Dictionary\r\n\r\nAntibiotic is an agent that weakens or destroys bacteria; antibiotics are medically used to treat various types of bacterial infections. The various types of antibiotics work either by preventing an infection from growing or by destroying an existing infection. Antibiotics are produced either from a mold or a fungus or are produced synthetically.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What are the various types of antibiotics and what do they do?\r\n\r\nCommon forms of antibiotics include aminoglycosides, macrolides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins.\r\n\r\nAminoglycosides work by interfering with the protein formation of bacteria. Aminoglycosides include gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin. Side effects can include damage to the nerves of hearing and balance, as well as kidney injury.\r\n\r\nMacrolide antibiotics interfere with the protein formation of bacteria during multiplication. Erythromycin is a macrolide. Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort.\r\n\r\nPenicillins (discovered by Sir Alexannder Fleming in 1928) work by damaging the cell walls of the invading bacteria as the bacteria reproduce. Penicillin G and V are widely used for streptococcal and other bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum penicillins, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin, are used on a variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. Hypersensitivity reactions, for example, a fever or a rash, are fairly common side effects of penicillin use. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) rarely occur, but can be life-threatening.\r\n\r\nTetracyclines, which are active against a wide range of bacteria and other organisms, are thought to prevent production of proteins in the invading bacterial cells. The tetracyclines include tetracycline and doxycycline. Side effects of therapy may include gastrointestinal irritation, sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, and liver and kidney injury. This group of drugs should not be administered during the last four to five months of pregnancy, nor should it be given to children before the age of eight years. Permanent discoloration of developing teeth may result.\r\n\r\nCephalosporins are relatively new antibiotics active against a wide range of bacteria. Like penicillins, they interfere with bacterial cell wall formation. A frequently used cephalosporin is cefaclor. Side effects include rashes and fever. Sometimes, persons allergic to penicillins will also be allergic to cephalosporins.",

It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

Uninstalled, reinstalled, every time I try to open, an error pops up \"how we feel keeps stopping\" I had started getting warning that it was causing high battery consumption so maybe for the best. Entered it faithfully for 6+ months but can't enter data when it won't open. We had a good run. galaxy S8",
            "The \"update\" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message. I've sent feedback @ least 3x, with no reply back. I've uninstalled & reinstalled, & I've shut my phone off & on, nothing helps! Something similar happened in Sept too, although when I reinstalled the App after over 100 check in's it started back over at 1 as if I was new to the site. Hopefully you'll get this taken care of ASAP or like everyone else, I'm going to have 2 uninstall.",
            "Well, it's about 7 months, and over 180 posts after my first review. The app won't open for me, it just bounces right back to the home screen. I'm sad about this, but it's been happening for a couple of weeks now. The developers should update, or fix whatever is going wrong.",
            "App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.",
            "Since the latest update, this app does not start at all,l in my Galaxy S20 Ultra... crashes immediately. Dev should ( in my opin) roll back update until a stable Android update is available if they want to keep collecting free data."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

        "description": "SlowCOVIDNC is the official COVID-19 Exposure Notification app for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). It allows users to know if they may have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result through the app. Users can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \r\n\r\nNCDHHS created this app so that North Carolinians can do their part to protect their community and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC WORKS?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Download the SlowCOVIDNC Exposure Notification app. Enable Bluetooth and Exposure notifications.\r\n\r\nStep 2: After opting-in to receive notifications, the app will generate an anonymous token for your device. A token is a string of random letters and numbers that is used to represent a phone for a short period of time. This ensures your privacy and security are protected. These individual tokens change every 10-20 minutes and are never linked to your identity or location. \r\n\r\nStep 3: Through Bluetooth, your phone and the phones around you with the SlowCOVIDNC app are working in the background (without draining your battery or data) to exchange these anonymous tokens every few minutes. As a result, devices can remember how long they are near each other. Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.\r\n\r\nStep 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. \r\n\r\nStep 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.\r\n\r\nHOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?\r\n\r\nUsing SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.\r\n\r\nBy enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. \r\n\r\nThank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC. Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19!",

Phones also record the Bluetooth signal strength of their exchanges in order to estimate how far apart they are.<br><br>Step 4: SlowCOVIDNC periodically downloads tokens from the server that have been uploaded from the devices of users who have tested positive. Your phone then uses its records of the signal strength and duration of exposures with those tokens to conduct a risk calculation and determine if you have met a threshold for notification. <br><br>Step 5: If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you may obtain your PIN from your local public health department and submit that into the app. This voluntary and anonymous reporting notifies others who have downloaded the app and may have been in close contact with you in the last 14 days that they might be at risk.<br><br>HOW SLOWCOVIDNC PROTECTS YOUR PRIVACY?<br><br>Using SlowCOVIDNC is entirely voluntary, and you can enable or disable it at any time. When using SlowCOVIDNC, your privacy will be protected. Tokens will collect and share date, time, signal strength and duration of proximity. No location data or personally identifiable data will ever be collected or stored.<br><br>By enabling Bluetooth and Exposure Notifications, you can anonymously share a positive COVID-19 test result to help slow the spread of COVID-19. You may also be notified if you have been in close contact with someone who has shared a positive COVID-19 test result.<br><br>Learn more about how your privacy is protected and our privacy policy on the NCDHHS website. <br><br>Thank you for downloading SlowCOVIDNC.

            "I downloaded this app when it first came out. Ive had no problems with it and it doesn't drain my battery. I truly wish more people would download it, just for the simple fact that it can help each other stay safe. At first I was worried that this was some type of government tracking devise, but it's not, thank God! I truly believe our NC health department is trying to help us remain healthy and I truly appreciate the effort. So far, I've not been in contact with anyone positive and Im thankful!",
            "Little to no impact on my phone performance and battery life. Appears to work as described, but many more people in North Carolina need to install this app. This app can help to slow the spread of Covid-19 by alerting you to early possible exposure to someone who tested positive. This app needs to be promoted more prominently on social media so people will know it's available. I found it by chance on the Google Play app.",
            "I installed it on my Samsung S5 (6.0.1 Marshmallow). I guess it's working, but it has a big flaw: it's a power hog. Until I installed SowCOVIDNC, my phone battery easily lasted a full day. Now I have to recharge by late-afternoon. That's a big problem. Can you please fix it? I'm not going to uninstall it, because it is important. I can live with the power drain, if I have to. But it sure would be a lot better if it didn't drain the battery so rapidly.",
            "Can't enable the app. I downloaded the app then I read how it works then I clicked enable. However it says that there's an internal error and that I should try again. I try again and it keeps saying internal error. It doesn't tell me anything what the problem is. Using a Samsung Galaxy A20 android phone. Would be thankful for any help. Will be checking back. Edit: Thank you for responding. What you told me to do helped tremendously. It works perfectly now.",
            "Excellent and Thank You! I agree with other reviewers, I hope (and will do my part) it is downloaded by as many NC residents as possible. Also - Google's category of \"Health and Fitness\" doesn't apply they need to create a specific Public Safety or Pandemic Level Category, because this app should NOT get bulked in with thousands of fitness and weight trackers and is likely getting lost in the search. Apps like this is essential to keeping us safe, it needs its own Category. Thank you again!"

            "Ok, Hi! First off, This app is just fantastic! I can always watch out where the closest drug use has been taken! I love the chemistry part and the added information of the drug! I am actually really interested in drugs (Of course I won't take any) and how it affects you mentally. Even though I am only 13 years old, I learn alot already, how a type of drug can have an effect on me. Since now it might slowly be the stage where people always take drugs, I will always have a cautious eye!",
            "I honestly think this is a great app. I have no use for it myself atm. But life is life and people will be people. This info is often hard to scrap together. Can't vouch for accuracy bc it's too far away but if credible it could be a great resource for many many people and could help lessen stigmas by even existing. I am no advocate for or against the subject of this app. But it has the potential to save many many lives. Just hope that aspect was part of the motivation for creating this. Props.",
            "The app is great for learning about all types of drugs. I like how it also lists its soures, but the app can be improved on. For example, almost every single drug I see is MDMA. Mix it up! Not every drug is MDMA. Also, it would be cool if you could go to the Substances tab and click on a substance that has a drop down on all drugs affiliated. Like if I click on Nicotine, there would be a dropdown list of all drugs containing nicotine.",
            "This is an amazing app! Very user-friendly, with a lot of important resources. I especially love the database of chemicals. Much-recommended for anyone who uses psychoactive drugs.",
            "This app is AWESOME but something I would like is to explain the difference between ways of consuming, I know there is the graph but I think that difference could be more explained and that'd be cool and really useful"

The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

            "Location services must be on for android devices to enable blue tooth, which is a huge drawback for me. I rarely have that turned on, and am selective as to when I have my cell radio on. It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...",
            "Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an 'Internal Error, please try again' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",
            "I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own? I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.",
            "While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I'm home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me.",
            "Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

            "Really like this app except that it won't let me sign in on multiple devices. I am not the only person who cares for my baby so I need my husband to also have access. I emailed about it a few days ago but haven't heard anything back...",
            "Nice app but now it is not saving my manual pumping data that I input",
            "In trying to be as objective as possible, this app is terrible. It constantly logs you out, then does not accept your password, then you must go through a reset password - all while trying to pump/breastfeed. In addition to not allowing me to log in being a reoccurring issue, I also found several times that my pump session was not stored. While its possible the first few times it could be user error, but since the early days I make it a point to talk out all the steps to make sure I've entered and saved everything correctly. I have not been able to log back in from my phone, and am now using the app through my laptop - which doesn't appear to allow you to log your pumping/breastfeeding sessions. I'm actually looking for an alternate app, because the Medela app is triggered my anxiety far too many times. At this point, my only objective with this app is to (if I'm finally able to log back in from my phone) extract my data. Obviously it cannot be a password issue on my end, if I'm able to login from my computer.",
            "**Since the update things have been going great again! Just wish there was some end user customization available to make being an EP easier. Used to be a good app, now its logged me out and saying I have connection issues which is false as I'm on my wifi now for this review. ALL of my EP sessions are logged in the app and now I can't calculate where I'm at to know what stock I have on hand and I'm hoping to stop pumping soon if I have enough.",

            "I didnt know why i couldnt gain weight since i am currently 20lbs under a healthy bmi. I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",
            "I've only started using this app but so far I'm impressed. Eating healthy and losing weight is difficult for me but this app is a great guide to track progress.",
            "So far its very easy to follow, free and provides good advice. I think if you upgrade they provide more advice."

            "I only have the free version, and I don't frequently find the need to sort by paid category, as I usually do my own research and use this as a tool to help with specific products, not as a primary search platform. It is really helpful, but I wish it had less general explanations for some ingredients. I understand it is based off the listing from the manufacturer, but some of the ingredients are under an umbrella listing rather than specifically listed. Ex. Fragrance vs Essential Oils",
            "Don't bother with this if you live outside of the USA. I live in the UK & tried to use it repeatedly. It didn't recognise any of the products I tried to scan/ stated they weren't in the database (this included products from The Body Shop. Not exactly a niche, unheard of brand). When I tried to manually enter each product (a complete ball ache) the app repeatedly crashed. Talks a lot about the FDA/ how the EU regs are better, so I suspect it would work in the US.",
            "Good tool... Things to note though: To get all the perks, you'll need to buy the add-on (i didn't and still love it); Lots of products out there haven't been rated (but you can submit them); Some ingredient ratings are confusing (ex. natural fragrance has like 100 diff. names); Look out for reviews of products before buying (just because it's a '0' on the scale doesn't mean it's the best option out there😅).",
            "Been a great app. Lots of things have been rated but also lots haven't that I have submitted. I love that I can't find a better substitute to toxic options. I tell lots of people about this app",
            "Great resource - have been able to consistently change up products I was using to healthier alternatives - it's a challenge to get your bathroom shelf rating down, but worth it! Great app."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "Good app in general, makes things easy to remember and to you can keep all of the pet's info in one place. The one thing I would love to see improved is the schedule notifications. It's confusing as you open it to confirm that you have done something (ie: given meds at the right time) but you can't click \"done\" there and then as it takes you to a future repeat instead of the one you want.",
            "I use this app to track my pets' medications and grooming. It is awesome. Also, their support staff is very responsive to feedback, and the app has only gotten better over the year or so that I have been using it.",
            "I find it very usefull and it helps me a lot not to forget the monthly medications of my dog. However, I did not find option to fill out dog's pregnancy and to set an alarm for the expected period of delivery. It would be nice to have this added as an feature.",
            "It would be great app if reminders were working. I have set medication cycles but no notification comes up when its due. I also changed it to be alarm and use system alarm, but nothing here, too. Also \"feedback and suggestions\" link is just opening sharing screen and not some contact form. Failed to upload picture from both camera or gallery, sent the error reports. Blog and Help sections are just giving me \"failed to connect wifi\" although the app is syncing without problems. (Pixel 3)",
            "What an amazing app! I've had pets for over 25 years, but on getting a new smartphone was looking for something exactly like this to keep track of things. It is feature-rich, easy to use and with great support. Thank you for developing it. 🤠 Edit... I have used this app for some months now and I've come to the conclusion that it is just far too complicated to use! Everytime I go to do something simple it is not intuitive to use."

            "I had this app years ago and it worked really well. Downloaded it last week and it seems to be a lot more troublesome now. When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

Unfortunately, the weekly graphing facility has gone haywire over the previous few months and the developer does not appear to be able to fix it. The problem appears to be that the app can only manage around about a year of data. Restricting the time frame in the filter to just under a year sorts it out.",
            "It would be great if you could add a weight tracking entry for this app. Just a place where we can enter our weight and track it with a chart.

            "The app works well as far as tracking your sugar levels etc. But, the developer is nowhere as far as customer service for answering questions about transferring records. I had to get a new phone but could not keep my records. The instructions did not work and I could not get any help whatsoever even after I paid for the premium version. The only Premium I got was a bill. So use at your risk."

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "I previously played when it was tied to Facebook. It was a good game then, but now it's a whole different game. The alliances, dragon rescue, etc. is fun. What ain't fun is the sheer number of dragons behind a pay wall (I stopped playing at the point they added legendary dragons), the amount pop ups before you can actually play the game with no way to skip all, having to click the \"feed\" button a hundred times, adds that come out of nowhere. There are a few more issues, but that's the majority.",
            "Love the game, but I hate that global chat was removed, we have chest cool downs, and I'm bombarded with ads. I used to watch ads for rewards, but these Yahoo ads are killin me. Now I'm even getting ads when I do basic things during the game, not choosing to watch the ad. Yahoo ads are annoying since I have to wait at least 50 seconds as well as periodically tap in order to finish the ad, but it was optional (watch ads for rewards). The game seems like it's dying out now..",
            "Right out the gate if you spend $30 and put it in the right area this game will be your favorite game. I truly feel that this game can be a game of the century but I don't like how everything costs so much money. if you're not careful you will nickel and dime yourself. It is an extremely fun and addictive game though and I wish they had it for console. There's a ton of variety a lot of different combinations of dragons mini games mini worlds and everything in between. Excellent game.",
            "So I love this game. I have since I was young. There are only one things I would like to address. The amount of ads u get when you first get on the game, maybe incorporate them into the game some way, but my whole family plays this also and hates the ads. Now I would like to suggest an idea. Therr should be a way to send gifts to your friends every day. Just one a day. And when u keep sending then it can increase ur friendship level and increase your rewards in ur gifts, ex. A dragon. Thank you!",
            "Love the game but as of the 4th of October, Australia started daylight savings and we accepted the fact that the event currency collection times moved from 4am, 12pm and 8pm (all EST), to 5am, 1pm and 9pm. It was an hour later, but we understood. However, recently for some reason, again the event currency collection times have shifted another hour later to, 6am, 2pm and 10pm. We are not enjoying this change and it is restricting us from getting the most out of the game. I hope it can be fixed."

With this app it is easy to make healthier and eco friendlier buying decisions. A great thank you to the developers and please continue to expand the range of articles and continue to improve this app to be compatible with future IT development.",
            "The idea is very good. There are plenty of products reviewed. I love the recommended articles written by codecheck and the fact that they contain product recommendations. Minor bugs: - It may contain misleading information due to the fact that users can upload data about various products without those being certified by a mod. - The app is laggy from time to time - The user can upvote the same comment multiple times without the option to withdraw its vote if the button was mistakenly pressed.",
            "I love this app. It really helps to find unhealthy or alarming ingredients. For example microplastic, palmoil and chemicals which can affect my health. I can only recommend it to everyone!",
            "Great app that can gives you information about variety of products (food, cosmetics) by scanning the barcode. It also highlights potentially negative ingredients (e.g. high salts)"

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

        "comments": [
            "Good start but definitely could use refinement. Easy to use and understand, even when prompted with a potential exposure. However, once exposed, there are some serious oversights. You are supposed to get tested and self-isolate based on your last possible exposure date that you determine, but the app should at least tell you what DAY you were in contact with the exposed person AND the app should reset based on 14 days of that date, NOT the date of notice. App should also have an FAQ section.",
            "The reason why I like the app, is because it is something that is benefiting society...it is a tool that's helping us. The reason why I give it 4*, is because I know there could be more work on it that can help everyone to maintain the virus. But still great job to the developers... however the app is like rock. It doesn't do anything unless who ever has the virus enters their code and means they should be quarantine. The app doesn't give out hot spots place to avoid.",
            "Huge oversight that when people are notified that they have been exposed, they are not able to find out what day they were exposed. The app collects this information and it should be shared. Msg apparently just says \"you've been exposed in the last 14 days\". Big difference if a person was exposed 1 day ago vs 14 days ago. 1 day ago, tested next day, they may not have enough virus to test positive and wrongly think they are clear. 14 days ago they can be confident in result. BIG ISSUE",
            "I want to love this App, but it is not perfect. Have had it for a while since it was introduced. Yesterday, it warned me I have been exposed, with a recommendation to get tested. Today, that same warning is completely gone and again says no exposuredetected. Thankfully reported it and spoke with Government of Canada Covid helpline, who confirmed they have received a few reports of temporary false exposure notifications and took down my details including type of phone.",
            "This app is useless. It bases it's functionality on the most unreliable technology known to man: bluetooth, it doesn't use GPS so it doesn't know where you are, can't tell you if you go to places where infected people have been, and only randomly does check to see how close your phone has been without knowing where you are. End result: went grocery shopping for 2 hours, it didn't do a single check during that time, but it did check while I was at home alone an hour prior. Totally useless, deleted."

Maybe it's because I only use it every few months or more, but it's a bit of a pain having to login every time I'm sick which doesn't happen all that often.

            "Very Informative, but maybe a little too technical, and I wouldn't say it was particularly helpful to me as a beginner who had never heard of or seen much of the items mentioned. I did like it, just couldn't find it particularly useful for me.",
            "Lots of adds. Frustratingly heaps. Some links take u to Web site for ad instead of to plant info. Alot of pics are drawn so hard to tell what it looks like in rl. Also list is Not alphabetical. Just frustrating. Sorry.",
            "I love it. Did not know the re were so many plants with healing properties.",
            "I was hugely disappointed when I had to uninstall this app before ever even opening it because my Norton antivirus identified it as a privacy risk. It monitors your location which can drain the battery and it can cause unusual behaviour from your device. So, until these things are fixed I have had to uninstall this app."

The tools the app uses to relieve anxiety are varied and appropriate to a variety of people. The app divides tools into different categories based on either active or reflective approaches, depending on a user’s preferences. All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",

            "When I run AV, it says \"risk found\". Doesn't tell me what the risk is, where it is, what to do about it. So your AV just finds the problems but doesn't do anything about them? According to the developer, it's supposed to tell you which file is affected but it has told me nothing but that a \"Risk Found\"... that's it, nothing else. Not helpful and it doesn't get rid of the problem, so the app remains useless. Still one star.",
            "AVG gives really comprehensive virus protection for free. OK there's ads which I'm prepared to put up with and actually some are interesting. AVG also offers extra protection (which isn't free) like secure VPN but the costs of the extras don't seem to be that much. There's also an AVG deep clean app which is free and that's also very good. All in all I'm very happy.",
            "All services I have ever used with AVG have run smoothly and performed as advertised and promised. I am using the free service now b/c of pandemic budget issues. I eagerly await the time that I can enjoy and feel even more secure and protected with the bundled pay services. Customer service over the years I have used AVG services has ALWAYS been warm, professional, , and acutely knowlegable about their products. Impecable service apprecited beyond compare = THANK YOU!!!",
            "One of my apps sends a PopUp with a message that my service provider UICC is not valid every 3 minutes!!! Very annoying! But otherwise, my phone works perfectly well, and nothing is wrong with the UICC. I purchased AVG antivirus pro, and AVG Cleanup, and NONE of them identified the issue nor fixed it! I am angry and i want my money back!",
            "i only got the app maybe 10 minutes ago but wow! i had some sort of malware on my phone that kept sending me to my settings and telling me to turn install on, if i did turn it on i got pop ups telling me to enter my bank details and if i tried to turn it off again i got sent to my camera, which made it almost impossible to close. anyway i got the app, did a scan and within 1 minute it found the issue and got rid of it. couldnt be happier!!!!"

        "description": "Generally speaking, the screens on smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, and other LED screens emit a blue light. This light can be harmful to your vision, especially when you expose yourself directly to it at night or when there isn't any sunlight. Bluelight Blocking is an application that helps you avoid this light by manually modifying the type of light emitted by these screens.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you have to do is adjust the transparency filters according to what you want for different occasions. The higher the filter level, the more opaque and less lit-up the screen will be, so you can read, play, or work without your eyes watering or drying out. When you want to change this value, all you have to do is slide the bar to the position that you want.\r\n\r\nThe selection of filters to choose from is enough to find the best choice for each moment: red, yellow, brown, and black are the four possibilities. When you activate one of them, you can see how the blue light becomes less harmful and easier on the eyes. You'll also be consuming less resources, so you won't burn through your battery quite as fast as long as you have Bluelight Blocking activated.\r\n\r\nTo access this application more quickly, you can set up a shortcut on the configuration menu. This way, if you want to have a shortcut to the notifications panel, you can have it display when the the filter is activated, when it's deactivated, or always. Adjust your screen and stop hurting your vision, whether it's during the day or at night.\r\n\r\nWhy should we care about blue light?\r\n\r\nBlue light is part of visible light spectrum that we are exposed to it by the sun every day. However, nighttime exposure to the light at high levels by smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other LED screens may impair your vision. \r\n\r\nIt also suppresses the production of hormone melatonin, which hinders your body's natural sleep cues.\r\n\r\nWhen your melatonin level and sleep cycle are disrupted, your risk of a wide range of ailments, from depression to cancer, may go up.\r\n\r\nYou can get help by using apps that limit the amount of blue light coming from our screens.\r\n\r\n※ When trying to download other apps you need from other than Google Play Store, sometimes they are not installed properly with the bluelight filter is activated. In such case, please turn off the bluelight filter for a moment and install other applications.\r\n\r\n※ Battery consumption is low when the filter is applied, due to low total CPU usage except for low CPU usage.",

            "This app is extremely simple to navigate with the most important information right where you need it. The system used to calculate your regular due date is incredible. (I presume it can highlight any irregularities too.) Amazing tool for finding out your date of ovulation. It doesn't include any unnecessary information and gets straight to the point, love that you can add symptoms and notes to track your overall health all month round. Great app. Well worth installation.",
            "I used to have PTracker, which offers the same pros this app does but for a membership. I can log my symptoms with this app at no cost. You can also log in all of your periods, which is a plus. If you're switching from a different period log to this one just look at your history and log your cycles in. Great app thus far!",

A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",

I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

        "description": "Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\r\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\nhttp://twilight.urbandroid.org/doc/\r\n\r\nGet more from Twilight\r\n1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading.

        "descriptionHTML": "Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?<br>Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!<br><br>Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.<br><br>The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.<br><br>In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..<br><br>The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.<br><br><br>Documentation<br>http://twilight.urbandroid.org/doc/<br><br>Get more from Twilight<br>1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading.

It allows me to play my games or read my online books to try to relax when in the midst of a migraine. Definitely the first thing I install on a new phone! Thank you so much for creating this!",
            "The first time I installed the app, I didn't understand how to manage the settings and I rushed and uninstall it. It's after some months I took out my time to carefully go through it and realized that it is one of the best screen filtering apps. I salute the developers of this app and wish you more wisdom to create more better apps for the world.",
            "Wonderful app. Easy to use. Great for those of us who get up for 30 min in middle of night before going back to sleep. Sure beats staring at ceiling for hours. The relaxing red dust storm tone is peaceful when you inevitably check your phone. Also great for going to bed as you set dimmer and brighter times. Also great for whatever went beep in the night on your phone that you don't get hit with the searchlight that iluminates your skull till your ears glow.",
            "This actually helped me go to sleep ! Im shook! My problem is...first off theres settings that im totally not comftable with nor understand. Also the whole time i was using it.. I was getting warnings of battery being used way to much & it was! Also it was using my data! To much of it! Im gonna try a different one. 😔",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years. I really like it for using my phone in the evening, and I have a small child who's often up in the night and so it's great to have the settings for nighttime use when I'm up with her. Very customisable. Highly recommend."

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

            "Very good. The only issue i have with it, is that occasionally the notifications stop. But there is a short manual on how to fix that. ( I'm just gonna write it down here for ppl who don't know where to find it) If that happens just go to the settings bar at the top left corner, then choose \"incoming messages\", and then to \" Do you receive all notifications?\". There you can find various settings and also how to enable the alarm again.",
            "Very good app, it's great at reminding me to take my meds and if I don't respond to the notification it'll notify me every 15 minutes until I do so it's a fantastic reminder. Cute themes, don't particularly enjoy the amount of adds but I don't need to open the app often so it works out.",
            "This app helped me remember my pills and track my period, but suddenoy the period tracking got blocked by a paywall, and ridiculous amount of unskippable ads started playing. My period is horribly irregular and I had the dates saved on this app, but i cant even access it anymore. Don't recommend. Gonna move to a different app.",
            "Use to work very well, then notifications stopped popping up, and even when I marked down that I took meds I wouldn't show in the app. Now there's unreasonable pop up ads with this. Kinda messy if you ask me.",
            "It is easy to use and actually works... The first app that I have used skipped the alarms so many times... And I was upset"

        "description": "Hematology, also spelled haematology, is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. \r\n\r\nThe commonest reasons for referral to the general clinic are the finding of abnormalities on the blood count or symptoms experienced by the patient that the referring doctor thinks may be caused by a disease of blood, bone marrow or sometimes the lymph nodes.\r\n\r\nThe kind of abnormalities in the blood count include the following.\r\n\r\n    Anaemia - low haemoglobin or red blood cells\r\n    Leucopenia - low white cells\r\n    Thrombocytopenia - low platelets\r\n    Polycythemia - too many red blood cells\r\n    Leucocytosis - too many white blood cells\r\n    Thrombocytosis - too many platelets\r\n\r\nMany people referred to these clinics worry that they have a cancerous illness. This will be true for some, but the majority of patients referred to the general clinic do not have cancer.\r\n\r\n Essential Haematology is widely regarded as the most authoritative introduction to the subject available, helping medical students and trainee doctors understand the essential principles of modern clinical and laboratory haematology for nearly four decades. Now in its eighth edition, this market-leading textbook introduces the formation and function of blood cells and the diseases that arise from dysfunction and disruption of these processes.\r\n\r\nBeautifully presented with over 300 stunning colour illustrations, the new edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect recent advances in knowledge of the pathogenesis of blood diseases and their diagnosis and treatment. This new text:\r\n\r\n    Describes disorders and diseases of the blood such as the various anaemias and white cell disorders, leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma, as well as bleeding and thrombotic disorders\r\n    Incorporates the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification of haematological neoplastic diseases\r\n    Reviews contemporary application of multiparameter flow cytometry, DNA sequencing and other technologies in evaluating patients with suspected haematological disease\r\n    Discusses the therapeutic use of chimeric antigen T-cells, mono- and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of intracellular signalling pathways and direct orally acting anticoagulants\r\n    Includes sections on blood transfusion and the haematological aspects of systemic diseases, pregnancy and the neonate\r\n\r\nEssential Haematology is a vital resource for all students and trainees, and a valuable reference for practicing specialists wishing to update their knowledge.\r\n\r\nHaematology discusses up-to-date knowledge of the pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, management and treatment of a wide range of blood and bone marrow disorders in a concise and user friendly style. It presents essential information for everyday use and teaching, as well more detailed scientific background for more in-depth reading, accompanied by thoughtful referencing. \r\n\r\nThe clearly illustrated full-colour figures and charts demonstrate key facts, and are supplemented by numerous high quality photomicrographs of blood cells and tissues. \r\n    New sections reflect advances in the specialty, e.g. knowledge gained from new generation sequencing, latest anticoagulant drugs, diagnostic laboratory tools, and treatment strategies\r\n    Superb four-color illustrations and photomicrographs of blood cells and tissues throughout\r\n    Companion website featuring figures and tables from the App",

            "This app hasn't been updated in over a year. A new company took over and ever since, it's been garbage and I guess the new company doesn't care about maintaining the app. This WAS the best tracking app but now it's basically useless. No one answers emails. Bet they are still getting all of that ad revenue though! 😡",
            "I have really enjoyed using this app for pregnancy prevention. I totally geek out over the graphs, cute icons, customizable colors, etc. Gone are the days of charting on paper in my little black notebook. All I have to do now is click a few buttons, add a bit of data, and the charting is done for me! You can pay to add more data, but the free version has been more than sufficient for my purposes. Thank you OvuView!",
            "Attractive design, easy to enter symptoms daily. Convenient way to chart on your phone. Love the sharing feature! I recommend interpreting the chart yourself rather than trusting the app to calculate your fertility, as some methods aren't implemented correctly. You can draw your own cover line using the \"Ovulation\" symptom. I have used this app for over a year (Symptothermal method, for observation and TTA) and am overall very happy with it.",
            "I've been using this app for years. I've had no issues and it provides all the information I need as well as lets me alter what information I would like to see. Highly recommended."

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "My tablet didn't have a filter pre-installed. This one works great and lets you adjust light/dark and hue to whats most comfortable for my eyes depending on lighting. Also it doesn't turn off or deactivate for different apps. Tried on previously that I be reading in the dark and switch to a game and bam! Blinded by bright light.",
            "I love this Bluelight Filter. It has a small footprint and gives you the the option of different colors. The widget on the screen is very handy. I take a lot of screenshots so I wish it would momentarily turn off the filter, but I guess you can't have everything.",
            "It does what it should, respects your privacy/security and is very light. This is the best blue light filter app I have found so far. It does NOT ask for a ridiculously high amount of unreasonable permissions and is really light, causing no impact on the performance of the device. Also, it has all the features needed for the job.",
            "Reduces brightness too! It lets you filter blue color and also allows you to choose other colors to dim/enhance. The best feature is how it dims the screen. I often check my clock in the middle of the night, and the low brightness allows me to go back to sleep right away! Great app, light, and you can set a timer to turn on/off.",
            "A bit iffy. The auto optiopn stops working once in a while, and I can't ever tell why. Also, there should be a true orange. Please fix the bug."

I enjoy the game the story is gokd but the only thing i don't really enjoy is trying to get you to attack other schools it goea against the story and all i usually do in theae games is try to make friends with other alliances to build up reputation. But i tried that last time i played...did not turn out as well as expected",
            "The game is great but I do have one problem. Some players are super rude and inappropriate. Can you add a report player button so that interactions can be monitored by the developers and limited to friendly?",
            "I started to play this game 3 years ago. It used to be fun and rewards from events were easy to get but not anymore. If you want to get all those stuff you gotta need to spend money. Devs keep releasing new stuff and new stuff means spending tons of money again. I honestly don't know why players still spend so big in this game when bugs are so terrible. Instead of fixing it, they are making it worse. No matter how f2p grinds all day, still not enough to keep up. Don't play this game.",
            "I have come to like the interaction between commanders. You will be surprised who just might help you. What I don't like is how the game incurage attacking other schools... That seems to be the real purpose of this game which is against the story!... And its no wonder they have to revise the cities because it gets really bad! To where no one has any compassion for their nieghboring schools."

I tried this 3 more times with the same result. Log in, go straight to test results, kicked off for alleged inactivity. Replying to your reply, this problem has not recurred after that day.",
            "When this app works it is great. However since downloading Android 11 (a few days ago) I have not been able to login and keep getting an error. Prior to the Android update the program was not reliable and would have random errors at times on different tabs. With all the great apps out there wondering why this one is so unreliable.",
            "The pharmacy part of this app is blocked by pihole which is a raspberry pi application that stops advertising over home network. This tells me that this app uses some third party advertiser to manage the pharmacy or the developers have not requested their urls to be removed from advertising block lists. Very frustrating and makes this app a little scary to use",

            "This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something. I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.",

It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

            "I love this game so much ❤❤but it really needs some upgrades like eggs and cakes and many more desserts and you should also give more utensils and dishes and a sink too like a REAL KITCHEN! !! That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",
            "It's so good I like it but the costumers is so ugly.",
            "Game keeps crashing after i play it for 1 minute",
            "It's a good game. Fun to play, interesting. Only problem is that more ingredients can be included, more cooking methods, and easier stuff. Especially issue is characters. I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

This app allows me to use my phone without adjusting my eyes, keeping my brain on the edge of sleep. Studies indicate our electronic devices disturb our circadian rhythm. But for me, my phone keeps my mind off the things that keep me awake. This app allows me to go back to sleep.",

Been using it for several years and aside from a short period where my drop menu wasn't under its fantastic spell, it is absolutely perfect. I even sprung for the Pro version to support the creators since it's been such a lifesaver.",
            "It's terrific. It does what it claims. No more tired eyes and better sleep from using it. Fantastic.",
            "Man oh man, the difference is night and day. I can read at night now in the dark and it doesn't feel like my eyes are gonna pop outta my head anymore. Taking away that blue light surely does make a difference. I don't know much about the science behind the whole blue light thing but I don't have to. The proof is how much better my eyes feel when reading with the blue light filter on. As for sleeping, I haven't noticed a big difference but I'm a bit of an insomniac, so that's that. 5 stars fosho!",
            "I still use this app even tho I think Android makes it possible to set the color now. Twilight is easy to use and gives me more control over more settings. Worth the pittance you'll pay for the Pro version."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

        "title": "Binaural Beats Therapy",
        "description": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.\r\n\r\nWhat most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAncient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process. Of course, in centuries past, societies didn’t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.\r\n\r\nWe developed this Binaural Beats app in 2010 after we’ve learned about binaural beats and used them ourselves to solve sleeping issues due to the stress of our modern busy lives, something that most of us experience today unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThrough the years we’ve received amazing feedbacks from our users, which gives us the motivation and the energy to continue to improve the app. Check out all our reviews :-)\r\n\r\nWe’ve developed different types of presets : sleep, meditation, focus & attention, faster learning, pain reduction, creativity, anxiety reduction ….\r\nIt may take some time of practice to feel the effects of binaural beats so don’t give up after your first try.\r\n\r\nWe really recommend first time users to check out our Facebook (http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK) and Google+ (http://bit.ly/FBBTGP) communities. We have a manual which explains how to use the app (volume, headphones, ...) and describe the different BB presets.

        "descriptionHTML": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.<br><br>What most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.<br><br>Ancient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process. Of course, in centuries past, societies didn’t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.<br><br>We developed this Binaural Beats app in 2010 after we’ve learned about binaural beats and used them ourselves to solve sleeping issues due to the stress of our modern busy lives, something that most of us experience today unfortunately.<br><br>Through the years we’ve received amazing feedbacks from our users, which gives us the motivation and the energy to continue to improve the app. Check out all our reviews :-)<br><br>We’ve developed different types of presets : sleep, meditation, focus &amp; attention, faster learning, pain reduction, creativity, anxiety reduction ….<br>It may take some time of practice to feel the effects of binaural beats so don’t give up after your first try.<br><br>We really recommend first time users to check out our Facebook (http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK) and Google+ (http://bit.ly/FBBTGP) communities. We have a manual which explains how to use the app (volume, headphones, ...) and describe the different BB presets.

            "Unusable. It will run for 3 minutes then stop. Unlock the screen and it resumes for another 3 minutes, then stops. All other apps closed before opening this. WiFi turned off. The only app using bluetooth to listen through earbuds. Impossible to use for the intended purpose. Update: seems only to fail on the Study program. ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",
            "I've had this app for a few years, and the Study & Learning track is very effective in helping me focus at work. HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",
            "One of the best binaural beats app. It has pre set playlist and you can layer music over it so it's still.playing in the background.",
            "I'm having the same problem as the last 2 reviews where the app binaural sound just turns off when the screen is off :( please fix it soon. Loved this app"

            "I like this game alot! Its very fun to make vlogs and other stuff. I got this app a couple days ago and I already am starting to love it! There is an issue with the ads but that doesn't really bother me alot I don't find it a problem.. you can create vlogs, dress your avatar up, make vlogs, and more! Other than the ads this game is amazing. The way that you can comment on peoples vlogs/videos is AMAZING! Its really fun how you get 10,000 subs in one day. I hope the future updates are good too!",
            "I love this game! Its amazing and has so many things that are cool! One thing that would be better is maybe if u could comment on other peoples videos just like in real life!! Other thann that there is a really good game that every one should install as soon as possible! Make sure that u dont have ads though because there are a lot of them! Makers if your reading this please cut back on all the ads they are kinda annoying and ridiculous how many there are! But overall its a really AMAZING game!!",
            "I love this game! I would give it 5 stars but there is a lot of tapping and the more videos you make the longer it lakes to make them. I wish you could comment on other people's videos and comments. You should make it so you can interact with different objects like the swimming pool and basketball hoop and maybe even control what you are doing in the videos. Like you say your going to do sports as the topic and then you try and shoot hoops for the video. I do recommend this game, it's fun!",
            "Amazing game! I love playing it. I would recommend it, has fun rewards, you can watch a stream, etc. But one thing that bugs me is when I got more then 5,000 subscribers, the box thing didn't unlock. Please fix it and I will get a 5 star rating for you.",
            "It's a pretty fun game I've been looking for something like this for a while. The reason for three stars is bc to post a video all you do is just pick a topic and done. Like you can only TALK about something not like do a challenge. I wanted to do a WoF video but you can't do that."

Draw over other apps isn't in the app settings. To turn off/snooze alarm- Bio login, screen pull down, select alarm. I use S10 & ❤ ambio. Sleep timer works great. I just want to use the alarms again, but they won't draw over the lock screen. Can y'all make that happen? I emailed but it is getting bounced back to me.",
            "I relied on this app to get me through some tough times, through several years. Unfortunately if I want to change one of the sound's volume, all of the sounds will be reset and I have to spend time resetting them all over again. And again. And again. Please fix this, I really enjoyed using this app.",
            "Not sure if this app is still in development or abandoned (not updated in 2 years), but with Android Oreo/Pie, the volume of the sounds jump up and down every couple minutes. This makes it hard to go to sleep since it's not a consistent sound.",
            "I like this app. except I'm having trouble with making my own mix. when I pick a sound it just doesn't enter. it stays blank in the new mix. I can't enter anything into it.",

And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",

            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

I use every day and I hope they'll add more productive inducing features like a calendar, daily to do list,a specific sectio, for different types of people (who is an athlete, artist, engineer, etc) And information or links that is valuable. There's so much more you guys can do. I hope you read this review. I'd be willing to pay a few dollars if this app included more. This could be the light version Also, maybe a better tutorial like or like templates , to help the user become more familiar their first time using this app. Thanks- A Real One.",
            "It's a pretty good app and it's somewhat helpful. The edit and customization abilities are OK but a bit limited. I find myself often wishing I could easily set the order in which the slides are served and I would love to be able to use animated gifs for my own custom affirmations.",

            "Been playing for awhile and got enough coins to cash out for a voucher, however everything is showing as sold out. I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore 🙃"

            "Hi, I am using this app for a time now, never had any issue and I was loving it already. Yesterday my phone updated its software and all of a sudden everything I had hidden in the app is gone. Mobile storage space isn't cleared meaning the app is still using mobile storage space but I am unable to see the videos and pics hidden in the app... Why is that? Any solution plz",
            "It's been great and all, but one of the recent updates made that double tapping zooms in COMPLETELY to pixel level instead of zooming in to a certain crop, it used to make double tapping to zoom useful for things like reading text but now double tapping is absolutely useless since it takes you down to pixel level.",
            "I have been using this app for years now. I have Android 10 and I can't open up a lot of my pictures. Please fix this . I don't know what the problem is I've even tried downloading the old version and it still won't even open up the pictures. Please fix this because I love this app.",
            "I've been using the app for over two years never had a problem, but now I updated it, the videos disappeare in my Galary for a period of time and all of sudden I see the same picz n videos back in my gallery again. Please fix it to be the way it was.",
            "Why is this app suddenly misbehaving I've been using it for years but over the few months it gets deactivated and then it doesn't give you an option of opening. An installed app that cannot be opened cos it's constantly deactivated. My premium subscription is dripping away"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

My baby doesn't realize the whole sensor under the tongue process, and the kinsa isn't smart enough to wait through his chewing or talking. An analog thermometer doesn't stop trying like the kinsa does. Really disappointed with their algorithm. The app also requires keypresses/screen-taps to start another reading, which I have to take several of to average out the noise in the kinsa (sometimes it declares his temperature much lower than it actually is because it didn't wait long enough to stabilize). I'm sure the device hardware is fine, like most other modern problems the software is the issue."

            "Brilliant for tracking alcohol consumption. Really useful graph shows how pissed you are now, and information reminds you how useless you may be at your current level. Looking at that has stopped me having one (or more) last drinks when I see the estimated time to sober. The graphic is so striking it even works when you're not sober! I think I'm talking myself into contributing for the pro version! The history graphs and stats are brilliant. Only prob is no export to CSV",
            "Can't recommend this app enough. Interface is a bit complex at first but after a small amount of time it's easy to navigate, this really helps me manage and time my drinks throughout the week, helps me see how much I'm drinking and to be consistent with measurements instead of free pouring. I'd recommend fully! I also love the live time input you can put in to really spread your drink out.",
            "On the whole, I like this app despite its dated UI. What I find really annoying however is the graph showing weekly consumption. I have four 'dry' days a week and my weekend consumption varies between 14 and 21 units. Last Friday, I consumed just 1.42 units but the graph shows 8 or thereabouts. On Saturday, 5.84 units but the graph for that day shows about 42. On Sunday, 11.4 and the graph is off the scale (over 75). Whatever logic is being applied is not user friendly.",
            "Really great app for making it easy to see how much you're drinking and sticking to a limit. My only complaint if you can call it that is I wish it had a cumulative weekly figure rather than an estimate based on previous consumption.",
            "I have used for many years and find it vey useful. Some have complained of inaccurate BAC but if I correctly set up with weight and absorbtion rate it compares very closely to two different breathalysers that I own. To start your week on a Monday, simply enter one dummy drink on a sunday. It will then start new from the next day. Only issue is that if you put a weekly limit in of 14 units and drink 4 units in one day, it shows 200% of target, however weekly & monthly figures correct over time."

            "Good white noise app. Benn using it for months and still don't know the difference between the 3 modes though! Seems to shut off if you keep using you phone for a while after turning on the noise. Don't know if that's a bug in mine or if it's designed like that. It's prefer it didn't though as often I want to keep doing stuff on my phone with the noise on to calm my baby down. Other than that - great little app.",
            "I don't really get it. There are 3 options: Night Sleep, Power Nap, Flight Sleep. When you start any of them, you hear the ocean. If you open the options, there are several other types of sounds (lake, rain, Tibetan bowls, etc.)—but choosing any of them doesn't change anything. You still just hear the ocean. An I missing something? And does it actually require headphones, or is that just a suggestion? (Who wants to wear headphones all night? How can that be comfortable?)",
            "Surprised at how effective this is. Main effect is white noise moving from left to right and back - so simplistic, it's almost silly. Other effects are automatically layered over time and change over time. Seems to work every time I need it. Only complaints are that it does not shot off when earbuds are unplugged and that there is no management available in the notifications.",
            "I find this works well for what I require, there is no one talking therefore no requirement to either get used to the voice. As I always say you have to find a voice that does it for you otherwise it won't do it for you, but I've found that this is superior Unfortunately atm it does stop for no reason before the timer runs out after about 20 minutes",
            "Love this app. It's simple and that's what makes it so appealing especially when you have to use it just before bed. I use the app mostly when I can't get to sleep easily due to stress. Works like a charm! Would definitely recommend it for it's simplicity and effectiveness."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

Only thing to say is wish for some more shades of colours, but there are already lots there, just me being picky!",

I WANT to like this app. It is a great concept but has needs in the quality aspect of the app. It needs less ads and the enlarging process causes lag and then once enlarged the pic moves too quickly and causes more glitching. For a stress relieving app it causes more stress dealing with the glitches and ads than it relieves. This app has promise if fixed. Keeping for now in hopes...",

More problems: after the above, I've tried to use the Back Arrow: Doesn't Work; had to use the Back Button on my cellphone in order to Return to the same place Initially to Select a picture & the Same thing happened over & over again & again.

Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",

Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",

All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",

            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

It gives the notification to drink water at regular intervals so that our body doesn&#39;t face water deficiency.<br><br>We look forward to welcome you here :)<br><br><br>You can also follow us on<br><br>Twitter:  https://twitter.com/7pranayama<br><br>Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/7pranayama",

            "Really very nice app.Just one change I would like to suggest if you can do.when we do Pranayam,we have to inhale and exhale from different nostrils.In our app it speaks only inhale and exhale. Just edit right or left, though it's written but while doing Pranayam ,can't see in mobile.So please do needful.Overall this is the BEST app for doing Pranayam.I suggest everyone who wants to do Pranayam at home must download this app.Thanks for making this app.",

(Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "This app is very helpful for me. I don't always think about drinking water so the alarms are very helpful. Make sure to set an alarm sound you can hear. Controls are easy. I say good job. Not very many ads either. It was free so i knew there would be some. I was pleasantly surprised that there hasn't been very many at all.",
            "This is an awesome app to track my water and I love it! The water bubble is awesome and it's definitely been motivating me. Why only 4 stars? The silly ads. Ugh!!! If I find another water app that I like without all the ads, I will definitely switch."

            "I love this app. Very easy to use and lots of options available. I only wish there were ways to customize based on preferences and food allergies so you can switch out comparable foods, or even add that. But still a great app. Love the grocery list!!",
            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",
            "I think I like the meal reminder the best then the grocery list and the variety of plans third. Been using it a long long time.",
            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

It's become to annoying, so I'm uninstalling it and may try again in the future. This issue seems only to affect the version on my phone. The version on my tablet continues to work well.",
            "I have DOWNGRADED my rating from 4* down to 3* because I am fed up with this app closing itself down. None of the rare updates have rectified this issue. In fact it has got much worse gradually over time, it now happens more frequently. When it shuts down my phones standard brightness settings reactivate which is far too bright for me. I have to stop whatever I'm doing and go into the Bluelight Filter app for it to put the filter settings back to normal. I will be looking for an alternative app.",
            "I have been looking for a blue light filter for a long time. The light on the screen has been hurting my eyes and having increasing problems with my vision. I tried many and didnt like them. Then I found this one. It is easy on my eyes and can read again. It was perfect and I didnt even need to change settings. My eyes stopped hurting. This is the best one. I wish I could put it on my laptop. I would reccomend it to everyone. It is great. Thank you for making this app."

But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",

            "Very easy to work with. You have multiple sounds and different types for each sound category, like different rainstorm sounds. Helps me sleep and I can turn off my phone and the noise still goes. Definitely recommend for ppl who need a portable white noise machine! The reason why I took 1 star off is because after a while of using it, the sound would randomly stop working in the night and I would have to back into the app to start the noise again. Other then that i love this app!",
            "Very nice app, my little son and I loved it, thanks alot :) I have a little playback timer problem though, the timer doesn't work anymore. I set the time for 30 minutes but the noise keeps on and on all night that forces me to wake up in order to turn it off. Noise used to fade out beautifully in the past but after the last update this problem appeared. I tried re-installing the app and I tried the battery optimizations thing both Watson and off, All in vane ;(. Please help",
            "Tried quite a few apps and this was our favourite. Fine tune your own custom white noise is a great feature. Simple and easy to use. Biggest feature request...Just wish I could pay to turn off ads. You can customise the background colour. Would be nice to be able to customise the icon colour also. Overall does a simple job well.",
            "The best low frequency sounds. Other apps sound higher pitched , this is the closest to a real fan ive found Edit: Still love the app, but it would be awesome if there could be a setting for volume to be independently controlled from media. If I have this running and want to watch a short video, I have to turn it off, as the app sound level is the same as the video's since they're both on the \"media\" sound level. can't make one louder without making both louder.",
            "Love that I can have this on airplane mode and on for as short or as long as I like. Love the variety of sounds, each of my children found a different sound soothing so great there is variety. This worked a treat when we were out and about in a pram, kept them asleep longer than without it. Love love love. Only downfall is not being able to use your phone for calls during its use but to me that's quite minor."

It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",

I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",

Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

        "description": "Fertility Test Analyzer is the best fertility app to help you interpret both pregnancy and ovulation test strips by giving you the % of pigmentation. It provides you with fertility charts based on your hormone levels so you can pinpoint your fertile window and track your early pregnancy days. Fertility Test Analyzer helps you get pregnant, especially if you have PCOS or irregular periods when ordinary ovulation calendars and trackers are not so helpful. It also makes you save money! Now you can buy cheap test strips in bulk knowing that you will be confident about the results once and for all!\r\n\r\nFertility Test Analyzer reads pregnancy and ovulation test strips, interprets their results and shows them in an easy and understandable way. Be reassured when reading the pigmentation level of an ovulation test or seeing a very faint line on a pregnancy test. Find out that you are pregnant before a missed period using the most sensitive tests in combination with our app. Join other pregnancy success stories! Using our  unique computer vision algorithm, Fertility Test Analyzer recognizes the pigmentation trace present in the test pad and gives you your long awaited answer.\r\n\r\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\r\n✔ Read pregnancy and ovulation test strips without any doubts.\r\n✔ Detect ovulation based on your hormone levels.\r\n✔ Predict your fertile window.\r\n✔ Improve your chances of pregnancy by better timing intercourse.\r\n✔ Check on your pregnancy initial days following your hCG evolution with its fertility charts. \r\n✔ Access your data offline and review it when Internet access is not available.\r\n✔ Keep pictures of your tests safely saved in your mobile phone.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT LIMITATIONS\r\nFertility Test Analyzer transforms qualitative data,given by the pregnancy and ovulation test strips, into quantitative data (% pigmentation). The accuracy of the numeric value is affected by a number of factors, such as: test quality, how diluted the urine is, the quality of the camera used, your skills in taking a good picture and a correct lighting. Hence, numeric results obtained cannot be taken as exact values, only a laboratory can give those.\r\nUse at your own risk. Do not use to avoid pregnancy or anything where more accuracy would be required. Please consult your healthcare provider for any health concern.\r\n\r\nAUTHORS' NOTE\r\nThe time has come to say goodbye.\r\n\r\nOver the last years we created and give support to Fertility Test Analyzer in our spare time as part of a non-profit project. Our intention was to help women to reach their dream of become mothers, and we are happy to see that it has over 70k installations at the time.\r\nSadly we have to admit that we don't have the resources to keep up on new devices and therefore we have taken the decision of release the app to the public domain under a commercial free license. We expect other fertility apps to use this technology in the near future and we think that this is the best way we have to contribute to the well being of women with fertility difficulties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we won't be giving support or maintenance to the app anymore. If you are an Android developer with some free time and want to contribute (there are a couple of things with priority if you have a modern device), the source code is on https://gitlab.com/colnix/fta.

I had a perfectly sharp image in the camera window multiple times and it kept telling me that it was a low quality image and couldn't detect the test line. It was easy to see with the naked eye even, I just wanted to save the image. I think this app needs perfect daylight, natural light to detect the lines. For the record, pregnancy tests are done first thing in the morning! For those of waking up early, that's impossible. Uninstalling.",

No. Thanks for nothing but frustration and a big let down.",
            "Should have believed all the other reviews. This app is junk. It does not pick up anything no matter what you do or how clear the image is even when it shows a visible control line in the window. Don't waste your time.",
            "Works fine when it works at all. Continue to have a very difficult time with the picture taking aspect. I understand it has to be specific to be accurate. But multiple times it has told me \"Control line not found\" but clearly marked exactly where the control line is.",
            "Takes MULTIPLE tried to capture picture. Also the test window is too far spaced and reads the pregnancy indent not the supposed second line. So give false positive reading"
