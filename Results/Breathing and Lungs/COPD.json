The term \"chronic bronchitis\" is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years. Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests.  In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.",

The app was specifically designed for clinical environments. That's why Breath Balls breathing exercises feel natural and work much better than any of the competing apps.\r\n⭐️ No quackery: Breath Ball is based on sound scientific research. New breathing exercises are added only when there is sufficient research data available.\r\nHowever, you can of course define your own breathing exercises and use Breath Ball for whatever you want.\r\n⭐️ Maximum customizability: Our well being highly depends on what we like and dislike. Breath Ball is the only app you can fully customize to your liking: Colors, breathing exercises and even the size of the user interface can be adjusted to give you the breathing app that feels just right for you.\r\n⭐️ Focus on simplicity: Breath Ball is incredibly easy to use and even the first breathing session usually leads to great results.\r\n⭐️ Free: Even the free version of Breath Ball provides all the functionality you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThese are the main reasons why leading medical professionals, therapists and biofeedback coaches use and recommend Breath Ball.\r\n\r\nWhat is Breath Ball used for?\r\nBreath Ball helps you to relieve stress and anxiety, soothe the symptoms of COPD and Asthma, lower high blood pressure and overcome sleeplessness with four easy breathing exercises.

So let's take a closer look at Breath Ball's breathing exercises and what they can do for you:\r\n\r\nBreath Ball provides breathing exercises for these four use cases:\r\n\r\n⭐️ The cardiac coherence breathing exercise is used to relieve stress and anxiety. It is thought to patients at rehab and bio-feedback trainings to help them get calm and relax.\r\n\r\n⭐️ The COPD foundation’s recommended breathing technique helps to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of Asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Slow paced breathing is a complementary treatment against hypertension (high blood pressure). It goes back to Prof. Dr. Loew and is commonly used in clinical environments.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Dr. Andrew Weil’s famous 4:7:8 breathing technique is used to get calm to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nEach of these breathing exercises comes with a short tutorial that will get you started in less than two minutes.

I find it helpful and I think it has a great Foundation to be a frontrunner. I specifically like the breathing bar although only comes with premium. I like being able to change the colors making it easier on my eyes and less stressful to use. I also like the defined breathing exercises for Sleep stress COPD excetera. But the app needs work.",
            "Awesome customisable app,only thing missing is dark mode and import own background sounds in case one doesn't like the ones there/for variety.Maybe the white screen should have some pastel colours with shades changing as the ball moves? Upon completion of a longer time maybe an encouraging message like \"well done or you've improved \" to encourage people to return to the app? So good I recommended it to a friend who enjoys it :D thank you so much makers of this app !!😊 No account needed,yay !",
            "This app has potential, but presently has annoying glitches: 1) has several audible glitches in the audio (inhale and exhale cues), 2) no delayed start is available, 3) always asks confirmation before exiting (it should not do this unkess you are in the middle of a session. It should also provide the option to turn this confirmation off.)",
            "Visual of ball and adjustment of timing is great. But the audio glitches that make a crackling sound every time the audio cue happens makes this app unusable with the sound on. Yes, you can just turn the audio guide off, but the audio guide, without the glitches, would really add to the meditative experience and would allow you to not have to be looking at the ball 100% of the time."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a common preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients.\r\n\r\nThere are several features of \"Respiratory COPD Exacerbation - BAP-65 Score\", namely:\r\n🔸 Simple and very easy to use COPD app.\r\n🔸 Precise calculation with BAP-65 score.\r\n🔸 Assess severity and predict outcome of acute COPD exacerbation.\r\n🔸 It is totally free. Download now!\r\n\r\nBAP-65 score in \"Respiratory COPD Exacerbation - BAP-65 Score\" app correlates well with both in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD. The BAP-65 system is a score composed of 4 variables. All of them are available upon presentation to the hospital. The B letter stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and it is positive if level is above 25 mg/dL. The A letter stands for Altered Mental Status and it is counted positive when the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 14 or less, or when the physician has designated that the patient was disoriented, stuporous or in coma. The P letter stands for Pulse and it is positive when the initial pulse is above 109 beats/min. Finally, an additional point will be added if the patient was above 65 years old. \r\n \r\nDisclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment.

Adding entries to my records and when I look in the daily report section what is displayed or not displayed on any given record keeps changing, lines of info just disappear. Yes, I'm saving them each time. It's very frustrating as the long term picture is what I'm interested in most, and being able to share accurate records with my doctor. Added medications frequently disappear from the list too. I'll try a few more days but also look for a more reliable app.",

Take 4 more for other things. Not sure I see the point at all of doing daily logs anyhow! Now also blocked notifications as fed up with being told to say how I feel. Don't like so many aspects of this app. Also can't link my diabetes blue tooth monitor or my blood pressure blue tooth device.",

This is a set of diseases where the flow of air in the lungs is obstructed. Emphysemia is most often caused by smoking but can be caused by other diseases or have no known cause at all.\r\nIt occurs when the very small air sacs (called the alveoli) at the ends of the airways in the lungs start to break down from many sacs to form much bigger sacs. The alveoli are the areas of the lung where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged into and out of the blood. Emphysema makes it hard for people to blow air out of the lungs because air gets trapped inside the broken alveoli due to the collapse of the walls.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Emphysema Guide, Emphysema Disease Management & Emphysema Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Emphysema Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "Very handy app for tracking how your asthma is doing and especially handy at the moment as in the UK asthma check ups are over the phone so with this app I am able to tell the nurse my readings over a period rather than taking one reading on the day I am seeing her. It is also handy for seeing if your asthma has a pattern (my asthma is not as good in the winter). It's great to start to see a visual improvement when you are feeling a bit better after a bad spell.",
            "Simple to use, and really good. It would be useful if the data could be automatically backed up to the cloud (eg Google Drive is or Dropbox or whatever)",
            "Charts are totally off compared with my daughters peak flow monitor. Her peak flow device registers as red up to 120, yellow up to 180 and green is over 200. On this app, green shows much lower so her readings are showing as green when they're actually in the red.",
            "Perfect app for saving and monitoring your peak flow values like if you have asthma. Does everything you could possibly want in an app like this. And it's really simple to use.",
            "very useful, only problem set points for yellow & red zones can't be altered, and are in the wrong place for me. I have action plan from Asthma clinic with the values listed. Response:- Overall very good app, I have tried altering personal best but still can't get zones to match my Asthma plan. small problem though."

The design of this feature emphasized ease of use and interactive user interface principles. The “Learn COPD” feature includes information about the lung and COPD impact in general.\r\n\r\nSmoking Cessation:\r\nSmoking cessation feature helps patients with text awareness nonfictions. MyLung app asks patients to assess the smoking consumption level and to measures their ability to quit smoking by completing a questionnaire. Based on the questionnaire answers, smoking patients will receive personalized motivational messages.\r\n\r\nOutdoor Pollution:\r\nThis feature raises awareness about the risk of outdoor pollution. Breathing clean air is essential to maintain healthy lifestyle. With this feature, patients will be receiving notifications about pollution level based on their current geolocation. The information of the air index will be provided from World Air Quality Index AQI API.  \r\n\r\nMonitoring Feature:\r\nThis feature allows patients to self-monitor their symptoms and daily activities. The COPD symptoms will be entered as scale measurements using a short Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). CCQ measures health status and assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with COPD. The CCQ is a 10-item that are divided into three domains: symptom state, functional state and mental state. Patients are required to respond to each item on a seven-point Likert scale like. The symptoms include breathlessness, mucus level, fatigue, and cough.",

        "description": "We started PulmonaryScan with one goal in mind: educate individuals with bad smoking/vaping habits about the dangers and health risks it imposes on their body, and possibly help them in their journey to become addiction-free. Watching our high school peers greatly harming their fundamental organs gave us a unique perspective on the widespread usage of harmful substances. Additionally, we also understood how pressing other lung issues were to society through research into lung-related diseases. Specifically, COPD was an affliction that we saw as extremely pressing. With that in mind, we thought that a free, quick COPD screening test could positively benefit users as well. After weeks of development, PulmonaryScan was born. With a simplistic design and easy to use interface, PulmonaryScan is divided into 5 sections, which are detailed below:\r\n\r\n\r\nSober Counter: The Sober Counter is a multi-faceted approach to helping those on a path to staying smoking free on their journey. First, the user is prompted to enter in the average amount of usage per week of Cigarettes, Juul Pods, or both. After that, the user will be taken to the main screen, where an auto-updating counter will tell the user how many days they have been able to stay abstinent from their smoking habit (if a user unfortunately consumes smoking products, they can easily hit the \"relapse\" button to start over). Additionally, the Sober Counter will also tell the user how much money they have saved in total over the course of their sober journey, as well as their expected savings of money over the course of the following month and year. This feature will allow the user to directly see the benefits of their tough fight against addiction, hopefully encouraging them to keep up their great work.\r\n\r\nThe COPD Screening test is an interactive questionnaire engineered by PulmonaryScan to help individuals discern if they need further evaluation by a medical professional regarding their COPD/Bronchitis/Emphysema symptoms. This examination is comprised of 8 short questions regarding one's symptoms and conditions, and one interactive question to examine the performance of the user's lungs. Results of the test will then be analyzed, and a recommendation regarding further examination will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nBody Map: The Body Map is an interactive interface in which users can tap into the different body systems to see how smoking specifically affects each part of one's body. Users can read the facts on how smoking affects the capabilities of one's Brain, Mouth/Throat, Heart, Lungs, Stomach, and Reproductive System.\r\n\r\nEffects of Vaping: Users will be taken to a screen where the raw facts of the downsides of Vaping are shown. Additionally, buttons are presented on the screen that lead to more supplementary reading on this harmful practice by leading scientific websites.\r\n\r\nPulmoDaily: This part of the app will directly take you to the PulmoDaily blog ran by PulmonaryScan CEO Mainur Khan. On the PulmoDaily blog, you can read the latest news in the Lung health world, recent advancements in the medical field, and much more.  \r\n\r\nPulmonaryScan is a living app that adapts when new information presents itself, much like Science. The app is inspected every 2 weeks for data fallacies and bug issues. In efforts to maintain optimal user feedback, please visit www.pulmonaryscan.com and fill out the form on the main page if you notice any issue occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe Team:\r\nFounder, Lead Architect, & Chief of Medical Research: Mainur Khan\r\nChief Operating Officer & Lead Application Developer: Pranav Venkatesh\r\nChief Technology Officer & Lead Research Developer: Varun Arumugam\r\nCo- Chief of Business Operations & Digital Media Chief: Kishan Patel\r\nCo- Chief of Business Operations: Shashank Kashyap\r\nMedical Research Developer: Deepak Katta\r\n\r\nInstagram: @pulmonaryscan\r\n\r\nIf we have used your product without permission, please contact us at team@pulmonaryscan.com",

        "description": "The Breathing App is inspired by resonance, the scientific name that describes what happens when our heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, and brainwave function come into a coherent frequency. It occurs spontaneously when we breathe at a rate of five to seven breaths per minute (instead of our usual 15-18). It results in a calm, restful alertness and many other benefits. \r\n\r\nQuick start video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXpsoGHnEiU&list=UUNMy2KojFn0jMbxbHZVppGw&index=4\r\n\r\nAbout Resonance\r\n\r\nThe effects of resonance supports the innate ability of our body, nervous system, and emotions to restore themselves through the balancing of the complementary branches of our autonomic nervous system, which control our heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, respiration, and many other automatic functions of the body. \r\n\r\nThere have been hundreds of scientific studies performed on resonant breathing, which show a wide array of benefits, including reduction of inflammation, reduction of stress, improved sleep, improved resiliency, and strengthening of cardiovascular function. \r\n\r\nHow is it possible for one breathing technique to do so much? The answer lies within our nervous system. By breathing at resonance, we enter into an even balance between the two branches of our autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic (which moves us towards activity) and the parasympathetic, which moves us towards rest. \r\n\r\nThe sympathetic branch is our accelerator, and speeds us up. The parasympathetic is our braking system, which slows us down. We alternate between these two every second of the day, with each breath we take. \r\n\r\nHowever, in our fact paced, information heavy world, we often lean towards acceleration. Spending just a few minutes consciously breathing sends signals of balance to our brain, telling us that we are ok, and brings us out from the part of our brain that makes us feel overwhelmed, into a state of calm. With resonant breathing, you learn how to apply your brake at will, rather than being sidelined by anxiety, distractedness, or excess stress. \r\n\r\nOur world is very much in sympathetic overdrive: we are overly active, overly plugged in, and live in a world of both heated politics and climate. It’s important to learn to cool down, so that we can be as effective in our lives as possible, and conscious breathing is one of the best ways to do that. The Breathing App, by virtue of toning the vagus nerve, reduces inflammation, and induces a state of restful alertness and mental clarity.\r\n\r\nResonant breathing is like a stress reset button.\r\n\r\nAbout the creators of the Breathing App\r\n\r\nEddie Stern, a yoga teacher, author and lecturer from New York, created the concept, and drew the blueprint for the app.\r\n\r\nDeepak Chopra, MD, FACP, NYT best selling author of over 85 books, founder of the Chopra Center and Jiyo.com, guided the science and context behind the app.\r\n\r\nSergey Varichev, an app developer and coder from Belarus, currently living in Amsterdam, did the coding, and co-designed the app. \r\n\r\nMoby, a musician, DJ, author, and photographer born in New York City, who has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, developed the breathing cue sounds.",

            "I watched the youtube video on how to use this app and either you've completely changed what the app does or somethings wrong because there is no welcome page, no choices as described in the video. I just realized I do not have the three screens on my app that allow to choose the amount of time, the ratio and the menu. Can anyone tell me why that is? I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and that didn't work. i have a galaxy s7. Never mind, I figured it out. You have to be smarter than the app. You obviously changed the app and you made it more difficult to figure out. Ok I'm done. :)",
            "A very simple app with limited options. It's pre-programmed with 6 different inhale/exhale ratios (4 sec inhale, 6 sec exhale, 2:3, 5:5, etc) and you can choose the length of time by tapping the screen and pressing the clock button. There is no option for programming your own times. In addition, there are no options for breath holds, and no option for ramping (extending inhales or exhales over time). Home screen is a balloon on black screen (no sound option), swiping left gives the balloon and ocean background, swipe again and you get a count up / count down timer (again, no sound option) first with a black background, swipe and get a forest background (just numbers - doesn't indicate whether it's inhale or exhale by using an arrow or color cue). Swipe again and you get high and low tones and a starry background. There is no option to keep the screen on, so the app stops when my phone goes to sleep unless I keep clicking the button to keep the screen on. All in all, an okay basic breathing app, but would have much better functionality with some options: 1) choose your own inhale/exhale times & be able to save a few different sessions 2) breath holds 3) ramping 4) using sound with the balloon graphic or counting graphic 5) screen on.",
            "There are no screens to chose from, there is no sound. The app seems to be outdated on android. EDIT: Response from the developer was helpful, I just did not get how to use it at first.",
            "Simple resonant breathing app. It is bare bones but effective at its goal of teaching resonant breathing. Watch the how to videos for adjusting the very few settings, basically the time and ratio of your inhale and exhale. It offers different audio cues. There are many other breathing or meditation apps for different results, this one is strictly for resonant breathing. No ads , not much else going on, just press play and off you go. I love the simplicity.",
            "Not customizable whatsoever, besides the back drop. No menus or anything. It just counts to 4. I need a breathing exercise that has longer exhales for my anxiety, and this doesn't help. It gets a bonus star for simple design, though."

This is especially recommended for people with breathing related (asthma, emphysema, COPD) and stress related (anxiety, blood pressure) disorders. In general, medical doctors encourage people to perform Pursed Lip Breathing in order to get more oxygen, to gain more energy or to relax.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This application is designed to work best with BREATHING+ headset. Using your mobile device's built-in microphone may result in damages not covered by your warranty.

It is designed for physicians in aiding in an evidence based approach in diagnostics.*   What a fantastic app. Never has it been more simple to calculate the post test probability. Thank you so much for making this possible. Please do keep updating the database, even if a pay functionality is warranted.",
            "This app organizes raw sign and symptom data to develop a differential diagnosis list. In reverse, it shows the weighting values. It is limited by a small diagnosis list and common diagnoses for which most physicians would not need assistance. It is well written but will see its true proof of concept as more diagnoses are added, bringing decision weight confabulation (in the programming sense) to the algorithm. Well done first effort! Peer reviewed crowd-sourcing might accelerate development."

            "This really helps me, especially the deep calm breathing pattern. Fantastic if you are looking at the screen because it paces you when the inhale, hold and exhale have a different length (4,7,8) The vibrate on step change is also super useful if you can't look at the screen. The only thing I'd really love is a better visualization for when you are holding your breath, but that's a pretty minor quibble. It's great. Try it.",
            "I want to thank the developers for making such a great app. In the current scenario where everyone is making an app that's meant more for gaining profits than making impact on people's lives, this app is meant for the well being of people. Thanks for keeping it add free. Recommended to each and everyone who's thinking of looking after their mental health.",
            "I love the simplicity! And I am thrilled to see the custom timed setting! I like to inhale for 5 seconds through my nose, hold for 5 seconds, and fully exhale for 15 seconds through my mouth, then pause for 2 seconds, and repeat! I can do that with this app perfectly for my specific lung capacity. Thank you so much for this simple 'does exactly what it claims to do' app. It's a real ... breath of fresh air! :)",
            "Hi, I really like the app! I don't think I will continue to use it as I need something where I can change pattern in the middle of a session, but if I didn't need this it'd be great. I prefer to change on the fly, but if enough people wanted it maybe consider adding something where, when setting up the pattern in advance, you can set multiple sets of patterns with a duration for each? Would also love to pick colors, and more sounds. But honestly this really is a lovely app, thank you!!",
            "Really liked it! Simple and just perfect app for breathing exercises and meditation. However, doing for 7 minutes is not enough. Please provide an option of 10 ,15, 20 ,30 mins too in the settings. And may be a graph for duration and consistency."

Please bring back the original voice in the first version as an option. The updated graphics are great tho.",

Maybe some other sound available? What if I want to rename a breathing profile for save it when I change smartphone? Nothing! I mean it's still a valid app but no one behind it. No updates no improvements. I'll change my review as soon as the developer want to show up./ I purchased the app like 4 years ago, I paid for pro version and I didn't see any improvement.

            "This is a really fantastic breathing app. It is intuitive to use, has a range of common preprogrammed exercise but it is also extremely easy to create and customise your own. An added bonus is the lack of intrusive ads. If there is a better free breathing app I would be really surprised.",
            "Wow! Truly an awesome app. I can customize inhale, hold, exhale, hold to 10th of sec. App calculates breaths per minute. I can set total time for a session. Audio cues mean I can breathe with my eyes closed. All of these can be saved to my own custom sessions. The added bonus is the ability to set notifications during the day to remind myself it's time to do a session. Great app!",
            "It's rare that I will give something a positive rating after a mere two days but I am experiencing here with this program is amazing! I have done breathing exercises on my own and under guidance with varying degrees of positive results but this app is (even compared to a teacher's instruction) head and shoulders above everything else! Simple UI, voice and visual guidance, great programs that you can easily dedicate daily practice to...it's just great!",
            "This is a great app for it lets you customized your own breathing program of inhales and exhales in decimal second increments. It also has a timer for how many minutes you want to do the breathing. I really wish they had a better choice for the beginning and end sound beside that loud gong noise for it is distracting after being relaxed from the meditative breathing. That is why the 4 rating.",
            "An excellent app. Specifically because the custom timer allows for tenth of a second adjustments which allows me to set 5.5 second breaths for optimum resonant breathing sessions. I would give 5 stars were I able to set my own colours on the visualiser and change the jarring bell sound to something more muted and soft. This is an app I will use every day."

        "description": "Blow up balloons and collect extra points by making your exhalation longer.\r\n\r\nBreathing Games are based on a breathing technique called Pursed Lip Breathing and they are designed to train kids to make exhalations longer. This is especially recommended for people with breathing related (asthma, emphysema, COPD) and stress related (anxiety, blood pressure) disorders. In general, medical doctors encourage people to perform Pursed Lip Breathing in order to get more oxygen, to gain more energy or to relax.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This application is designed to work best with BREATHING+ headset.

            "I like this app. One thing that would make it better is the ability to set a timer inside it. I don't look at the screen when I breathe with this app. I just listen to the sounds and close my eyes. If I want to breathe for, say, 8 minutes, it would be great if there was a timer I could set in the app that would notify me when I've completed the 8 minutes. Right now, I have to use a separate app for the timer, which is an inelegant solution.",
            "Like the calm interface, the gentle oscillating graphic and particularly like the simple piano tones for breathing. I do wish it had a start button on entering the app. At the moment, as soon as the app opens, it starts. I would prefer to be able to initiate that myself. But still, my preferred app for general breathing exercises. Nice, thank you for the app development.",
            "Would be very helpful to have a timer within the app. Some different sounds would be great too. However! It does what it says on the box. Great app.",
            "Would be better if it included a list of common breathing techniques, and that this app should be open sourced and hosted in F-Droid.",
            "This app needs more recognition, it's easy to use, very customizable, and relaxing. I wish I wouldn't have to set my breathing preferences every time I open the app, but it's one of the best breathing apps by far. Just try it."

            "Good app. I am not using other apps or technology and input everything manually. I'd like to input an activity that I can name myself (eg yoga, abs) and the amount of min I do this (I don't count my steps!). I'd also like larger periods over which I can see an overview of my measurements (eg year), better even if these can be compared (eg BP & activity. Last, would it be possible to have a (large enough) scroll bar so I can scroll down quickly to years earlier. Will give 5* with improvements!!",
            "Inconsistent sync with Google Fit, all the information from Google Fit is off, Sleep is not synced with Google Fit (I track my sleep and there is plenty of data in my Google Fit cloud every day but none of it ever synced with MedM). No Berrymed oximeter devices listed. I wish I could use this app but currently I can't rely on it. I am adding a star in advance to help developers in dealing with vendors and ask for more ways of export (like generating a pdf to send to doctor from within the app).",
            "I complained about the app not working with my kinetic band. I was told it had been sorted. It hasnt I've tried over and over to sync but despite the app saying it has synced it hasn't. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to no avail. So im uninstalling again. Waste of time.",
            "After syncing with the scales it leaves a non dismissable notification on the phone. He only way to get rid of it is to restart the phone.",
            "I Have used it for years now. Mostly pretty good as far as I can make out. Only issue is, it says I only have 39% muscle mass. Which doesn't add up. I'm 5'10, 93kgs, and I am mostly muscle. So I cant figure it out. Lol"

Before it would vibrate once for each action (inhale, hold, exhale) but now it vibrates twice when it's on hold, confusing you to whether it's moving on to the next action or not. I'm not sure if this is due to the new update or not but I hope it can be fixed! Besides that it's great!",

(2) a visual general timer to know how far you are in the exercise (3) some way of the knowing that exercise has finished (4) need ad free version (5) off line version, do all these & you'll get 5 stars, keep up the good work",

In my personal experience, I have noticed how my stress levels have been reduced and I have been able to cope with my day to day life (now with the COVID 19) in a healthy way. Just by breathing in a certain way one can improve our state of mind. Thank you for the person/s who created this amazing app",

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

        "comments": [
            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

The Tamegagi scoring criteria used in this application is an accepted method of identifying patients for lung cancer screening and has been shown to be superior in sensitivity while maintaining specificity as compared with the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrollment criteria. Use this tool with patients to identify if your patient is eligible for lung cancer screening and to show them the impact smoking is having on their risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nWhat is lung cancer and why is lung cancer screening important?\r\n\r\nLung cancer is a cancer that develops in the parenchyma or airways of the lungs and is most commonly related to smoking, which is the biggest risk factor for this disease. Lung cancer is difficult to identify early due to a lack of specific symptoms, and therefore typically presents at an advanced stage where cure is more difficult and sometimes not possible. Recently, two major studies have been able to show an improvement in survival for patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer and are screened with an annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in 2015 the US Preventative Task Force (USPTF) endorsed a recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This rating was given a “B” grade which indicates with high certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening, which is the same grade given to mammography for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral groups, including Tammemagi et al and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have suggested that today’s screening guidelines may be missing patients who are at risk due to other factors than smoking history and age, such as comorbidities like COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, family history of lung cancer, or certain higher risk minorities. In fact, Tammemagi scoring was found to have improved sensitivity of 83% over the 71% of USPSTF while maintaining specificity of approximately 63%. Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.\r\n\r\nThis application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic\r\nMarkRWaddle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGraphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

We update our app regularly to improve your experience and make it faster and more reliable, as well as bringing diverse radio stations, new and popular podcasts and music.

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

I try to think that's it's just a mistake we can't do anything about it but the glitch level is really too much. I can't handle it anymore! Pls fix it! Hero dash is much better, try to make this game like tom hero dash. And are you serious? 6 hours of waiting just for unlocking a silly vault in a game? The torture is too much. Very mad 😫😵😢👿",
            "This game is really fun and it helps me get past time. Theres just on problem. This is neither happening to me or a few people. When I try to cross over to a different neighborhood through the tunnels I some time go under the road and it lags or theres some kind of invisible wall. Anyways its probobly just my internet. It's a great app. I would say the same thing for talking tom hero dash but leave out the tunnel part. That game is fun too. And a bit better.",
            "This is an amazing app! I love how its wifi free too! Idon't have any problems with it, though, sometimes the app IS a bit glitchy, but that has only happened a few times. At the moment, i am on the second tom up! I DO have a few things you could add to this game such as double jump and add more themes like underwater. I like the under ground bits where you turn up in a whole new world like the skateboard one, in the air, the sewers and ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER!",
            "This game is so cute😊 and cool at the same time. You can get characters like Tom,Angela,Ginger,Hank&Ben that's so cool and when you are running you can even go to different worlds like the underwater world,the dessert etc. The game play run smooth when you dob't have on you're wifi or you're service. This game don't let you stay on one running bath tou can go to different parts.",
            "Very adorable and fun game! Great way to pass time! All the characters are very cute and I smile everytime I play. I love the skateboarding part!Quite a cheaper version of Subway Surfers but much much cuter. But I don't really like the controls. Please make them more sensitive, or improve them overall."

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it.

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "Fun game. If there are ads, I never noticed them... completely unobtrusive. And you can literally play for years without spending a penny of real money. The only downsides for me was the ultimate boredom in trying to get the last few spaces on the board, it takes too long. And the weekend events, while giving great rewards, will take nearly every minute of your weekend days to complete. I finally gave up trying to finish the game and uninstalled, but I would recommend giving it a go.",
            "I really enjoy playing the game (only reason why I gave 3 stars), however it keeps coming out of the game and forgetting my progress. Also, things get expensive the further in you go, and I've only been playing it for less than a week! Today by forgetting my progress, it lost me some treasures I would have used to get dragon eggs, which is the only way to advance the game. Ads take me out of the game. Ultimately I'm frustrated with the game and am considering finding something else 😬😒☹️😡😟",
            "The camp economy needs redone. I have to pay gems for everything I work for, and what I receive is not valuable. I opened a level 5 chest, and only received 145 coins and nothing else. The two stars are only there because of the memories when I played this years ago. I know you guys can improve. I don't want to have to switch to a different merge game. P.S. Accidents are fatal. For example, when you're going for a high level item and then merging 3 objects instead of 5.",
            "Such a great game! Graphics are amazing and it's great puzzling fun. One suggestion I have is to make a lock or pinned feature for objects, so they're not as easy to move around if you don't want them to. I also suggest some kind of warning or countdown for when the special events are ending. I like to collect everything at the end, and I tend to lose track of time. I didn't get anything I worked hard for for three days... so annoyed, and it's my own fault but wow. A little notice would be nice",
            "This is a good game to sink time into when nothing else is going on. What I don't like is that purple stars are imposible to get unless you spend real money. I haven't had a purple star drop in more than two months... And I can't justify the cost to buy the gems with real money. It would be nice to have a trade option to purchase the gems with things earned through game play. I'm stuck on some quests because of this \"feature.\""

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

So I don't know what happen since the recent update on the app. Please fix it or is it something else with my printer. I have network and wifi is good. So is it the app?",
            "Even after the latest update, most features, including the all-important scan from printer, are now unavailable, rendering my expensive printer worthless. It tries to connect me with HP Web Services (which past versions never required), which then gets me an \"invalid request\" error every time. Awful, awful, awful app. Nonexistent support from HP. Avoid!",
            "Terrible. Absolutely awful. It worked for a while and now I can't connect my device to the printer because it claims I am not on the same network or something. HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",
            "Rendered useless come on HP what have you done to the app. It no longer is working and I need so much done doe work. This is so inconvenient especially working at home with no other access. This printer was bought to be used. Please fix the. There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",
            "Same here. It was working great then I tried to print a recipe from my phone the other day and it won't work. I have checked settings, passwords, IP addresses. It shows it is there but it can't find it. I have disconnected, unplugged and am just over the whole frigging mess."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

I'm now on level 1539 and every day I have to watch numerous ads in order to progress in the game. This is a fun game but the developer is making this game worse with every update. 1 star.",
            "This game is trash when you reach a certain level. It purposefully gives you the wrong color bubbles when there's only color changing bubbles left on the board so you have to use your boosters and watch commercials. Time to uninstall.",
            "I used to love this game but since the latest update released on 29 October, the beam shot no longer works properly. It is only destroying the bubbles you can see on the screen and not to the top.",
            "It's a good game for a while. After a bit, though, it gets to the point where the levels are too hard to beat without 4 or 5 tries. There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",
            "The issue with getting not getting the colored right ball to progress through the level is still happening. Please make the rainbow ball more useful. I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed."

            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely.

It is perfectly natural to breathe through the mouth at certain terms such as when running or lifting heavy objects, however if breathing occurs through the mouth habitually then it can lead to many health problems. These problems can be particularly severe for children as mouth breathing can affect the long term development of the face and jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n In this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nasthma\r\nshortness of breath\r\nbreathing problems\r\ncopd treatment\r\ntrouble breathing\r\nlung problems\r\ndifficulty breathing\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about Breathing Problems Treatment : \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that almost 80% of people suffer from a deviated nasal septum and Septoplasty is one treatment which has been helping them overcome the problems caused by it. Nasal septum is a wall like lining in the nose which separates the cavities of the nose into two equal halves. Ideally this wall should be in the midline of the nose thereby making equal passages on the right and left sides. The nasal septum consists of a central cartilage which provides support and is covered with mucus membrane on both sides. If this septum is not in the midline of the nose or is deviated, it can cause severe breathing problems.\r\n\r\nCauses, Symptoms and Effects\r\n\r\nNasal septum deviation can be caused either through some injury to the nose or it can even be present by birth. Excessive growth of the skeleton system can also be a reason for deviated septum and cause the nasal passages to be blocked. Some of the most common symptoms of a deviated nasal septum are blockages in either one or both nostrils, obstructed breathing, nasal congestions, chronic sinus, infections, bleeding of the nose, snoring, breathing through the mouth, headaches and facial pain.\r\n\r\nPeople suffering from deviated nasal septum often complain about breathing obstruction, congestion, headaches and sinusitis troubles. This deviation can significantly obstruct the flow of air from the nasal passage as well as not allow a nose to be completely clear of the sinus and mucus drainage. In extreme cases, the deviation could also affect the outward structure of the nose causing it to alter shape and leave the nose looking collapsed. In such cases, Rhinoplasty - a type of cosmetic surgery is the only way to correct it.\r\n\r\nHow Septoplasty works\r\n\r\nSeptoplasty is the most effective treatment for correcting a deviated nasal septum. This process is conducted via the nostrils, thereby ensuring that there are no bruises and no signs of surgery. The procedure involves realigning the portion of cartilage or bone which is bent in the nasal cavity. Local or general anaesthesia administered before the process and an incision is made via the nostrils on the septum to reach the affected area. It is ensured that there is sufficient cartilage being preserved so that it can provide structural support to the nose. After aligning the septum to the correct position, it is given a temporary stability with the help of small plastic sutures. \r\n\r\nSeptoplasty has helped a lot of patients to completely or partially eliminate the symptoms of deviated nasal septum. This procedure clears the blockage of the nose passage thereby allowing smooth breathing and clear nostrils. It also helps in avoiding any chronic infections or sinus that could have developed due to the obstruction as well as provides a structural support to the nose and preventing and facial damage",

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Having tried this app out by recording last month's symptoms and calling up the chart, I couldn't export it even though I have a Google address. Then I found that one of the symptoms appeared on today's date, when I haven't had it today. There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",
            "The app ws working great for a few months. I was tracking everything in readiness for an important doctors appointment next week. Woke up this morning to find all my tracking has gone! And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",
            "Can't export data because I can't add an email. Can't fix this because the email address provided on Google Play Store is no longer valid. Very, very disappointed and sad. This app is incredible but without being able to export data, it's 100% useless.",
            "very simple and easy to use for recording symptoms. the reporting leaves something to be desired. I'd like to be able to select one symptoms and then see how all the factors compare for that one symptom instead of selecting then one at a time.",
            "Excellent. Simple, customizable and for the data junky: exportable. I use it to track any environmental variable, moods, sleep, excercise, water etc and of course every outcome: vigor, acuity and the negative of course headaches, etc etc. Along with myfitnesspal it's the only health ap I need."

            "(1) Why do i need to allow access to my Google Play Games Account again & again ? I don't want to enable auto-sign in because i don't want to get registered to Games i am trying out everytime. None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",
            "Great game...i play this game for a years now...but we are tired in old maps... So i hope you create maps every month and add (SIGN IN WITH FACEBOOK) and (SIGN IN WITH GOOGLE) I hope you read this...thank you for making us happy #NOBODYSHOT LTD...Nobody is shot while making this product heheシ︎シ︎",
            "No doubt, one of the favorable games i can actually step into & make it all happen. Been playin for a few years and it doesnt get old. Play on"

Very off putting on an otherwise good app.",

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",

I would like to appreciate this game. But sorry, I will give only 4 rating because you need to improve this game with more fun. So sorry but please do improve it. The game is so awesome. I liked this game👍👍👍",

Try this app now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This app is great! Tom and his friends are soooo cute🤩 There are many surprises to discover and endless possibilities to do! The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people more😜plaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

Also, when I try to play a movie, the ads are endless. And when they end, it's just a screen with the crackle logo. I would rate this -1/5 stars if there was an option to do that. Plz do not install.

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

Update: Having played the game for a while longer, I'm frustrated because the follow options are not working: - Being able to select \"Extra Cannon\" in the store. When selecting it it says \"Can't connect to the store, please check your connection. My connection is fine. The other 2 options in the store take a while to activate once you enter the store: - Free Heart option by watching a video - x50 diamonds by watching a video. If these options are time delayed, it would be handy to show the countdown.",
            "Too many ads. Literally 1 after every level. Plus, the game input is laggy, so your cannon is always behind where you're touching on the screen. These people suck at making video games. I hope they die of cancer. France is the worst country in the world. Only losers live there.",
            "This app is very cool & fun to play. Very challenging. As compared to other games it contains very ads. Sounds and colours also add some spice. After if you add all of this it is the perfect game I have ever played!!!. This game is also rated for all ages which I really liked about it.",

Up until It stops and go back to normal...but like I said this is wu-an-derful...keep it up. This thing also blacks out...and to much ads",
            "It's a very hard game but addicting at the same time, since the new updates this game has wayyyyyyyyyy to many AD's. And try to find away were we can save from where we left off if we ever decide to delete the game."

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",

The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",

            "Started playing it, thought it would be 3D or as advertised but it isn't, never mind that, game is too much for my device, way too many things happening. Plus the tutorial is so long, I ended up just building and upgrading things I don't know. In fact all the building made me want to play Sim city, if they designed it that way it be enjoyable.",
            "The only reason I am not giving this game 5 stars is that there is no reward for those who don' t spend a lot of money. All events pull you in to spending money - its a choice, I know but can't some events reward perseverance, loyalty and time? It is impossible to be ranked in anything without spending. The difference in players is obscene. In our kingdom (798) it is impossible to survive without being shielded 24/7, which costs. Saying all that, it's bloody fantastic!",
            "Great Game but only way to Play is to PAY !!! If your short on money this game is definitely not for YOU !!! You can play the game without spending but it will take you forever to build. And you will be constantly being farmed by larger opponents healing your troops and losing your resources. Better to Play a one shooter game or download solitary.",
            "There are several issues with this game. First when tapping the bar to increase resource amount then it maxes it out. This caused me to loss all resource I have gotten so to attack because there is no real good way to get shields that I have determined. Alot of stuff to build that really does not help you at low levels. They say it is used as you get higher level but is very inconvenient at times as it feels like you are missing something. When you are killed you very little resource back even",
            "I really liked this game at first until y'all decided to start charging more and more for everything. Honor pass used to be 2 bucks, then 3 now you want 5 for it. You charge people to get the items just to try and play some of your activities but then you don't even give them enough. And the glitches and bugs? I've had millions of resources removed from my account, I've had issue with claiming on prize packs in my messages. It's ridiculous because no new players are added to our kingdoms ever."

Last update has the banners across game almost impossible to move and stuck on 1872 with last phase there are no diamonds to actually pass the level. Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",

If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",

As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Worst printer app. Very unreliable. Everytime I want to print something it says my printer is not available. 90% of the time it doesn't work. Makes my printer useless. Very frustrating. Not the first time Canon apps have disappointed me. Had the same problem with their camera app. I'll be thinking twice before buying another Canon product. Even if it's a good deal.",
            "Not \"quick and easy\" or functional... Installed the app. Upon opening the app, a static instructional page is displayed telling me to print from outside the app. Moving on to print a document, I select the canon option that now appears from the list of printers and get a nearly blank screen asking for the printer's IP address (unable to be detected itself from it's WiFi function) Searching Canon's troubleshooting page, I end up printing out a configuration page from the printer's menu, and I type in the IP address from a sheet of paper. The confirmation button stays greyed out. My only option is to cancel and delete the app. Because apparently it's just a waste of time.",
            "I'm disappointed that double-sided printing is not supported. The option is present but greyed out. I raised the issue with Canon support but their unhelpful response was \"if the option is greyed out then it is not supported\" even though the printer does do double-sided printing when used with other products, just not the Canon Print Service!",
            "The latest update removed functionality of the print service for me and my MG6220. The app/service (which now needlessly forces an icon into the Apps list) no longer automatically finds my printer, and when I try to manually find it by IP address, the app opens a numeric-only keyboard (no way to input decimal points for the address!).",
            "I will Never buy another Canon anything again!!!!! When I first got the pixma it worked pretty good. But ever since August it has a mind of its own! It will print one page then grab 50 pieces of paper at once from the paper tray! The next time it won't print at all. I got the Ivy cliq ( for free) and it works on its own but to try and get it to print pictures from your phone? Forget it. I give up! Done with Canon!!"

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "I love Dragons, so this is very enjoyable for me. Still learning the game only level 86 i think, so still a lot to do to master the game. Update 10/16/2020 I am now over level 110 my dragons are getting stronger and accomplishing more in the gane, it just keeps getting better and better. Definitely worth 5 star rating and if it were possible 10 star. Keep up the great work everyone!!",
            "I'd rate this game 5⭐, but everytime I try to watch an ad (for extra rewards), it keeps saying \" No ads available \" , then after about 3 minutes of try to get the ad to play, the game crashes, and have to wait another 2 minutes for the game to load again...If this issue gets fixed I'll change my review to 5⭐, but as it currently is, the game is practically unplayable. (Suggestion: if there's no ad available, you could have it auto give the rewards. Rather than having the game constantly crash.)",
            "This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics! The game play is easy to learn and use. I like that the dragons look lifelike versus other games where the dragons look more like a cartoon. I only gave 4 stars because you can't use a dragon's special weapon until a certain criteria has been reached in the game, which I haven't been able to reach yet.",
            "I've been planning this for a couple of months now and I find it fun and easy to play even though I cannot buy anything with cash because Google locked me out of my account. It's super addictive and got some of my friends and family to start playing too. I only need to spend about 20 minutes or so 3 or 4 times a day and I in the top 40% of the server.",
            "Extremely fun BUT... one of the most expensive games if you want to try to support the devs. If things were cheaper I'd actually spend some money, but 25 + a month for auto play and no adds... no one time purchase options. 30+ for battle passes... The high prices forced a bad rating for a great game. I will probably search for another game to support. Dropped to a 1 star, legion chat always disappears leaving you with no idea about who has asked questions or anything. Pathetic devs."

            "I have to go through the level finishing right at the start. Is this a joke to you? Whenever you hold to try and make the ball go down, you can only get to about 5 or 6 lines and then it just stops and tells you the level is completed. Please fix this. Incredible amounts of lag due to loading Advertisement and overall rubbish. This could do with less advertisement, more bug fixing and communicating. I think this app is lazy and unfinished so this is why I put 1 star. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!",
            "I give 4 star because I love this game sooooo much but there is one problem there is soo much ads, When I just Start play the ad will come. But whatever I just love this game!!! 💕",
            "This game is very easy and fun to play! I love this app I can never get off it. It's sooo amazing I can get different collective items every day and they look amazing! My favorite one is the bomb because it's super deadly in different ways. If you don't like this game then you are totally boring because this game is super fun! So if I were you I would go on play store, DOWNLOAD the app and give it 5 stars.",
            "I don't think so. I could take an ad after three or four levels, but after 2 is ridiculous. Plus, the game cheats. You are not touching the ad at all, you're just sitting there waiting for the \"X\" out, and before you can \"X\" out the app OPENS Google Play. That sucks and it's dishonest. I did not want to go to Google Play.",
            "Decent game, tend to enjoy it when I need to kill time. Only problem is the ads. The levels are long enough to not feel constantly bombarded by ads, and this game runs well if you disconnect from WiFi. In this game you can continue from where you lost if you watch a video. But if you say you don't want to continue, it will often play an ad anyway and not give you anything in return? Why play an ad if I just hit a button to not watch an ad and restart the level?"

            "I am still quite new to this app. I like the selection, the dark mode, and that it can disappear while still playing. I don't like how messy it is. Visually distracting and distressing. Too much to look at or see at one time.",
            "I been using it for about 2yrs now I'm satisfied I'm able to listen to stations all over the world if you don't mind the commercials this is the app for you, anything goes wrong reboot it or the wifi continue to work no problem.",
            "This app used to be pretty good for listening to radio stations (which is why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1), but lately its ad to music ratio has gotten very high. For example, I use it to listen to music while I exercise. This morning, the last SIX MINUTES of my workout were solid ads. I don't mind the odd ad between every couple of songs, but not for six straight minutes. I'm removing this app and finding something else for my music listening.",
            "It has stability problem. Many times suddenly it stops until you open it again and play your favorite channel. It's really frustrating. Plz do something for this problem."

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "Love the game. I'm only giving it a mid rating is because of the ads. Recently there is a repetitive ad for weight loss that looks sketchy, people talk but there's no dialogue, just an annoying soundtrack. There's no product name. I think it's a phishing scam. There used to be a small icon with an ! that gave you the option to hide an ad that was either repetitive or irrelevant, but that has disappeared. Instead now you have to actually close the app and restart it to get rid of the ad.",
            "The game is top notch! A couple of major detractors though. 1. Advertising is way out of hand. Most ads now require two dismissals before going away. The advertisers are also working very hard to disguise the dismissals for the sole reason of keeping their page up as long as possible. And, sorry Mobilityware, there are many instances in which the ad cannot be dismissed after 5 seconds, such as Disney and Purina. 2. The daily goals needs to have a 'turn-off' feature. The speed penalty is too hi",
            "I truly love playing this strategic game!!! It really makes you think outside the BOX!! Not only that, it relaxes your entire mind, body, and soul!! It's a comparative game; in which, it gives you a GREAT!! Brain- Work-out, knowing that you can actually select the RIGHT- COMBINATION OF MOVES and go from one level to the next. I relax with this strategic game daily. Carolyn Reese Atlanta, Georgia OCTOBER 14, 2020",
            "Like game not the ads. I have been playing for over a year. You needs the ads for revenue, I got that. However, pictures of a women's ass in tight clothes is not what I am looking for. If I wanted that I would go to a different site. So select less explicit ads or I go elsewhere. PS children play these games. So you are contributing to the delinquency of minors.",
            "Another great app ruined by ads and greed... I'd happily pay to remove the stupid ads but they're greedy, they want a subscription! 😆 just charge a one time charge like everyone else. I'm not paying for a subscription that's just nuts.. I've been playing for years and now I'm leaving, plenty of other solitary apps. Also notice all the people complaining about the ads and the developers done NOTHING."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "Honestly, I've played this game before, so I got it again, only to be disappointed. Whenever I create (or try to) my viking, it stops at the name and says there is a problem registering my viking. Other people are having this issue, but I will keep the game and see if it's resolved soon. Jumpstart Games, fix your game, please.",
            "It's overall a good game that I can spend my time on, but there are a lot of issues that makes many people frustrated. The infamous Battle Event glitch keeps appearing and it sucks. Also, stop changing the Battle Event rewards for the events. I just want to farm gems without engaging in the event, but it forces me to get candy instead. Events should be, well, an event that gives players an option to engage in it or not. Thawfest was the reason why I kept the game uninstalled for months.",
            "It has been awesome playing this game and I love it !!!!!!! I'm glad that you fixed the wild dragon disappearing thing !! But .....I can't do like ....anything ! Cuz you have to pay money for gems and you can't do anything if you don't have gems ! I'd love it if you made there be less coin spending on the new quests and stuff like that !! Please do !!",
            "This game is great.... except that the chat system is awful (the chat is a tad bit too censored and you could get banned for a simple mistake, even though they don't even tell what you said wrong, they just tell you that you said something wrong), the graphics aren't the best, but not the worst, and the controls (especially for decorating the farm) are kinda terrible. But, I suppose it is somewhat decent if you look past the issues. Also, the teen dragons are very glitchy and broken.",
            "It's a fun game overall, but it's also a Pay-to-Win game. You either have to spend money on memberships or gems to do any of the fun quest, or grind for months. I have a membership account and it gets boring because theres no quests until a big update. You should add daily quest to level up your dragons, or just to do something fun. And I also get constantly get \"Logged Out\" of the game. Please fix that. And the chat is horrible. I can't say Hi or I get muted. But overall, it's a decent game."

Has more mini games than talking tom/talking angela/ the one with the purple thing that theyve made like 7 editions to/ also more custom options than all the other ones too. Its very kid friendly (im 19 i can justify even though i have no kids) the only way you can make friends is through email. Highly sugest",
            "i just love love this game but i don't lt really like how it makes me pay real mony to get the baby potion and the adult potion. But there is 4 bugs the first one is Whenever i get of the game and get back on it gliches and it makes it hard to play. The other bug is that when i get a new pillow it looks wierd.The next bug is some games i play aren't working. The last bug is on beach volly my pet is cheating! And that really makes me mad! So please fix those bugs and it is hard to level up!",
            "i like pou but i have 5 bugs the first bug is that i dont like that you have to pay 99$ to have the baby potion. the next bug is that when you have to play the same games over and over again. the 3rd bug is that when you buy a pillow it looks wired. the forth bug is that when you go play volly ball on pvp it won,t let you do it. the last bug is when i get on pou it turns in to a recktangoll and it makes my costume werid so pleas fix the those bugs.",

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

There are also many glitches in this app which are a big problem. So please fix these problems other wise this is an excellent app 😊😊. It is also a really interesting and fun app. It would also be really nice if there were an option to save the video as a gif.",
            "It is good ....application but we have filters only when we download or have an account in Instagram so in that way I didn't like this application but it is very good app to make GIFs and more ...thank you for developers for developing the app ... And please make one more app that has filters...",
            "Fun but high failure rate. About 23% of the videos I made were corrupt, didn't save properly or something. Given it's a moment-in-time capture which is hard to recreate (esp of animals), that high a failure rate is terrible. Still a fun app to use, to make short videos. Would be cool if there's an option to capture longer videos and an option to save the video as a gif.",
            "Its ok, I was really hoping to free hand the placement of the pictures. Everything else is ok. Not excellent or good. Less options to choose from then expected. The option to blur out was cool but only allowed to resize the blur not pant with it. So it was tricky. Not the best but not the worst. Can tell someone has put thought into it.",
            "Just use the built-in function You can do the exact same minimal functions from the instagram app. However on here, the save feature doesnt work (continuously loads) so you can only post to feeds/stories and it doesn't allow you to choose which account to post to if you have multiple logged in. Fairly pointless when the key feature of 'pointing camera, recording in boomerang style, and saving to device gallery' doesnt work properly"

They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",
            "If there is a single game that I have enjoyed thoroughly through the years and have never been frustrated with, its sdorica! From the music to the story (which is a 12/10!!!) You cannot go wrong, give it a try!",
            "Im giving this one star because while I adore this game I can only play on wifi. I have a good 4g connection on my galaxy s9 plus and it keeps asking for a stable connection. Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

            "Great Game, Ridiculous Pricing! I downloaded Paint By Numbers recently and found that I really enjoyed it. They make painting these fun, there's a rewards system and achievements. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it... that is until I saw the pricing. $5 a WEEK!! Or the option for $70 EVERY YEAR! No thanks. Game is great, but pricing model killed it.",
            "Hi, I really really love this game the best, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because when i went today to check my library which is were I finished the pictures, the pictures won't show colored they would show blank and I tried to color them back but when I left the app and came back all my pictures that I painted are blank again! So please fix it then I will enjoy it and give a five star overall I recommend this game its so relaxing and its addictive omg I love this app.",
            "Very relaxing way to spend a few minutes. Pick your pictures right and they come out brilliantly. Only thing I had to change was the highlighter to a brighter one, couldn't see the grey one. Other than that it's great, and addictive, once you have done one and seen what it looks like you immediately want to do another. Finished ones can also be downloaded 👍",
            "Had to factory reset my phone and now all of my purchased gems are gone as well as completed pictures and purchased collections. No ok at all. Further to my review, ive contacted support numerous times to no avail. Ive done everything asked of me, provided sufficient answers to all questions and provided evidence. Ive been fobbed off and told \"we will look into it\" and \"we will fix this\" over and over but nothings been fixed. Either give me my gems back or refund my money. Con artists & thiefs!",
            "I really love this app. The pictures are super awesome! I can however only give 3 stars for now cause everytime I finish a picture it wants to play an ad(which is fine) if the ads worked. With the ads not working I can't move on to the next picture. If that was fixed I would give 5 stars no prob. But I can only do one picture and have to close the app. If you made it so I can continue even if the ads don't actually play I would also give 5 stars. Thanks for your time! Much love."

            "This app deserves 6 STARS!!!! I love the fact that it gives you the option to list apps from most recent to oldest. I usually share apps using wifi direct between my samsung phones, and this app has never let me down. Does not affect battery life on none of my phone, which was my primary concern. An app that doesn't consume (much) battery isn't certainly doing any background activity. It's a free app, and a good one too; therefore the least I can do is to write this sort of lengthy review, lol.",
            "This is a very good app. There is a SELECT ALL but it's not obvious, long press any single apk, then tap select all context menu. It's also a little odd that there is no save option only share but that's not too much of a problem since you can share to your a file explorer with the added advantage that you can save to any location that you choose at the time rather than a default folder. Overall a very good app.",
            "I'm always skeptical about these kind of apps because they keep promising things and don't deliver. I tried other apps and no luck but this app worked instantly, I'm actually amazed. I transferred an app to my tablet from my phone via WiFi direct and it worked. Now I'm using the app on my tablet. Thank you app developers for making a genuinely easy app to use and that works what it was intended for. I had to write this to let others know. Thank you once again.",
            "I hate it.when i use this app and the transfer finished the other device need to install it say \"app not installed\" and i try it again \"app not installed \"plss fix it.",

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "I got so many memories in this. Before my mother had new phone in 2020. Go back to 2019 or 2018 I do not remember. At that time Iwas going to play Exploration Lite, then (Because I was a kid and this was new for me) when I opened Exploration Lite, it's Kiloblocks Lite and I am scared becsuse it is not Exploration Lite anymore. Then I played dis and it is so fun. I like this and played, so many new blocks and dis game does know what it needs and not. I build so many. Thank you forso many memories",
            "Alright, I'm rating this 5 stars for giving me so many memories. I remember asking for my moms phone to play \"Exploration Lite\". If you didn't, this game used to be called that. But I remember different terrain and more blocks to use. I don't really know why they removed these features. It made the game fun when you don't have the real Minecraft. But seriously, this game has given me so much nostalgia just by playing it. Thank you for the fun memories.",
            "I love this game! It does need to update it. There should be a save button. I should not worry about closing the tab by accident and my build being gone. They also need to have more inventory to build with. This game would also be really fun if you could play with others, for example put in a code and your friend could join.. Overall it is a good game but PLEASE ADD A SAVE BUTTON AND A FRIENDS MODE!",
            "The game brings back memories back when this game was called Exploration Lite. I remember the time I made a big square house and then I pressed recent tab and all my progress was gone lol. I loved this game... Still do. This was when Google Play was called Play Store - The good times. I had a lot of games - Moshi monsters, glow hockey, Temple Run 1, 2 and every OG game. Now Google Play is riddled with good games that are ruined because of in-game ads and marketing ads. (99% fail etc)",
            "When I was scrolling down my library page on my phone I found this and just gave me a wave of nostalgia this was the Minecraft when you can't afford it I remember building a wal mart and it was so satisfying when I completed it but it didn't have a save feature so it didn't last for very long anyways it was a good game."
