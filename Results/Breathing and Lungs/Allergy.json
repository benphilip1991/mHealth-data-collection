            "Uses a pollen counter that only applies to 36 cities (both small & large) around the US, which makes this component of the app completely useless for the majority of the US. Example: my closest pollen count location is 248 miles away. So, it reports that the pollen count is low when it's actually very high (I live in an area devastated by Hurricane Michael & our allergen counts are always through the roof). If they change where they derive their data from, I'll be back. Garbage app.",
            "The app hasn't updated since covid. All the stats stay the same all the time. Please fix your app. It used to work so well, now, not so much. I am uninstalling. Tired of waiting for REAL fixes. Every update says it fixes something, but the app just looks the same. Everything low but dust, which is extremely high. Nothing ever changes anymore and since such, no notifications are received any longer (android device).",
            "Useless. It never updates the location. I travel and it only shows my old location when the app was first opened. It has permission to use my location. So, I do not use this app on Android. It works fine on my iPhone.",

            "What happened? This app has been pretty good. But all of a sudden I get the daily alerts that levels are high, but when I open the app all levels are blue in color and shown as \"low\". This started a week or two ago. It's no longer showing real levels."

However, when I press \"Done\" after logging my symptoms I get an error code \"Could not get object(s) at this time\". This makes the app pretty useless for me. I hope you can fix this so I can love the app!",

I like being able to track my daily symptoms & compare to the current pollens. I have been able to determine which pollens trigger my allergies from using this app consistently. My only complaint would be in the symptoms tracker, I really wish there was a section for ears and chest. ***8/18/20 update, the newest update is incredible it's easy to use and easy to see the pollen count!",

Even while the option is already selected. It also had loading issues when I first logged in. I had to force close it and open the app again to make it register. Closing the app did nothing for the log though.",

One way this could actually be effective is for only non-chain restaurants to be listed that don't have their information online.",
            "The app is great!! I only wish more info was available. When we are planning to go somewhere and there is no info because no one has rated the restaurant it would be great to have info based on other related stores or just general info about the restaurant policies and procedures relating to allergies easily available.",
            "This app is great, you can type in your or your child's allergies and the city and state. The options come up and what is great is it is not just a star rating system it also has the reviewers allergies and comments directly from them. And you know how the establishment handled those specific allergies! So great!",
            "I always have this app on hand when traveling to choose a place that others have eaten at safely. There aren't quite enough restaurant ratings yet (but there are a lot: there are more here than anywhere else), so please download this app and rate the restaurants your eat at: for my sake, if not for your own! :)"

This won't be helpful for me and my family, so I uninstalled it.",

            "This quit allowing me to save my injections about 3 weeks ago. To make it work, I had to go to the apps setting on my Android phone, and remove permissions for this app to use location. Once I did that, then I could save my injections as normal. I assume they will get some patch out to fix this problem, and then I can turn locations back on for this app, and once again be able to see pollen levels for my area.",

            "Edit: The Feb 27 update fixed the issue with notifications. That's far too long in my opinion for a specialized app such as this which has one specific purpose. Hoping the app developers can do better in the future to address issues such as these. The app otherwise gets the job done logging allergy shots that you take. The Jan 17 update broke notifications on my S8+. Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, notifications no longer work.",
            "Getting the confirmation code while originally signing up for this app was very difficult. Furthermore, the notifications portion of this app does not seem to work at all even though it is turned on and my notifications on my phone are all turned on. On a positive note, it is a very convenient way of logging your shots."

It starts with today's date & you have to go backwards, month by month to get to your birthday, March 2020, February 2020, January 2020, December 2019 to your birth year. Really?! Makes no sense, called app creator listed & they tried to blame the doctors office. Just forget it.",
            "App work for a couple of months in early 2019, but haven't gotten it to work since. I have uninstalled and reinstall several times. Entering my info is no big deal DOB is easy but then I just keep getting the dreaded OOPS something went wrong. Never does connect. Poor app.",
            "Should rate a 0. It won't even download! I used to have it. Stopped working so I dumped it. Months later I am TRYING to download it again. It just keeps saying \"waiting for download\"..... Then it finally times out, and nothing. So frustrated!!!",
            "Poor UX, especially the set up screens and the date picker. Once you get it working, it's very basic. It would be easier to have discreet fields for day, month, year, rather than have to go through the date picker, as changing the year is not obvious and the picker requires a lot of work. It would be easier for me to tap in numbers rather than open a date picker, hunt for how to change the year, then once I get there, go in the correct direction to find the correct month, then day.",
            "Disappointed. I uninstalled & reinstalled after reading the lastest review. My office informed me that that app was having issues & that developers were working out the bugs (working in IT, I emphasize). So, after reading the 12/30 review, I thought everything was fixed. I'm still getting the \"Opps\" error message. It also says that this was made for an \"older\" version of Android. That's not good for us who updated our phones earlier last year. Please help!"

Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. \r\nCommon allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors.

            "Great/simple, no nonsense app.👍So far as I can tell it is accurate too.(I have very bad allergies and need to stay informed and everytime it has been accurate thus far)I don't really use the forecast as much, but the current day and next day seem accurate. (They change in real time, often dramatically) the forecast for 4 days I think, if I can remember correctly ;it has tree pollen and grass counts and one more maybe that I'm forgetting. I love the simplicity and visual presentation.",
            "I'm sure the figures are accurate somehow, I certainly suffer watery eyes and sneezing when the bar is higher, but they don't explain themselves. Today's figure is 1.2 (aggregate? max? no idea) while the three icons above show 🌲 5.2 🌾 1.7 💐 2.2. So what is 1.2? Totally confusing, and I'd rather have more info, than less. I would certainly benefit from a widget showing today's reading. Now it just has this perpetual notification saying looking up pollen. Can't dismiss it … unless … uninstall",
            "No pollen count for today but its says its high not accurate!",
            "This ap helps me so much it allows me to find local pollen counts without looking all over the place! all three major allergens (trees, grasses and weeds) in one place. I love it! Also, you can set alerts, if the counts are above a level that you specify so you know when to stay inside and can plan accordingly for the day! As a patient with allergic asthma and a nanny to a little boy who also has allergic asthma I use this ap daily most months of the year.",
            "Does the job and well put-together, but I wish it let me look at forecasts for other [saveable] locations without changing what location I get notifications for. A 1x1 status widget would be really cool too. ETA: keeps crashing on my Samsung s10e :'("

I'll keep using it for now since it's the closest thing to what I was looking for.",
            "I like the app but it is lacking functions. For example, it seems like it's not possible to change days on the calendar to add food on a different day (I forgot to log my dinner yesterday and it just goes under today). If the function is there please let me know where xD I would also like to see a time for logging food. The mood logging is also not super clear. App with a potential but need some work, I will gladly change my feedback if it improves :)",

        "description": "Seasonal allergies, sometimes called \"hay fever\" or seasonal allergic rhinitis, are allergy symptoms that happen during certain times of the year, usually when outdoor molds release their spores, and trees, grasses, and weeds release tiny pollen particles into the air to fertilize other plants.\r\nThe immune systems of people who are allergic to mold spores or pollen treat these particles (called allergens) as invaders and release chemicals, including histamine, into the bloodstream to defend against them. It's the release of these chemicals that causes allergy symptoms.\r\nPeople can be allergic to one or more types of pollen or mold. The type someone is allergic to determines when symptoms happen. For example, in the mid-Atlantic states, tree pollination is February through May, grass pollen runs from May through June, and weed pollen is from August through October — so kids with these allergies are likely to have increased symptoms at those times. Mold spores tend to peak midsummer through the fall, depending on location.\r\nEven kids who have never had seasonal allergies in years past can develop them. Seasonal allergies can start at almost any age, though they usually develop by the time someone is 10 years old and reach their peak in the early twenties, with symptoms often disappearing later in adulthood.\r\nSeasonal allergies examples: Spring Allergies, Summer Allergies, Fall Allergies, Winter Allergies, Hay Fever, Pollen Allergies, Mold Allergy, Dust Allergy, Dog Allergy, Cat Allergy, allergy and asthma and allergic reaction rash.\r\nSeasonal allergies App Features:\r\n•\tWhat is Seasonal Allergies? \r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Symptoms.\r\n•\tHow to Control Your Seasonal Allergies.\r\n•\tNatural Seasonal Allergy Home Remedies.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Causes.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Diagnosis.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Treatment.",

            "Best app I found for seeing if certain foods will aggravate my food sensitivities without having to scan every goddamned label and look everything up myself. Could stand to be fleshed out a bit more, but a great tool nonetheless.",
            "This is a very addictive sites to look at ingredients but no longer possible to use it on browser unless you just browse by the category only but good to look at nutrition fact.",
            "I began using this app when my doctor recommended I do the low fodmap diet for 6 weeks. I thought this would make shopping for specific foods a lot easier. Boy, was I wrong. It is not accurate when you scan items in the store. For example, I would scan items, and it would say to avoid this item because of a certain ingredient in it, like soy. I would then look at the ingredients on the product and nowhere would it be listed. I would not recommend this app.",
            "So far so good! My only suggestion would be to add a filter menu to searches / scanned items / lists, which provides options for sorting by food groups, brands, descending/ascending number rating, and excellent, good, poor, etc. matches only. As it is, looking through lists and searches is a nightmare when you have a LOT of items to look through. Another helpful feature would be to add an option to filter out duplicate items in searches--I once had a search give me 10+ dupes for several items.",
            "I was reluntant at first to try this app due to a lot of negative reviews and comments. I just found out some food allergies that is includes in lots of foods, such as wheat, and this app is a good help. It also helps with other ingredients you want to avoid, such as sugar, etc. It even shows you foods that will be good for you to choose that disclides everything, which is good for someone new to a bad allergy trying to find new foods to eat. So far, I love this app"

        "description": "Your immune system is responsible for defending the body against bacteria and viruses. In some cases, your immune system  will defend against substances that typically don’t pose a threat to the human body. These substances are known as allergens, and when your body reacts to them, it causes an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\nYou can inhale, eat, and touch allergens that cause a reaction. Doctors can also use allergens to diagnose allergies and can even inject them into your body as a form of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary from mild to severe. If you become exposed to an allergen for the first time, your symptoms may be mild. These symptoms may get worse if you repeatedly come into contact with the allergen.\r\n\r\nFor allergy sufferers, the best treatment is to avoid the offending allergens altogether. This may be possible if the allergen is a specific food, like peanuts, which can be cut out of the diet, but not when the very air we breathe is loaded with allergens, such as ragweed pollen. Various over-the-counter or prescription medications can relieve symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Antihistamines. These medications counter the effects of histamine, the substance that makes eyes water and noses itch and causes sneezing during allergic reactions. Sleepiness was a problem with the oldest antihistamines, but the newest drugs do not cause such a problem.\r\n\r\n- Nasal steroids. These anti-inflammatory sprays help decrease inflammation, swelling, and mucus production. They work well alone and, for some people, in combination with antihistamines; in recommended doses, they are relatively free of side effects.\r\n\r\n- Cromolyn sodium. A nasal spray, cromolyn sodium can help stop hay fever, perhaps by blocking release of histamine and other symptom-producing chemicals. It has few side effects.\r\n\r\n- Decongestants. Available in capsule and spray form, decongestants may reduce swelling and sinus discomfort. Intended for short-term use, they are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Long-term usage of spray decongestants can actually make symptoms worse, while decongestant pills do not have this problem.\r\n\r\n- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) might provide relief for patients who don't find relief with antihistamines or nasal steroids. Allergy shots alter the body's immune response to allergens, thereby helping to prevent allergic reactions. They are the only form of treatment that can induce long-lasting protection for several years after therapy is stopped. Current immunotherapy treatments are limited because of potential allergic reactions; rarely, these can be severe.\r\n\r\nDownload this Allergic Reaction Treatment now for get more info.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",
        "descriptionHTML": "Your immune system is responsible for defending the body against bacteria and viruses. In some cases, your immune system  will defend against substances that typically don’t pose a threat to the human body. These substances are known as allergens, and when your body reacts to them, it causes an allergic reaction.<br><br>You can inhale, eat, and touch allergens that cause a reaction. Doctors can also use allergens to diagnose allergies and can even inject them into your body as a form of treatment.<br><br>The symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary from mild to severe. If you become exposed to an allergen for the first time, your symptoms may be mild. These symptoms may get worse if you repeatedly come into contact with the allergen.<br><br>For allergy sufferers, the best treatment is to avoid the offending allergens altogether. This may be possible if the allergen is a specific food, like peanuts, which can be cut out of the diet, but not when the very air we breathe is loaded with allergens, such as ragweed pollen. Various over-the-counter or prescription medications can relieve symptoms.<br><br>- Antihistamines.

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

It is offered \"as is\", and most likely no further updates will be released.***\r\n\r\nThe heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry, to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour, day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as \"Notes\" in to the diary.\r\n\r\nEntering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item, symptom, or note that you enter into the diary, so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable.\r\n\r\nOnce you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms, the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which, after consumption, may have either a short or a long \"incubation period\" before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health.\r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates, and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet.\r\n\r\nPaying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts, and allows you access to the \"Backup/Restore Diary\" feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file, move that file to a new device, and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device.\r\n\r\nThis app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. \r\n-- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.\r\n-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific \"IntoleranceFoodDiary\" folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.\r\n-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.\r\n\r\nAll data entered into this app is stored locally on your device.

            "It's very easy to use. Used it for several months now. One thing that could be improved a lot is the analysis of possible intolerances. For example: - It seems the app just tells me what foods I've eaten X hours before the symptom. And obviously the results are just useless. - Add some kind of real correlation analisys between food and symptom occurrences in time that are chosen manually. - At least add a graph between food and symptom occurrences for easy visual comparison.",
            "I really like it's simplicity and you also have the option to receive the summary via email. I had this app back in 2018 when I was eliminating sugar in my body. Deleted it in early 2019 when I became underweight again. But now December 2019, I want to keep track of the food I eat again. So happy to find this for the second time around. This is exactly the app I was looking for. Thank you!",
            "THANK YOU for developing this app. Am finding it a very useful awareness-building and self-training tool. Easy to use. I like it a lot! PS: don't rely on the 'Find intolerences' function though - the algorithm needs a lot of work in order to be useful.",
            "Easy to use. Works well. I'm not sure why we must select \"lunch\" or \"dinner\" etc before entering foods eaten. It's all just food .. Eaten at whatever time it was eaten. This not only requires an extra click, it causes problems if you enter two lunches or dinners in the same day. If that problem we're addressed ... And maybe a better looking and more optimized interface, I would give 5 stars. But I do really like it and it's the best I've found on Android.",
            "Been using for a year and I love it, but it could use a \"search\" feature, for when you want to find the last time you ate ice cream and how it effected you. Right now you have to scroll and find \"ice cream\" through months of entries. Otherwise it's a great app I use all day every day."

            "I really liked this app until I had a salicylate reaction after I bought cranberry juice because they have it listed as green for salicylates, but it's actually Very High Salicylate. The wikipedia link they provided had no mention of the salicylate content of cranberries. It wasn't until I searched it further on reliable allergy sites that I came across it repeatedly marked as VHS. Very disappointed.",
            "The app you've always needed!!! Let's you add multiple intolerances and visually colors them to help you see what you can and can't eat. Easy to update tolerances for multiple people. So simple love it!",
            "Would be nice to filter only green/yellow+green categories and maybe save that filter. It would help to find out which type of foods aren't working for me and causing me issues. I think it's histamines but not sure yet.",
            "I'm glad I decided to spend a little bit of money to buy this app. The food database is very big, the filter options work great and the info is solid. The only places where I saw inconsistencies with other sources are actually current subjects of debate in the scientific community so it seems like the creators did a very good job compiling the info. The only slight beef I have with the app is that it's not very appealing to the eye but the simplicity of the UI is great!"

At first I didn't understand why, but after I compared Sensio's forecasts with those from other allergy tracking sources in my area, I found out that Sensio had been saying allergens were very low, when they weren't. Don't count on this app.",
            "Useless and inaccurate, unfortunately. The app is intended to work with the (generally unavailable) monitoring devices sold by the company, but it seems to be linked to a monitor next to a coal furnace, since it 's always indicating dangerously high levels of particulate pollution.",
            "The idea is benefecial but there is a problem with Lebanon for example. The application gives a number of choices (Beirut, horsh, kaslik, ...) but they have been the same numbers and description for 3 days. No update for Lebanon, why is it included then? I checked for 2 European and North American cities and the info has been daily updated. Another issue, there is Israel with its capital Jerusalem! No other neighboring Arab states: Egypt, Jordan, Palestine... except UAE.",
            "This app is wonderful. I only gave 4 stars because I wish it was a bit more detailed, as in what kind of tree pollen and the individual levels for each tree being pick up in the air so I can better determine which one is triggering my symptoms."

I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",

I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",

Rather than pay monthly you can also pay a one time amount of $19.99 to get a full year access. That one time $19.99 is equal to $1.67 per month.

        "title": "Allergic Reaction Treatment And Symptoms",
        "description": "Allergies are hypersensitive responses from the immune system to substances that either enter or come into contact with the body. These substances are known as allergens, and when your body reacts to them, it causes an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\nThese substances commonly include materials such as pet dander, pollen, or bee venom. Anything can be an allergen if the immune system has an adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nA substance that causes an allergic reaction is called an allergen. Allergens can be found in food, drinks, or the environment.\r\n\r\nMany allergens are harmless and do not affect most people.\r\n\r\nIf a person is allergic to a substance, such as pollen, their immune system reacts to the substance as if it was foreign and harmful, and tries to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary from mild to severe. If you become exposed to an allergen for the first time, your symptoms may be mild. These symptoms may get worse if you repeatedly come into contact with the allergen.\r\n\r\nFor allergy sufferers, the best treatment is to avoid the offending allergens altogether. This may be possible if the allergen is a specific food, like peanuts, which can be cut out of the diet, but not when the very air we breathe is loaded with allergens, such as ragweed pollen. Various over-the-counter or prescription medications can relieve symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Antihistamines. These medications counter the effects of histamine, the substance that makes eyes water and noses itch and causes sneezing during allergic reactions. Sleepiness was a problem with the oldest antihistamines, but the newest drugs do not cause such a problem.\r\n\r\n- Nasal steroids. These anti-inflammatory sprays help decrease inflammation, swelling, and mucus production. They work well alone and, for some people, in combination with antihistamines; in recommended doses, they are relatively free of side effects.\r\n\r\n- Cromolyn sodium. A nasal spray, cromolyn sodium can help stop hay fever, perhaps by blocking release of histamine and other symptom-producing chemicals. It has few side effects.\r\n\r\n- Decongestants. Available in capsule and spray form, decongestants may reduce swelling and sinus discomfort. Intended for short-term use, they are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Long-term usage of spray decongestants can actually make symptoms worse, while decongestant pills do not have this problem.\r\n\r\n- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) might provide relief for patients who don't find relief with antihistamines or nasal steroids. Allergy shots alter the body's immune response to allergens, thereby helping to prevent allergic reactions. They are the only form of treatment that can induce long-lasting protection for several years after therapy is stopped. Current immunotherapy treatments are limited because of potential allergic reactions; rarely, these can be severe.\r\n\r\nDownload this Allergic Reaction Treatment And Symptoms app now for get more info.\r\n\r\nYou may search : Seasonal allergies, Food allergies symptoms, Milk allergy, Seasonal allergies symptoms, Allergic reaction, Eye allergies, Best allergy medicine, Food allergies, Allergy symptoms, Allergic reaction symptoms\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post. \r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

Sleepiness was a problem with the oldest antihistamines, but the newest drugs do not cause such a problem.<br><br>- Nasal steroids. These anti-inflammatory sprays help decrease inflammation, swelling, and mucus production. They work well alone and, for some people, in combination with antihistamines; in recommended doses, they are relatively free of side effects.<br><br>- Cromolyn sodium. A nasal spray, cromolyn sodium can help stop hay fever, perhaps by blocking release of histamine and other symptom-producing chemicals. It has few side effects.<br><br>- Decongestants. Available in capsule and spray form, decongestants may reduce swelling and sinus discomfort. Intended for short-term use, they are usually used in combination with antihistamines. Long-term usage of spray decongestants can actually make symptoms worse, while decongestant pills do not have this problem.<br><br>- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) might provide relief for patients who don&#39;t find relief with antihistamines or nasal steroids. Allergy shots alter the body&#39;s immune response to allergens, thereby helping to prevent allergic reactions. They are the only form of treatment that can induce long-lasting protection for several years after therapy is stopped. Current immunotherapy treatments are limited because of potential allergic reactions; rarely, these can be severe.<br><br>Download this Allergic Reaction Treatment And Symptoms app now for get more info.<br><br>You may search : Seasonal allergies, Food allergies symptoms, Milk allergy, Seasonal allergies symptoms, Allergic reaction, Eye allergies, Best allergy medicine, Food allergies, Allergy symptoms, Allergic reaction symptoms<br><br>This application features are :-<br><br>You can bookmark Favorite articles(post)<br><br>This application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click &#39;Read Article&#39; button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).<br><br>You can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.<br><br>You can copy the text from any post. <br><br>You can enable notification<br><br>You can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

Most often the product is in the database, but if not, it's easy to send a picture in, and it's quickly added. My teen daughter and her friends have it also, it's educational and great if they're out shopping on their own and want healthy snacks.",

But what about the safety of other common additives such as propyl gallate or sodium nitrate? \r\n\r\nIntroducing Ingredian, the food scanner. Ingredian uses your phone's camera to scan ingredient label text for quickly detecting additives and other potentially harmful chemicals lurking in your food. All detected ingredients are sorted in order by category with web links that provide additional information about each one. \r\n\r\nIngredian can also assist in detecting allergens such as eggs, dairy, fish, nuts, soy and wheat.  The Ingredian Pro paid version supports an Alpha-gal diet, i.e., red meat allergy diet. \r\n\r\nThis app scans ingredient label text on the product container.  Similar apps scan bar codes, which are frequently out of date or missing entirely from the connected server's database.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n   ✔ Ingredient categories: Allergens, Anti-caking agents, Anti-foaming agents, Bleaching agents, Buffering agents, Colorings, Countries of origin, Emulsifiers, Enzymes, Flavorings, Miscellaneous, Nutrients, Oils, Preservatives, Solvents, Spices/Herbs, Stabilizers & Sweeteners\r\n   ✔ Diets supported: Dairy-free, Fish-free, Gluten-free, Nut-free, Vegan & Vegetarian\r\n   ✔ Performs fast real-time scans - No need to crop a picture and wait for results\r\n   ✔ Supports scanning of large labels such as found on frozen pizza boxes\r\n   ✔ Ingredients are detected by the device with no server intervention\r\n   ✔ Detected ingredients scroll across the screen for quick review\r\n   ✔ Detects country of origin when listed on the ingredients label\r\n   ✔ Supports customization of detectable ingredients and diets\r\n   ✔ Camera Zoom option for setting initial zoom from 0 - 100% \r\n   ✔ Speech Synthesizer option to speak ingredients detected\r\n   ✔ Detects over 300 allergens from Abalone to Zucchini\r\n   ✔ Web links to food safety gov and nutrition info sites\r\n   ✔ Scan Accuracy options: Good, Better & Best \r\n   ✔ Scan Mode options: Automatic & Manual\r\n   ✔ Camera Flash option for use in low light\r\n   ✔ Unlimited number of scans permitted\r\n   ✔ High-contrasting user interface\r\n   ✔ Minimal permissions required\r\n   ✔ Low power consumption\r\n   ✔ Show diet compliancies\r\n   ✔ Small download size\r\n \r\nThis app is free with no data tracking and no required user sign-in.

        "description": "Allergic Reaction Treatment is An allergy and some types of allergic reactions may only cause mild discomfort, such as mild seasonal hay fever that can be controlled with over-the counter medicines or with no treatment at all. A more severe allergy can interfere with your life, reduce your enjoyment in activities, and become fatal. If this is the case, you should see a doctor for a comprehensive review and allergy testing.\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nallergy treatment\r\nallergies\r\nallergy medicine\r\nallergy testing\r\nbest allergy medicine\r\nfood intolerance test\r\nallergy\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about Allergic Reaction Treatment: \r\n\r\nThe body reacts to the release of the antibodies in various ways. Allergic reactions can attack any part of our body. They can attack the stomach, the nose, throat, sinuses, and lungs. Some of the allergic reactions your body might experience is nasal stuffiness, discharge, sneezing and itchy nose. Sometimes a reaction is accompanied by other symptoms such as itching in the ears or roof of the mouth.\r\n\r\nDuring an outbreak of common allergic reactions, eyes can be affected with conjunctivitis or red, itchy, and watery eyes. An allergen can make the skin appear to be red, itchy, and dry, hives or itchy welts as well. Asthma is among the common forms of allergic reactions. Asthma causes shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing. Asthma can become severe depending on the allergic reactions to a particular allergen.\r\n\r\nSeveral substances can cause allergic reactions. In fact, there are hundreds, but the most common allergens are:\r\n\r\n* Pollen. We can hardly avoid pollen if we spend any time outdoors at all.\r\n* Mold. Molds can be anywhere and in your home without you realizing it.\r\n* Dust. Household dusts and dust mites are inevitable in most homes.\r\n* Animals. Dander, urine, and oil from their skin can even become an allergen with varying allergic reactions.\r\n* Chemicals. Industrial chemicals commonly in household cleaners.\r\n* Food. A peanut allergy which can often be life threatening are actually pretty common.\r\n* Feathers. Some birds produce a powder to aid in preening, some produce so much they can coat nearby surfaces.\r\n* Insect Stings. A bee sting can sometimes be fatal.\r\n* Cockroaches and the waste they produce.\r\n\r\nAny race, age, gender, or social status can be affected by allergies. Allergic reactions seem to be more common in children but an adult can suffer any of these allergic reactions as well, even after years of remission. Allergic reactions can run in families even though it isn't yet understood why that happens. A specific allergy is not usually inherited, but a tendency to develop allergies is often passed down. If both parents have allergies, the child is likely to have allergies. However, the chance of developing allergies seems to be greater if the mother has allergies. An allergy can develop gradually over a period of time and can be caused by hormonal changes, stress, perfume, smoking, and other substances in the environment.\r\n\r\nYou can discover what allergy you have in one of two ways. The first is to have a blood test that measures the antibodies to a specific allergy sample and the other is the skin patch test method. Several well-known allergens are diluted and either injected into the skin or a small amount is place under the skin by a puncture or scratch. If a welt or red area appears on the skin it might mean the patient is allergic to that allergen.\r\n\r\nTreatments for allergy prone people may vary and are determined on your age, overall health, and medical history. Consideration will be given when deciding therapy options based on how bad the allergic reactions are and your tolerance of medications, as well as personal preferences. Occasionally a person may only need to change their lifestyle and take extra precautions that their home is dust and mold free.",

The time of day is just as important as the date itself and a pretty standard question providers ask when asking patients about their symptoms. I have to keep a time and date log while wearing a heart monitor so they can correlate the two but I don't see how to do that. I will be requesting a refund.",
            "The app is quite good but you need to add more functions and more details, add stuff that would keep your customers motivated to use it. E.g if you use the app and enter data you have an animal that grows as you enter data every day. Once that animal grows you get another animal or plant or a garden or something that you'd care for while caring for yourself.",

            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

I particularly like seeing the year over year trends for things like strep throat, the common cold and flu! Another great feature is the \"Get Smart\" section. Here there are short videos on different illnesses and remedies. The one on elderberry was interesting because I have always been weary of it. Overall, i think this app is pretty interesting! #momclt #sponsored",
            "This app is very easy to use. Amazing information regarding illnesses around me. It also allows you to check time waits for urgent care or even schedule a video appointment with a doctor. Shows on the map what area codes have reported certain illnesses. Aside from all that there is also news information. Hands down, very informative!",
            "This easy to use and free app is great for all families. I love how I can get real time updates on illnesses, allergies, and other sicknesses going around in my area. As a mom of 3 young children this is a great tool to have. I can track my family's symptoms, schedule an office visit and check wait times at emergency rooms. I definitely recommend this app to all of my family and friends. #sponsored #momclt",
            "Interesting info about what germs are going around. The most beneficial part for me are the doctors notes that give tips on what to do if you have some of the most common conditions, as well as the charts of prevalance year after year. It may also be useful when going on vacation, to see what may be around the area. #momclt #sponsored"

            "I really like the app and I love the idea of it, but it needs some work. The scanning feature is wonderful! I'm not sure why you can submit some products for review, but not others. The camera never gets a clear picture of the ingredients. So I'm submitting many products, but getting emails saying they can't read the ingredients. My phone camera works fine and is always clear. Also the zoom is off. Its starts out like a far away fishbowl mode and when you zoom in it never focuses properly.",
            "What an absolute waste of time, this app could be brilliant, but it's buggy, clumsy & frustrating. I don't have time to keep logging in everytime I use the app, if & when it decides to recognise my login details. Really, there aren't enough words to describe how this app just misses the mark at every turn.",
            "This app is helpful for basic skin sensitivity tracking, but may be difficult for those who, like me, have 5+ different chemical contact allergies (each of which usually has more than one name, making tracking or memorization hard). Was hoping to use this app to help me steer clear of products I may be allergic to, but you apparently need a Personal Allergen Code for this. And unless your doctor subscribes to this app and gives you a PAC, you can't get one or make a list on your own. :/",
            "Omg one of the most useless apps I've ever had. Such a BRILLIANT idea, but lacks information, range of products. You don't have L'oreal?? Come on seriously? Can't input your allergens without a doctor. Unable to upload a picture of a product as its so blurry you're unable to read the ingredients. You're sitting on a amazing idea. But that's all it is. No sense of efficiency here. Don't bother downloading and wasting your time.",
            "This app lets you search a database of almost 50,000 products to choose products that are free of allergens or unhealthy additives. Great if you have sensitive skin but can't afford to buy high-end products all the time. There are almost always a couple of very affordable products that score just as well as the expensive ones for being free of bad additives."

            "Much more than I expected. Very intuitive interface for learning quite a bit about the air quality. I've been using this for a month or so and pleased with the functionality, information and format. I'll give it 5 stars when I see an accurate forecast for poor air. So far it's been accurate for current air which of course is only moderately useful. This app leads into an ecosystem of products which they endorse and or make and market themselves. I'm considering buying a node to contribute.",
            "Wow, great air quality index (AQI) app. It's got a nice design, easy user interface, quick to understand and showing all important information in a digestible way. You can also keep track of your pollution exposure. The satellite map modelling pollution distribution is pretty high profile! What needs improvement is that the app should mention which standard is used, PM2.5 or PM10, which is most important. It's hidden in the option \"display main pollutant\".",
            "This app has been amazing when looking at the air quality outdoors in a snap! I would like to see more updates to the widgets, because the little and small widgets don't have a refresh button, so you can manually refresh the air quality number and see if it changed, but this app doesn't have that. Some more widget sizes and different designs would be great as well, but there are five already you can choose from. If you guys add the manual refresh button feature I will change my star rating to 5.",
            "I use this app daily as I live in a city with variable air quality and want to make sure my outside exercise time is spent in decent air. However, the map in the recent update is extremely poor: The +- option for zooming in has been removed which makes it more awkward to use. The map graphics are now terrible. It's hard to determine landmarks and zoom into the correct region of the map. Rivers are almost invisible and the grey background is a bad contrast making it harder to read.",
            "The app has gone downhill since the last Android update. Visual elements are low contrast and difficult to read. City names are tiny. Support is non-existent and ignores user feedback. Also, IQAir is taking Purple Air data but not validating it. During wildfires, it was obvious that indoor locations were being reported as outdoor locations because there was such a difference in their AQI readings vs other outdoor locations. Neither company would QC or clean up the data."

The most common reactions are with the skin or air, animals, food or similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou probably have heard for them before and talk with other people about them, what are they, how you get them and how to treat them.\r\nAllergies are also called and Type I Hypersentivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are malfunction of the human immune system and they are causing the state of the body, known as hypersensitized. Body reacts immunologically to non-immunogenic substances, which are also cause of the body state which is known as allergens.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first term come in the 1906, from Clemens von Pirguet, Viennese pediatrician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms and First Signs of Allergies\r\n\r\nThe presence of the allergens may cause systemic or local inflammatory response. Usually, when you feel swelling in the parts of your body, you know that it's starting up with allergies. This first symptom is also known as systemic inflammatory response or also, local inflammatory response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are allergic on the animal hear you will have allergies in the nose, which will include swelling of the nasal mucosa. This is also known as allergic rhinitis. Because of itch in your nose you will very often wipe your nose, more than it is necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen your eyes are irritated as reaction of the allergies, symptoms such as itching of conjunctiva and redness are the most often. There are and other signs of allergies such as bronchoconstriction or even sometimes and outright attacts of asthma, dyspnoea and other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also important to mention that allergies may also cause and bronchoconstriction, edema, coma, hypotension, cutaenouse or in the worst cases death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most usual allergies that caused with the airborne pollen is allergies on the pollen with the symptoms of hay fever. This type of allergies usually is starting up in the early spring or also in the early autumn. At last, depending of factors, allergies may also be caused by medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons Why People Are Getting Allergies\r\n\r\nThe most important for healthy of all people is immune system. Immune system is actually, your bio-weapon which protects your body from all diseases that are attacking your body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mechanism may identify foreign invaders and in same time also destroy them. Still, sometimes it could happen that this mechanism, immune system, makes some mistakes which cause allergies. These allergies are results of hypersensitive immune system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that hypersensitive immune system, makes mistakes, so it identifies innocuous substances as bad and dangerous for the body and as results of that, immune system starts with attack to the substances with high level of ferocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally result of all this is problems that may be ranged from mildly inconvenient to the uncomfortable feeling. At last the worst result it total failure of the organs in your body. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHypersensitized State And How Does Your Immune System Comes Into It\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more doctrines about how immune system goes into a hypersensitized state. The most logical explanation is that allergies are connected with genetic codes and that they always caused by protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, white blood cells usually are not able to make differences between proteins which are threatening and those which are non-threatening. ",

            "Nice app. Have used it for years now. Needed some as I have many heart issues. The only problem I have found is that responses list for organ donor. I not an organ donor do to the meds and health issues. The third option reads ( I refuse to donate my organs. ) there should be a response that reads simply, I am not an organ donor.",
            "First of all, congrats on being featured in the Google Play Store. I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",
            "Having had this exelant app for a good time i have found a problem that i am unable to solve. I changed the lock screen banner to the middle of the screen , it now blocks the keypad numbers and i am unable to access the phone. I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",
            "I've only had this app two or three days, but suddenly I'm charging my phone about every eight (8) hours, instead of every two or three days!! This app draws way too much power from my battery, therefore I have to delete it. This makes me sorry, because I REALLY liked the way the app is set up and the info it contains.",
            "I love the app for my phone! It's helpful to have in case I have a seizure (im epileptic) in public! The only problem I have is I recently got a smartwatch, and I don't think there's any compatibility with it. A little annoying that I can't have most of my information on me in case I forget my phone."

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

The term Allergy free - refers to the recipes in the App that are Milk Free, Nuts Free, Eggs Free and Free from Diary by-products.\r\n\r\nIn this 'Allergy Free Pie Recipes App', there are great recipes for Pies, Crisps, Shakes. Smoothies, Candies—foods that are usually a big taboo for those with food allergies. Eating these types of foods at restaurants or bakeries is often out of the question, but my versions of these items are so good, you won’t be able to tell they’re completely dairy, egg, and nut-free. These are dishes you and your family can turn to again and again. \r\n\r\nPies are probably one of the most allergy-friendly desserts you can create. Make a great pie crust with dairy-free shortening and fill it with a variety of enticing options. There are no limits to what pie can do for you.

Approximately one in four people gets urticaria in the course of her or his life. Urticaria is characterized by the sudden onset of itchy wheals and/or angioedema. The skin of the entire body or only a portion may be affected. In their appearance, these bumps resemble the skin swelling induced by the stinging hairs of nettle (Lat. Urtica dioica).\r\nThe most important step is to identify the triggers and determine the individual threshold. Then, the trigger must be avoided to the extent this is possible.

Approximately one in four people gets urticaria in the course of her or his life. Urticaria is characterized by the sudden onset of itchy wheals and/or angioedema. The skin of the entire body or only a portion may be affected. In their appearance, these bumps resemble the skin swelling induced by the stinging hairs of nettle (Lat. Urtica dioica).<br>The most important step is to identify the triggers and determine the individual threshold. Then, the trigger must be avoided to the extent this is possible.

        "description": "Allergena Zones 1-9 are designed to combat the most allergenic trees, weeds & grasses in your area. What ails someone in New York (Zone 2) is not the same as what discomforts a fellow in Houston (Zone 5). The triggers are different; thus the remedies must be different.  \r\n\r\nHOW DOES ALLERGENA WORK?  \r\nThe immune system defends us against disease. When harmful substances are detected, such as pollens, the immune system must create antibodies. Allergena is a homeopathic formula of antigens (i.e. tree, weed and grass species) that are introduced to the body to stimulate the creation of appropriate antibodies. These antibodies will than destroy or neutralize pollens (AND/OR dust, mold) that are causing your allergic reactions. Allergena products include Allergena Zone 1-9, Mold Mix, Dust+Mite, Pet Dander, Fragrance. We even have Allergena for Pets! \r\n\r\nOur homeopathic allergy drops use radically diluted and succussed substances that they are able to gently induce the desired response in the individual and promote overall health without overloading the immune system. Allergena teaches the body to build immunity by giving micro doses of what a person is allergic to so the body becomes safely conditioned to tolerate those allergens and reduce allergic symptoms. \r\n\r\nWHY HOMEOPATHY? \r\nHomeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Homeopathic practitioners treat illness in a way that intends to facilitate a natural healing of the individual at the most elemental level, and as gently as possible, by using infinitesimally minute doses (often imperceptible to the microscope) of a substance. The way a practitioner chooses a remedy is via the principle of \"like cures like.\" In other words, something that causes symptoms in a healthy person can – in very small doses – treat the symptoms. Tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals are used to stimulate the healing process. It is a practice that was esteemed as far back as Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine. \r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE KIDS FORMULAS? \r\nKids formulas have the same active ingredients as the adult formulas. The Kids formulas are in a base of glycerin that tastes sweet. The adult formulas are in a base of alcohol. Kids formulas are an excellent alternative to those wanting to avoid alcohol. \r\n\r\nWHY ARE THERE HERBAL DRAINAGE REMEDIES IN THE FORMULA? \r\nDrainage remedies assist your body in opening up drainage routes to allow the discharge of toxic substances which may have accumulated. Elimination of these toxins can promote an ease of recovery from the effects of allergies.   \r\n\r\nFOLLOWING DIRECTIONS IS CRITICAL. \r\nConsider this idea: Allergena formulas are \"teaching\" your body to build antibodies. Keeping the formula in your system throughout the day ensures that the proper \"tools\" are present to create the antibodies necessary to reduce allergies.  \r\n\r\nHOW DO I TAKE ALLERGENA? \r\nFrequent administration of Allergena is essential to building immunity. Recommended dosage for adults is 10-15 drops under the tongue, 3 times daily. Children (age 2-12), 6-10 drops under the tongue, 3 times daily, before or after meals. Allow drops to be absorbed orally, then swallow.  Acute allergy attack: Administer 5-8 drops per hour, in addition to 3 times daily.  \r\n\r\nSEVERE AND LONG TERM ALLERGIES? \r\nPre-Season: Begin Allergena 1-2 weeks before the allergy season at a recommended dosage of 6 drops under the tongue, 3 times daily. During Allergy Season: Increase to your recommended dosage. Post-Season: For best results, reduce your recommended dosage to 5-8 drops under the tongue once daily for the two weeks following the allergy season.  \r\n\r\nAllergena’s success began with health professionals across the US in early 1980. Consumer demand provided opportunity for Allergena to expand into retail health stores by the mid 1990’s. Today, it is available from health professionals, online, and throughout retail stores across the country.",

Dog allergies can be very frustrating for both yourself and your dog. The constant itching and scratching, paw licking and chewing, skin rashes or chronic ear infections can make life very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nDogs allergies become noticeable when your dog's immune system reacts excessively to substances (called allergens or antigens) to which she has been exposed. Generally, allergies show up in three ways. The most common is with the skin - your dog will itch and scratch either in one area or all over, or you will see skin sores or lesions. Another way involves the respiratory system and your dog may cough, sneeze, and/or wheeze, and there may be an associated nasal or eye discharge. A third type of allergic reaction involves the digestive system, when your dog vomits or has diarrhea.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of dog allergies. Conventionally, Veterinarians focus on five different types, but I have grouped them into three areas - these are the most common allergies you will see with your dog. The first is external allergies, and these include flea allergies; the second allergy group is with food; and the third is environmental, and this includes inhalant, from allergens such as pollens and house dust mites.\r\n\r\nDog allergies can be difficult to diagnose. Many of the symptoms you may see can be a result of allergies or of another illness. It is best to get your pet examined by your Veterinarian first, before trying any home or alternative dog allergies treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload Dog Allergies app now to read more..",

            "Didn't connect over BT. App is apparently just a way to get you on their mailing list and sell your data. You don't need location enabled to pair over BT, but this app *requires* it. And it doesn't control anything; it's just a record of your use. Stupid.",
            "the app seems non-responsive after returning the unit and purchasing a new one I realize that there is no provision in this app to change the serial number of your unit once you have registered it unless you open up a separate email account to do so which is unlikely that most purchasers will do that and continue to use it without an app running. the only reason I returned the first purchase is because scent pads were not available .",

            "What I felt is that for all drugs a doctor cannot remember its adverse effects and interactions with other drugs. This is a good base to help know interactions before prescribing any new drug. I recommend to use it. And I recommend the developers to include newer drugs also.",

            "So far this is excellent. I was recently diagnosed with depression and need to keep track of my symptoms as well as effects of medications. Most of the other apps have a pre-set list of symptoms, and user is limited to those symptoms. This app allows you to create your own labels for symptoms, so you can be very specific with tracking your health issues. Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",
            "I was searching for a log which seemed to be quite difficult until I found health log. You can add symptoms to the list, and pain levels. Just what I wanted.",
            "HELP option needed. It does everything I need so far. Had to read 100+ reviews to find developer comments to learn how to use, how to edit, etc. A \"how to/help\" in the dropdown menu is missing. Also, haven't yet figured out tracking >1 person. I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades. If full is just ad removal I'm ok with ads",
            "Good pain track and has a calendar view. Handy for a cancer patient like me. I haven't upgraded so far but i'll see in a few days when i need to backup.",
            "Really useful to track so I can keep my doctors up to date. However this morning when I went to sort categories it crashes everytime! EDIT: All fixed! Rating edited to 5 stars."

            "Very detailed and user friendly app. 1 of...if not THE best \"In Case of Emergency\" app available. Works great as a free app, and even better when purchased. Free app is still useful even without full features, I recommend this and having worked in the ambulance service I wish people would use or have this on their phones more often, saving time is saving lives, this app could one day do just that. Developer is also friendly, helpful and punctual with responding to questions or help.",
            "FORCED TO GIVE A 🌟. 😡 COMPLETELY USELESS APP...unless you only have one allergy, take only one prescription, no contacts...etc. As soon as you try to enter a second listing of anything, you get a pop-up about upgrading to (and paying for) the premium version. If you have only one medication or allergy & no emergency contacts...this is the app for you. However, if you live in the real world...pass this one by. Looking for the app I had on my old phone ..unlimited entrees & 100% free.",
            "ICE – In Case of Emergency, the name says it all. This is an incredibly awesome application! In case of any emergency situation, this application can be used as a medical contact card as well as it can also be useful to reach out to the emergency contacts if needed. It helps a lot and its literally Awesome!",
            "ICE - In Case of Emergency - Medical Contact Card is a very fabulous and amazing app. It is user friendly and easy to use. I like its all features mostly include Emergency Contacts and Medical Emergency Help. Brilliant app. This app is incredible! Thank you very much for your great service.",
            "Easy enough my 5 year old can now call mama for help with the screen locked. App serves it's main purpose well. Has potential for 5 star. -1 star because Ads are too often & aggressive. -1 star because Foreign languages are poorly implemented."

Like hello, I'm looking for a recipe to fit the couple of ingredients I want to use up and am *going to buy the other stuff I need*.I've used this app for years but it's extremely unhelpful now, will be looking for an alternative.",
            "App is pretty decent really like the way to have the pantry ready recipies section available. Wish you could add corresponding cookware, where you could add more types of recipes that require different types of tools and cookware. not everyone has a blender or cupcake pans available to them to make some recipes. it'd be nice for unexperienced cooks to have that option to know what to use to cook their food with.",
            "I do not like how you have to tap a button to get directions. I wish they were just done at the bottom of the recipe. I'm also having trouble getting the directions, it just says something like how they're having technical issues. I do really like how organized things are! And how aesthetically pleasing the app is",

It also includes useful features for tailored results, building recipe lists and of your in the right place, making a shopping list - although the auto-shopping features will not not work for me in Adelaide, South Australia.",
            "I love this app. Been a long-time Pinterest user, but there's just too much other stuff on Pinterest and I like the fact that I can find what I want and not have all the other junk come up too. Great job!"

            "Excellent app. Icon appears on lock page, double tap to open. No need to give out password or codes to unlock phone. Also once you add emergency contacts, the data will pull from your contact list for direct dialing...just tap the emergency contact name and phone dials them. Easy to use and has plenty of space in each category for allergies, med list, conditions, surgeries or other general useful information in the event of an emergency.",
            "This app is a 'lifesaver'!!! Seriously though, it really is. I have epilepsy absent seizures where I zone out into zombie mode, and this app has had all my medical info and my emergency contacts available for people around me twice, and has it there for any future incidents. Its simple to use, clear, and holds detailed info for medical services to draw upon. I've had issues with the emergency banner lock screen that annoyed me, but that's not to do with this app, more so android bullcrap.",
            "Extremely helpful app. Great for keeping track of all the medications I take. The medical personnel that have seen it all have appreciated it, and have given this app great compliments. They wished all people had it. Makes their job easier and faster.",
            "This app can be opened from my phone's locked screen, so an EMT could view my chronic conditions, meds, & drug allergies. I use the app to double-check my Rx list at every medical appointment. Very handy to have that feature.",
            "I put in all my info. Now every time I attempt to put a widget on my lock screen, the app keeps crashing."

        "description": "It is always hard to see your child get sick. But when our younger son, Ben, was just a few months old, he developed chronic eczema and began to lose weight. At five months, he had his first allergic reaction to his first taste of formula milk. It was clear he was ‘atopic’,\r\nhis little immune system was in overdrive and he seemed to be allergic to everything.\r\n\r\nWeaning, therefore, became an excruciatingly drawn-out and terrifying ordeal, requiring\r\nmilitary-style organisation. Because Ben might have an allergic reaction to any new food,\r\nwe learned early on to wait at least 48 hours after previous reactions. We had to pick\r\nmornings when his brother was in school, in case we needed to deal with ambulances and\r\nhospitals. We learned to touch the food to his lip first, to minimise the initial reaction. I\r\nkept an emergency hospital overnight bag ready by the front door for years – just in case.\r\n\r\nThe hospital’s nutritional advice, was well meant and helpful. But I was frustrated when\r\nthere didn’t appear to be a comprehensive list of simple recipes I could follow, that\r\nwould suit Ben’s particular needs. So, necessity being the mother of invention, I began\r\nexperimenting with our favourite family recipes. Our elder son, Sebastian, coined the\r\nname Hunter’s Pie, which was one of our first ‘combined’ family dishes that was\r\ncompletely ‘Ben friendly’.\r\n\r\nSo it was serendipitous that Chloe was willing to help me assemble some of the recipes into a format that might help other families in the same situation. Three years, and much hard work, time and frustration later, here it is - A collection of recipes which are completely free of dairy and egg products. We have also, where possible, tried to offer alternatives for gluten and nut ingredients too.\r\n\r\nI am proud to say that every single recipe photograph was taken by me just minutes before\r\nthe dish was served to the family. Chloe and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy the recipes\r\nas much as we have enjoyed discovering them.\r\n\r\nGinny Avery",

Was previously told that for oct but when called all evening appts were booked. This company is a joke!",

        "description": "SkyMD is a national telemedicine platform, specializing in dermatology, staffed with doctors that treat patients every day across America. With online dermatologists in all 50 US States, SkyMD's medical team of skin doctors is literally available to treat patients in every zip code, from infants to centenarians!\r\n\r\nOur online group of doctors operates no differently than any traditional doctor's office, other than no appointments, and your having more time to interact with your dermatologist. SkyMD accepts most medical insurances, and treats the privacy of your medical data with the utmost importance. Our medical professionals are all board certified doctors, with years of experience in treating a wide range of skin conditions and diseases.\r\n\r\nAs a group of practicing medical doctors, SkyMD also prescribes medications, the same as if you were evaluated by a doctor in person. Today's medical industry, along with State Boards of Medicine and the majority of private insurance networks, considers telemedicine as equal to being seen in person, and most medical insurance networks consider telemedicine as a covered medical benefit. Dermatology is an obvious and practical fit for the use of telemedicine. Your SkyMD doctor now has the flexibility to evaluate your uploaded photos, or converse with you in a video conference, or even recommend that you still see a doctor in person, depending on what's the right treatment model for each patient.\r\n\r\nAccess your dermatologist anytime, anywhere.

            "Update: There was a delay and I was able to get it to work. I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",
            "Great way to get prescriptions for issues already known to you. I'm sure they're helpful in diagnosing new issues as well. Definitely great for someone with a busy schedule.",
            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

            "Great App, can plan my day according to the Pollen Count.",
            "Don't use this app, there are better alternatives. The Air Rater app by the University of Tasmania is far better than Canberra Pollen because it contains more pollen types including Betula, Plantago, Alternaria, etc. Air Rater also allows you to track symptoms that will show you whether they align with certain pollens. Canberra Pollen's pollen count starts later, have a lower threshold score and frequently for the last several years rates pollen counts as 'Low' for the majority of the season.",
            "Canberras spring pollens begin late august early September. Need info earlier than October. Wattles and fruit blossoms are in full bloom by early September. All of allergy sufferers are well and truly sick by October rendering this app useless to us. The idea is good though. Bring the season forward and I'll reinstall. Cheers.",
            "Counting is meant to begin 1st Oct and end in December. It's 20th Oct now and the app says pollen season is over. Not very useful!",

        "description": "Hay fever is a common condition that affects close to 18 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Also known as allergic rhinitis or nasal allergies, hay fever can be seasonal, perennial (year-long), or occupational. Rhinitis refers to irritation or inflammation of the nose.\r\n\r\nHay fever is the term used for an allergy to pollen from plants, like grasses, trees, and weeds.\r\n\r\nYour GP can work out whether or not you have hay fever by talking to you about your symptoms (for example, sneezing, coughing, itchy eyes) and when they're worse. \r\n\r\nYou may be given a referral for a skin prick test and/or blood test to confirm which pollens set off your hay fever.\r\n\r\nMost people are diagnosed with hay fever in their teens or early 20s, but you can develop hay fever when you’re older too. It affects about one in five people in the UK.\r\n\r\nAround half of people report some improvement in symptoms after several years. And in around 10-20% of people, symptoms go away completely.\r\n\r\nSymptoms commonly include:\r\n\r\n- runny nose\r\n- nasal congestion\r\n- sneezing\r\n- watery, red, or itchy eyes\r\n- coughing\r\n- itchy throat or roof of the mouth\r\n- postnasal drip\r\n- itchy nose\r\n- sinus pressure and pain\r\n- itchy skin\r\n\r\nSymptoms may become long-term if hay fever is untreated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the symptoms of hay fever and the symptoms of a cold can feel similar, the biggest difference is that a cold will cause a fever and body aches. Treatments for both condition are also very different.\r\n\r\nHay fever is extremely common in children, though they rarely develop before 3 years of age. But it’s important to treat allergy symptoms, especially in infants and children. Serious hay fever symptoms can develop into long-term health conditions like asthma, sinusitis, or chronic ear infections. Recent studies show that genetics may indicate whether or not your child will develop asthma alongside hay fever.\r\n\r\nYounger children may have more trouble dealing with hay fever symptoms. It can affect their concentration and sleeping patterns. Sometimes the symptoms get confused with the common cold. But your child won’t have a fever like they might with the cold and the symptoms will persist beyond a few weeks.\r\n\r\nHay fever symptoms usually start right after you’re exposed to the allergen. Allergens can be indoors or outdoors seasonally or year-long.\r\n\r\nDownload this Hay Fever Treatment And Symptoms app now for get more info.\r\n\r\nThis application features are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends, family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

In 2009, the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology stated that one in every 12 people in the United States had a diagnosis of asthma, compared to one in 14 in 2001.  During an asthma attack, the muscles around the bronchial tubes tighten and swell, which narrows the air passages and thus makes it difficult for the person to breathe. Common triggers of asthma attacks include exposure to an allergen (like grass, tress, pollen, etc.), irritants in the air (such as smoke or strong smells), illnesses (like the flu), stress, extreme weather conditions (such as extreme heat), or physical exertion and exercise. \r\n\r\nLearning to recognize when you or someone else is having an asthma attack and knowing what to do can help save a life.\r\n\r\nIn this app, we explain how to recognize child with asthma, how to prevent asthma attacks, how to treat asthma, how to help someone with asthma attack as well as how to use an inhaler\r\n\r\nFeel free to send us  your questions or suggestions.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

It is caused by allergies against environmental allergies, such as pollen, house dust mites, moulds, etc. CAD accounts for around 60% of all allergies seen in dogs. It is characterised by a vicious cycle of inflammation, pruritus and excoriation, leading to repeated skin damage. \r\n\r\nCAD is difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis is based on excluding other causes of dermatitis, such as fleas, food allergy, etc. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI)-4 has been developed by leading veterinary dermatologists. With this scoring system the vet can see how serious the disease is, and once treated, measure the progress. It is also a very visual way to explain the situation and improvements to clients. \r\n\r\nManagement of patients with CAD is equally difficult, and often requires life-long multimodal management, including environmental modification, drugs, shampoos, topicals and specially formulated nutrition.  \r\n\r\n* References:\r\n1.

            "Gives you a comprehensive list and educates on the dangers of the ingredients. Did not locate some of my food items, but it did give the option to submit info to update their database.  **for those having scanning issues.... I also have barcode scanner installed and it works best when held at a distance of 6 to 12 inches.",
            "I'm in live with this app!!! IRS my new best friend. I learned today so much about GMOs and how that includes Gut Leak and BP and all sorts of other issues!!  I'm so disgusted by this and if I can't change the world at least I can change the way I eat so I can be healthy...  One thing about the app tho that annoys me and I'm not sure if i just need to redownload it but every time I look at an ingredient and try to get back to the main page it loads forever and freezes up...  besides that I LOVE IT",
            "First, the scanner issue is your problem, not the S4 Galaxy.  The S4 does attempt to auto-focus.  Scanner works great with My Fitness Pal. Second, I have already entered several UPC codes manually and none are in your database.  For a free app, no problem.  For a paid app...BIG problem. What will your excuse be when I get my S5 in the fall?",
            "I have a galaxy s7 and the scanner won't work. It keeps trying to auto focus on the bar code but can never achieve the goal. I know it's not the camera as other scanners work great. Not worth the money spent."

        "description": "Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a type of inflammation in the nose which occurs when the immune systemoverreacts to allergens in the air. Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. \r\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and typically do not include a fever. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hay Fever Guide, Hay Fever Disease Management & Hay Fever Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hay Fever Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I find the cair great for keeping an eye on air quality. Setup was easy enough and the app is intuitive. When it sends me an alert I can open the windows and watch it telling me how the air quality improves. I have it for a few weeks now and I think it is great value for money. Glad I bought one. Rory."

        "description": "Cause Of Asthma and how to cure, You may be wondering what the cause of asthma is, especially if you are keen to reduce the severity and frequency of your attacks. Asthma is a respiratory condition that can have an impact on the quality of your life. With an asthma attack, you feel weakened considerably and may not be able to function normally. However, instead of feeling helpless, find ways to better deal with it and to take responsibility for your own health.\r\n\r\nMore topics will be discuss in this app:\r\n\r\n- asthma symptoms\t\r\n- asthma treatment\t\r\n- asthma definition\r\n- asthma attack\r\n\r\nFeatures of the app:\r\n\r\nCan Use For Offline App\r\nUpdated regularly\r\nYou can ask questions to us for more idea about content.\r\nSimple app book Knowledge like pocket on your phone\r\nYou can also send us your suggestions and we will add them inside the app For more updates.\r\n\r\nRead more here about causes of asthma:\r\n\r\nYou must first realize that not all asthma is the same, in finding out what the cause of asthma is. Several different types of asthma have different triggers.\r\n\r\n- Allergic asthma is when the symptoms are triggered by allergens that the sufferer comes into contact with. Some of the most common triggers in allergic asthma are dust, pollen, pet dander, etc. An avoidance or reduced exposure to these triggers can help substantially. Most children who are diagnosed with asthma suffer from allergic asthma. Smoking during pregnancy and while children are young can make them more vulnerable to allergic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Exercise-induced asthma is when your asthma symptoms only occur during strenuous exercise. This asthma is due to the fact that the lungs lose their moisture and heat during times of strenuous activity. Coughing is the most common symptom observed with this type of asthma, although there may be more severe symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Intrinsic asthma is when the symptoms are not linked to a particular allergy. Some of the triggers in intrinsic asthma are perfume, smoke and cold air, cleaning fumes, an upper respiratory infection, and GERD or gastroesophageal reflux. Patients who begin having allergy symptoms after the age of 40 most often suffer from intrinsic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Occupational asthma occurs when you begin having asthma symptoms due to being in contact with dust, fumes, chemicals, or other irritants over a long period of time at work. This makes working very difficult. You may want to change your working environment for the sake of your health.\r\n\r\n- Nocturnal asthma occurs when you suffer from allergy symptoms while sleeping. It can be triggered by bedding allergens or other allergens located in your bedroom, GERD, or a decrease in the temperature of the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you learn more about your cause of asthma to determine how best to control or avoid your triggers. It is possible to lead a more normal life, free of the many miserable allergy symptoms, if you learn how to best take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nDownload causes of asthma app for learn more information.",

            "I would sugjest updating the blocking/reporting patt of the app. I want to be able to do more specific reports on the app. And for the blocking portion I wish to be able to block/unblock easier, have a list of the blocked profiles, and when someone is blocked their presense is hidden. I have a serious issue with one of your users harrassing/bulling me. I would love for her to leave the app or just at least not be able to find me.",
            "I like it so far. I do wish we could choose which of our diagnoses end up on our feed. My feed is swamped with depression posts, but I really just joined for support with PTSD. I still have depression, so I don't necessarily want to remove it from diagnoses, but I think I'll have to just so I can get the information I actually need.",
            "This app is overrun with spam, fake accounts, and people trying to scam others. There's also a number of people who are rude and abusive even though it's supposed to be a support app. Reporting people does nothing because the people are never removed even if several people report them several times each. And if someone harasses you in a DM there's no way to report it.",
            "very excited for this app to develop more with interface problems, everything else is perfect. i can't find a way to follow or even open people's community pages, so i'm pretty sure it's a glitch. hope it gets fixed ASAP as it really makes the app less useful.",
            "Whenever I try to create an account, everything goes fine until I have to upload a profile picture. Everytime I do, the app crashes and I have to start all over."
