Ex.: Under The Profile Picture it says, \"how are you feeling\", under that it says, \"condition update\". Well the date is correct, but the time is 4 hours behind. So once again, how do you change the time to be the exact time I input my info.🤔🤷🏻‍♀",

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

        "description": "eViralHepatitis Review is a no-cost CME program developed by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) in partnership with DKBmed. Expert insight and analysis providing information directly relevant to cystic fibrosis care, through topic-focused newsletters summarizing the peer-reviewed literature with accompanying podcasts to illustrate how to apply that information in the clinic.\r\n\r\nWhat clinicians are saying about eViralHepatitis Review:\r\n“Thank you for providing new, up-to-date information!”\r\n\r\n“Good variety of topics and the multiple presenters on a similar topic is AWESOME!”\r\n\r\n“I am now more thorough with evaluation for vasculitis.”\r\n\r\n“I now refer HCV+ patients for transplant of organs, if needed.”\r\n\r\n“Will incorporate new knowledge learned into my practice in treating with clients affected by hepatitis B.” \r\n\r\neViralHepatitis Review is part of the highly successful eLiterature Review series.

In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors among others. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase.

        "title": "Amazing Foods to Heal Your Pancreas Quicker",
        "description": "The pancreas is about 6 inches long and sits across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body.\r\n\r\n            Pancreas Conditions\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 1: The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the pancreas’ insulin-producing cells. Lifelong insulin injections are required to control blood sugar.\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 2: The pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. The body also becomes resistant to insulin, and blood sugar rises.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, usually including the lungs and the pancreas. Digestive problems and diabetes often result.\r\nPancreatic cancer: The pancreas has many different types of cells, each of which can give rise to a different type of tumor. The most common type arises from the cells that line the pancreatic duct. Because there are usually few or no early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is often advanced by the time it’s discovered.\r\n\r\nPancreatitis: The pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged by its own digestive chemicals. Swelling and death of tissue of the pancreas can result. Although alcohol or gallstones can contribute, sometimes a cause for pancreatitis is never found.\r\nPancreatic pseudocyst: After a bout of pancreatitis, a fluid-filled cavity called a pseudocyst can form. Pseudocysts may resolve spontaneously, or they may need surgical drainage.\r\nIslet cell tumor: The hormone-producing cells of the pancreas multiply abnormally, creating a benign or cancerous tumor.  These tumors produce excess amounts of hormones and then release them into the blood. Gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas are examples of islet cell tumors.\r\n\r\nEnlarged pancreas: An enlarged pancreas may mean nothing. You may simply have a pancreas that is larger than normal. Or, it can be because of an anatomic abnormality. But other causes of an enlarged pancreas may exist and require treatment.\r\n    \r\n          Pancreas Tests\r\n\r\nPhysical examination: By pressing on the center of the belly, a doctor might check for a mass in the pancreas. He or she can also look for other signs of pancreas conditions.\r\nComputed tomography scan: A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the pancreas and abdomen. Contrast dye may be injected into your veins to improve the images.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic waves create highly detailed images of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an MRI that focuses on the pancreas, liver, and bile system.\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Using a camera on a flexible tube advanced from the mouth to the intestine, a doctor can access the area of the pancreas head. Tiny surgical tools can be used to diagnose and treat some pancreas conditions.\r\nPancreas biopsy: Either using a needle through the skin or a surgical procedure, a small piece of pancreas tissue is removed to look for cancer or other conditions.\r\nUltrasound: A probe is placed on the belly, and harmless sound waves create images by reflecting off the pancreas and other organs.\r\nAmylase and lipase: Blood tests showing elevated levels of these pancreatic enzymes can suggest pancreatitis.\r\nSweat chloride test: A painless electric current stimulates the skin to sweat, and the chloride in perspiration is measured. People with cystic fibrosis often have high sweat chloride levels.\r\nGenetic testing: Many different mutations of a single gene can cause cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing can help identify if an adult is an unaffected carrier or if a child will develop cystic fibrosis.\r\n   \r\n       Pancreas Treatments;\r\nInsulin  Injection\r\nPseudocyst drainage\r\nPseudocyst surgery\r\npancreatic cancer\r\nPancreatic enzymes\r\nPancreas transplantation",

Nothing too big...card games and what not...some people feel as tho it is just either a little too depressing or a little too quiet within the app sometimes...",

            "Very useful app to help me get better in the Cardiopulmonary field. Cardiopulm was not a strong point for me in school and I feel like the information I am given here makes me more confident in my abilities to treat this population. You can choose a specific diagnosis (ex. CHF, CABG, etc.) and learn just about everything you need to know. The app provides information about clinical findings, what to ask in the subjective exam, how to perform objective tests (ex. bronchophony, tactile fremitus, etc.), and chart reviewing.  This app also provides interventions specific to each diagnosis. Overall this is an awesome app!",

            "It is a very good app mostly for beginners even the 30 days will be more than enough before you start seeing some bulging arms.i like it",
            "Exercises are too easy but too hard at the same time. Like they hurt my joints and get me out of breath but my muscles feel fine. I'm not in this for the cardio.",
            "Man !!! This workout app for arms is AWESOME !!! I already completed the ARM BEGINNER section and need to move on to the ARM INTERMEDIATE.

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

It kinda sucks and should be fixed to where every 10 to 20 turns should be an add unless u need jems or coins but otherwise stop the adds. I will wait 2 days then delete this app as well as all 3 of my kids and my wife as well.. So thats 5 people out if the adds dont stop.",
            "This is a nice game. I say this because i love playing it and it is lots of fun. I love all the skins you can get and all the hats. One more thing i like about it is the fact that is says what your high score is plus it is not easy but not hard. It a game justbright for me.",
            "fun game to play - from the start it was just a giant laugh to see when he lands - but i think you need to add more obstacles and add point to them as well at about the 26 thousand meter mark its nothing more than desert on - no other city's or airports and stuff now the sad part is the most recent update i got - you make a run just fine play the ad for reward make the upgrades to the ramp and jet pack and offline rewards the game will now go to the ramp and just float right through and continue going as it sinks down have to quit game and restart in order to advance to the next jump - every time i make the upgrades i have to quit and reload to make next just wow lots of fun there NOT!!! at 91 thousand meters and at this rate looks like 100 thousand meters will take several days to reach - been a bit of time and still nothing has changed - you make a good run then do the upgrades go for next launch fut to pass right through the ramp and by 60 meters or so you sink into the ground /// September 23Rd 2020 needed to load a update for the game and did so to still have the same problem make a jump and all is good play ad for reward and then go for next jump and bang still goes right through the ramp and starts to sink about 60 or 70 meters out and just keeps going - have to end game and reload just to make next jump what fun is that ?",
            "30 second ads, 20 second gameplay, rinse, repeat. Greedy ad revenue grab by developer. Hey developers, are you listening? It's actually faster to play the game, start an ad, force quit the game and restart the game. That's faster than watching an ad every single time.",
            "This game would be awesome, however greedy peolpe rule! What a sham! Ridiculous 2 part ads, lost almost all my winnings after shutting game down for the first time. Try and give 1 star from the app and it won't send you to the playstore. Put 5 stars and it sends it through. You people make me sick! Digital Corona mf's!"

            "I initially signed up for the app to stay motivated with losing weight and regaining my health. I love that it gives you informative health articles and you can participate in survey's. Once you earn 10,000 points you can redeem it for a cash reward or gift card (incentive) and if you're feeling generous donate it to charity.",
            "First. The step calculator is off by 1000 points if connecting to a Fitbit. For example: I hit 10,000 steps on my fitbit, Achievement only calculates 9000. Two: Achievement is constantly disconnecting from my fitbit and I have to resync everything, at least twice a week, and the sync can take up to 10 minutes. 3. Only logs half my information from my fitbit. I workout everyday and I wear my fitbit everyday, the Achievement log says the last time I was active using my fitbit was 2 weeks ago. 😣😡",
            "This app has been amazing! I love being rewarded for making healthy lifestyle choices! This app encourages me to move more, so I can reach the goal of 10,000 points sooner. I also appreciate all of the research that has been done. I am a member of the healthcare community and have found that all of the information they publish is accurate and reliable! I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family!",
            "I forgot I had the app installed, not sure how long I've had it. I have just been trying to get in shape, exercising, keeping up with my calories and such, and today I saw the app and remember it gives points and I had earned 26k points so I was able to cash out $20 to paypal. Seems great as a passive way to earn money.",
            "Takes forever to get rewards. I have had it synced with my Fitbit and it was with Myfitnesspal. I think I've been using a year and a half and still haven't received the first $10, only at 8400 points of the 10000 required. Not very motivational in my opinion."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

There are 3 levels to choose from: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Working my way through beginner then on to the next level and so on. We'll see what the results are in 90 days.",
            "Really nice app, working with you while you exercise. Wish there is an option to increase and decrease rest and workouts on the fly instead of just skip on increase.",
            "This is what I exectly need. This app is so great I work for thinnest for one hour a day but when I got this app I take exercise for 11:00 mins but the value was the same as an hour. I love this app 👍👍👍",
            "It matches the rate and rhythm of the exercises provided and improvements have been noticed already. Also \" rest days\" match the days I need very well.",

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

Having tech issues with the app. I will get a notification for an article. I will open it. It will open in a browser that will only show me a few paragraphs and have a button for open in app. I push the button, instead of taking me to the,app and,article it takes me to Google play. I open the app with Google play but it takes me to front page, not article.",
            "Overall good content and insightful writers, gives great perspective into the world of your favorite sports teams and leagues. The app itself could be more user friendly and could use a few more features to help track discussions in comments section. Downside is recently the Athletic has be come very politically driven, comments and content are HIGHLY censored and filtered based on opinions of the staff which is leads to an echo chamber effect so to speak. All in all it's a good app.",
            "Content is excellent, and would definitely recommend subscribing. The app itself is also very good, but I face some issues when Pausing/Resuming/Stopping/Starting when old articles pop up when following a link or notification. Other than that, it is easy to use and great to look at.",
            "I sign in, app still tells me to sign in. Then I subscribe using PayPal and it charges me £1 only to redirect me to a page telling me I have no subscription, so I use my card to subscribe and this time it works. But I've been charged twice. Constantly tells me to sign in when I've already done it. Very frustrating.",
            "If you are a sports fan, you really should be subscribing to this site / app. Excellent, indepth content, and no ads. The app allows you to refine your news feed so you see the stories and authors that interest you the most. Edit: Since summer, if an article has embedded video, app makes the article text unreadable."

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "I need my controls back. This is just getting so annoying. Ever since I made a review I've lost so much control. So f in inconsistent. Just give me control of my bike Presss the gas and no movement. Lean forward and bike keeps going backwards. So sick of spending more time fight useless controls then being competitive. Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",
            "To get bike 6 it takes for eaver if you dont play other people much it's been 3 or 3 days and I'm only at 500 it is taking too long to get another bike please fix this it is annoying",
            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

Thank you for the app.",

Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

            "Been my favorite \"go-to\" photo editing app. Wish there was the same features for videos. But I dont take many of those. So I don't mind keeping it strictly to photo edits. My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "It's a fun game most of the time. Addictive, too. But sometimes the game seems determined to take all your coins back, and I don't know if that's on purpose to make you buy more, or what? Edited: After gaining more experience in the games, and winning quite a bit, I do appreciate the \"lifelike\" experience, but still find certain things a little frustrating, such as a challenge to get 40 Sloto Card Stars to complete my Daily Dash, and taking until 11:59 pm to be awarded enough Cards to finish.",
            "GLITCHY THEIVES! The game was fun until it started to glitch! Then the reels would spin and not stop. I updated it hoping it would be better but it just made it WORSE! I tried to turn in my stars for a spin on the Super Wheel, not only did the wheel not stop spinning but once the error message appeared my cards and stars were GONE! I didn't get any prizes for them or compensation! Like I said, GLITCHY THEIVES!!",
            "It's good that there is no ads to worry about. The game flow is fine. But if I decide to put money into this game I find no real gain from it. Game goes into immediate lockdown. It will run me right out of the coins I paid real money for. This isn't a real casino. I dont stand to win real money. If I pay for chips I expect to get a boost out of the game instead of being shutout. Not a good business model. You can change your algorithms on your game. Make it worth players time. We pay. You don't.",
            "As John Goodman says you never know what today will spin! It is an exciting game, the graphics are great and you are not constantly interrupted by ads! I count some of the people in my clan as friends, we play as a group on challenges and it is competitive fun! New games and challenges keep it fresh! Once you play Slotomania, you will not want to play other slots games. It's that good! The seasonal games and prizes are terrific! Grafics are terrific!!!",
            "I'm through buying anything in this app. Real life happens to everyone. In the last three days of NOT buying, I've received a star spin in half hours and hour spins ONCE !!! can tell you when I was buying, it was almost Everytime spin stars. They let me know how they are I'm a level 2679 !!!! I'll still play with my clan, but No More Buying !!!!!"

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

Season pass is very stingy. 6 months of playing and you still will be average in stats. Game is very fun. But I spent $16 and have played for months and I have a long way to go. Game is fun but the creators are the greediest Ive evr seen. Could be one of the best ever, but your kids will learn what being Robbed feels like! Enjoy",
            "The game is entertaining sure.. but the controls are absolutely horrible! Half the time, it doesn't respond well, especially during the goalkeeing.. therefore losing the match.. fix this issue. Edit: Forget about what I said about it being entertaining! It's not!! How can it be when the whole game is rigged at higher levels..",
            "THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! Do NOT get this game unless you want to be scammed out of coins you bought from your own money. I am barely on level 3 and im constantly going against players who are like level 20. Also whenever try to block a kick it keeps somehow going through my hands like im some kind of ghost. And, whenever i do the 400 coin game it charges me 500 COINS instead of 200! I do not reccomend this game.",
            "Addictive game but annoying as hell when you're put up against someone who's player has so much power in their shot it makes it nearly impossible to save. And when you play against someone on shooting race, sometimes your opponent resets for the next kick so much faster than you do (somehow) you cant win because they're 2 shots ahead of you!",
            "Paid $4.99 for VIP to 3rd Season Anniversary Cup yesterday. Game suddenly restarted in the final match. After restart, lost all VIP benefits. Later a Gold Cup was added to my account... Were is my VIP winner's green striped jersey and other winner's prizes? If you charge real money, test your product! The same issue happened before. That's why I didn't purchase anything extra for the game for a long time. Seems like nothing has changed on your side. That's sad."

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "Thank you for correcting the issue with ads being displayed after paying for premium. Question: is it possible to include in the options menu the ability to move the controller position to the player's liking? The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",

            "This game is a random game, I like it for the fact that it makes you think but as an offset it drops stuff you can not think about. If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

There is a lot of ads so I reccomend turning on airplane mode. Definitely a no. 3 on my top 10 apps. Would recommend!",
            "I'm not gonna lie but to be honest, this game is just like those typical instant making games with little to no serious effort unlike those like idle heroes which put it lots of effort. Also, this game spams lots of ads, and the ones for itself is just total rubbish, doing the I'm a GODDAMN FREAKING NOOB kinda things and accidental touches automatically triggers the link to the install window. Nope, definitely not touching this one since it's just one of the so many trashy ones popping recently.",

I have not heard the sound design yet (been playing with volume off) but I hope its the same as before. That is my real only complaint. If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "Dev's team there is a bug: the interface and all the gameplay is so fast that it just not playable anymore. Bugs: 1.Interface is more responsive, simple touch opens up 2-3 options. 2. Not able to play any track, the overall gameplay speed of bike is increased to 10times as of normal gameplay speed. 3. Unable to connect to server error when opening showdown section. Looking forward for the fix soon.",
            "Game's really fun , like the physics of the game , how every bike felt unique in terms how it feels , but i do have a complaint about a bug I am encountering at the moment where my game sort of crashes every time i opened up the map...i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game and logged back in to my account but it still keeps happening...would like to have you try and fix this issue for me , it would be really helpful. Otherwise good game , keep up the good work devs",
            "Played Trials since the 1st one, big fan! :) This one, like all the other Trials games, gets quite hard after a while..But still fun & addicting. Been playing this version for about a year. Theres always more to do/unlock. One downside, there hasnt been any of the different big holiday events for the last several holidays. I was hoping thered be a halloween event this month like last halloween. So sadly the games hayday might be over? Hope devs dont quit this one yet, still has a ton of players.",
            "Love this game but i come out of the bike shop and it says downloading latest content and that's it. Doesnt download. I'm connected to the internet and everything is fine in my end. The game just wont download. It really angers me because I love playing this game. I had it about a year ago and it was great. I re downloaded it and could only do 5 missions and then it says its downloading latest content but doesnt, and I cant play while it's doing that. I can't play the game at all now.",
            "Amazing graphics and ATD. I love everything about the game. And you never get too good of bikes to just breeze through the game. My only problem is that terracotta is made to make you better. As well as make you use timesavers. When you race him at the mill, he uses the only timesaver there. Making it extremely hard."

And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",
            "Like flying for the first time. Like a pool on a hot summer day in Modesto. Like a cup of hot chocolate on Christmas. Like checking ALL the boxes on your daily to do list. Like having all the laundry folded after watching an episode of the magicians, except that towel you used to wipe your tears with. Like strawberry bingsu in loser angeles in August. Like hugging your mom. Like reaching Challenger in Starcraft. Like making before after pictures of when you finally clean. Like comment subscribe.",
            "Very nice app ...I accidentally uninstall this up and I almost cry ..good thing after searching for days I found it..this is very useful in making invitations..I just wish you add more text options, calligraphy,and color like gliter effect on text .good thing this is update new effects were add..kudos to the developer..keep up the good work."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

        "comments": [
            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "Two is what you get!! I'm pissed right now with the bugs on the dunk game. It's been several times when Im in the middle of a dunk and matter fact, nah I'm giving yall one star. Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "Used Groupon at launch, when it was actually a bargain site. Nowadays I hardly use it. If you search for goods on eBay/Amazon, 9/10 times they'll be £3-4 cheaper. I only use the app. Was offered 20% off next order, no code, link, or details. Pressed accept and it said it would be applied at checkout, it wasn't. Spoke to four agents on chat, all copy/paste template replies. When I started complaining, all four pretended they couldn't see my replies and that I'd gone idle and disconnected me.",
            "I absolutely LOVE GROUPON! It is the only app I use for my great deals! I get on there atleast 3 times a day sometimes more! The notifications are awesome! && I love how is a variety of things. The up to 97% off some things blows my mind! Such great deals. If you don't have this app its an amazing app and a great way to save money",
            "There should not be this many daily notifications for the little amount of content on this app. The search is garbage. It routinely shows \"deals\" in my area, amd o then find out my area is apparently two states away. Very few business use this anymore. While these are strange times, this was still the case last year. No worthwhile deals. All the goods sold herr are also pretty garbage deals. They can regularly be had on amazon on elsewhere for the same price as their sale price on groupon.",
            "Total waste of time. First, there were not many deals in my area. Then when we traveled with it, there was not much savings. Then it started charging my card when I did not authorize the charge for a \"groupon select\" there is no customer service to call, only email and online chats. I contacted them for the last year telling them to unsubscribe me, each time I was told it went thru. Is an act of God to get them to answer email or the online chats. They are like a bad case of the herpes.",
            "Some good deals, but not all what they seem and customer service is a joke. I paid $21 for 3 days of airport parking and was charged another $40 when I left. According to the Groupon, regular price would've been $30, so I paid twice as much as I would have without the \"deal\". I tried to chat with customer service twice and got no help, then disconnected in less than 1 min while I was typing a short reply, clearly because they didn't want to be bothered, and this is just one example of MANY."

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

I have 5G and full service and a good processor in my phone, and it runs slow when trying to connect when starting up. So it's not my phone, because fortnite runs just fine and I assumed it would give me a lot of problems. But the initial start up is what's troublesome, other than that, great game.",
            "This game is fabulous however there are some problems associated with it which are needed to be fixed in order to make it better. Firstly, its greatest problem is that we enter in those MP matches which have already started, this squeezes all the fun out while playing a match, it was fine earlier but now it happens too frequently. This problem is a major setback here. And secondly, in BR matches its frame rate is a major problem, it is not as smooth as MP matches. So kindly fix this. !PEACE!",
            "The amount of content that you guys are trying push, sell, advertise is what will ultimately drive users away. Keep the design simple man. There's more menu's on this game than a PC game. Stop it. Also unbelievably huge game. It's not enough to download the game. You have to download maps, camps , weapons, modes. Just stop. I gave the game 5 stars earlier. Now it's filled with junk",
            "New updates still can't play the game. Nothing but buzz sounds and then kicks you from the game. Awful experience. Even if you wanted to play every day you can't. Don't waste your money. First experience with app was amazing. Now there is so much lag the game isn't even fun anymore. Okay haven't been able to play game because the game won't load. Just a weird noise and game shots off. Nothing but garbage!",
            "I've never experienced a mobile game so welll made as this. Truly exceptional. I think one of the greatest features of this game is that you don't need to spend money to keep up with multiplayer game play. The game rewards you for playing for free!! Which is unheard of at the level of quality this game provides IMO. I have cricket wireless, and I play about an hour and a half a day for the past week or so and I've had NO ISSUES. not only that but the game doesn't even go through that much data!"

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Folia Health is a great and easy was to track your medical needs. I honestly took a break from using Folia Health due to them not having an Andriod dedicated app. However, now that the Andirod app is here I love it. I enjoy being able to easily check off what medications and treatments I did that day, from the comfort of my bed at night. I also love how active and friendly the Folia Health team is!! Using Folia Health has made my health tracking easy and has provided me peace of mind!",
            "Lacks a lot of features. If youre tracking any kind of health issues, you usually would want to track the time, symptom, intensity & location. This feels like a glorified notebook where you can only type in keywords for your symptoms too. So no full sentences. I have used health tracking apps that have way better features. There is no space for vital signs either. Just lacking a lot. Was so looking forward to the app but it didnt deliver."

It's annoying since I have to go on the app very 15mins to check if i have any messages, and it also sometimes doesn't even send despite having a good connection. Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

Included in this tool are important links to learn more about quitting smoking, lung cancer screening, and to identify lung cancer screening programs that are accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR).\r\n\r\nFOR PROVIDERS:\r\n\r\nThe rate of lung cancer screening among eligible patients in only 1.9% nationally. The Tamegagi scoring criteria used in this application is an accepted method of identifying patients for lung cancer screening and has been shown to be superior in sensitivity while maintaining specificity as compared with the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrollment criteria. Use this tool with patients to identify if your patient is eligible for lung cancer screening and to show them the impact smoking is having on their risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nWhat is lung cancer and why is lung cancer screening important?\r\n\r\nLung cancer is a cancer that develops in the parenchyma or airways of the lungs and is most commonly related to smoking, which is the biggest risk factor for this disease. Lung cancer is difficult to identify early due to a lack of specific symptoms, and therefore typically presents at an advanced stage where cure is more difficult and sometimes not possible. Recently, two major studies have been able to show an improvement in survival for patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer and are screened with an annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in 2015 the US Preventative Task Force (USPTF) endorsed a recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This rating was given a “B” grade which indicates with high certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening, which is the same grade given to mammography for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral groups, including Tammemagi et al and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have suggested that today’s screening guidelines may be missing patients who are at risk due to other factors than smoking history and age, such as comorbidities like COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, family history of lung cancer, or certain higher risk minorities. In fact, Tammemagi scoring was found to have improved sensitivity of 83% over the 71% of USPSTF while maintaining specificity of approximately 63%. Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.\r\n\r\nThis application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic\r\nMarkRWaddle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGraphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

            "Needs events or something to make power ups easier to get Some levels are damn near impossible without them and the gold is expensive af. ** love the game overall! Have been playing for a long time! I've made it past over 300 levels but this entire time it's kind of been a lackluster game compared to some of 'your' others",
            "Its always challenging to figure out how to defeat a level. The only levels I really dont enjoy are the ones where there are chains over the buckets and you have to hit a matching color \"face\" thing to open it and the \"face\" changes color and changes which bucket it opens.That one is too confusing trying to figure out the pattern without wasting pears to shoot.",
            "Simple and fun,but there are some REALLY hard levels that can take even days to beat,such a simple and long game shouldn't have such hard levels. There should be an option to skip levels for free if,for example,you fail to beat it in 10 - 15 lives or maybe even less.",
            "I click the little circle on the top right corner and it says to put my fb information and when I do , says invalid token access .. what does that mean? why can't I see which level my friends are on ? Please fix",
            "It's an entertaining and addictive game, but it has some major cons. You only get 5 lives and you have to wait a certain amount of time before they regenerate, even though this game is clearly designed to make you constantly fail and replay levels. 5 lives is not enough, a game like this shouldn't even be using the \"lives\" format, it just ruins the experience and makes me stop playing since I have no more lives. This game is all about luck, not skill, which is extremely annoying and lazy."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

I try to think that's it's just a mistake we can't do anything about it but the glitch level is really too much. I can't handle it anymore! Pls fix it! Hero dash is much better, try to make this game like tom hero dash. And are you serious? 6 hours of waiting just for unlocking a silly vault in a game? The torture is too much. Very mad 😫😵😢👿",
            "This game is really fun and it helps me get past time. Theres just on problem. This is neither happening to me or a few people. When I try to cross over to a different neighborhood through the tunnels I some time go under the road and it lags or theres some kind of invisible wall. Anyways its probobly just my internet. It's a great app. I would say the same thing for talking tom hero dash but leave out the tunnel part. That game is fun too. And a bit better.",
            "This is an amazing app! I love how its wifi free too! Idon't have any problems with it, though, sometimes the app IS a bit glitchy, but that has only happened a few times. At the moment, i am on the second tom up! I DO have a few things you could add to this game such as double jump and add more themes like underwater. I like the under ground bits where you turn up in a whole new world like the skateboard one, in the air, the sewers and ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER!",
            "This game is so cute😊 and cool at the same time. You can get characters like Tom,Angela,Ginger,Hank&Ben that's so cool and when you are running you can even go to different worlds like the underwater world,the dessert etc. The game play run smooth when you dob't have on you're wifi or you're service. This game don't let you stay on one running bath tou can go to different parts.",
            "Very adorable and fun game! Great way to pass time! All the characters are very cute and I smile everytime I play. I love the skateboarding part!Quite a cheaper version of Subway Surfers but much much cuter. But I don't really like the controls. Please make them more sensitive, or improve them overall."

            "First of all, there are just so many damn ads. You have to see a whole lot of em. Like you get an ad after every match. Secondly, there is certain network issues with some specific opponents only. I mean like it's all going good then suddenly an opponent and it gets network and they just win it, especially if you are playing a tournament. That's really frustrating.",
            "Yet another great game ruined by greed! To the Dev...you know those adverts that keep popping up? Nobody watches them, nobody clicks on them, nobody cares about them because they are irrelevant and so out of touch. Also, why are we limited to playing only 5-6 games before we have to pay money to refill? Absolute D**k move. So why don't you just make a €2.99 one off payment option and let us enjoy your god damn game!!! I'll even put money on the fact that you won't even respond to my review 🤫",
            "This game is such a pay-to-win! It comes up to three things: pay for diamonds, buy powerups, and win matches swiftly. You can be 5 scores ahead of another player and suddenly lose the match because your opponent uses their powrups to win the game in 20 seconds! You can even pay for bigger and faster characters! The game itself was so good if both players had equal abilities in every match.",
            "Greed has ruined the game, thanks developer. This game is actually fun and exciting but there are ads after every match. It's very annoying. If you love to watch ads every 1.5 minutes of game play, you need to have this game! There are countless of \"crazy special deals\" that you can purchase at \"up to 90% off\". Just so many ways that entice players to spend spend spend!",
            "The game is getting ridicules! I believe when one click search, the game should automatically put an opponent of the same level of power! Not a ridiculously super powered opponent who you don't stand a chance against! I'm not enjoying this game any more. This issue should be fixed. Here I am writing you new update. I thought you guys have take into consideration your the reviews of your users and fixed the issue which everyone is complaining about! You guys suck. big time."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

I think I should rate it 0 but no option for that so I rated it 1*.👎👎👎👎👎THIS IS VERY BORING...",

Multiplayer is kind of fun but lots of ads are popping when im playing so what if you use Hotspot and wifi to join with nearby players than using mobile data and what if you add competition game with oyher moy in hotspot. And last what if you add a button which can turn moy between mortal and immortal which he can die and not in that way kids will be more responsible😄😄😄",

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I've had so much fun playing this game. it's awesome! I love those soundtracks They put a different soundtrack for practice mode so it's like you have to complete the level in normal mode to enjoy the music. The levels are hard, i must say, but the music is what makes you want to complete it. However i would recommend shapes and beats much more. its much easier than geometry dash. But this game is also cool. Try it. You'll have fun!",
            "This game is Awosmeeee! the music and everything is so cool this is perfect for offline games and geomitry. One thing i like that it is 1:offline 2: geomitry 3: all of those other 1 2 and also i love this game!!!! the last thing i like about this game is that its filled with entertainment and its offline and geomitry and fun all mixed together.",
            "absolutly addicting. There is no flaw with this game. I see it a lot that people complain of the ads, but there is a simple way of fixing that, and that is turning off your wifi. I recommend this game so much, not only is it fun, but you get good jams added on to it!",
            "This is an amazing game! Love the music and everything. Played all the other Geometry Dashes and I would highly suggest you get this and all the others. And to Meiya Carter... this game is supposed to take lots of tries and be difficult... they are inactive because there are many other Geometry Dash games that they are focusing on. If you get all panicky that's because you haven't gone through that part yet. I suggest you keep trying at it... takes many tries but is fun once you learn the game!",
            "For me I think this is a great game... but if you dont have a lot of patience then this is not for you. There are some ads but they only come up once or twice, for me I love it. Its the best like when my friend comes over she ALWAYS wants to play this game. Its very addictive and also after high school I always wanna play this game. I love it. Rhank you for making this"

            "Jetpack Jump, as the name suggests the game is packed with fun levels, the upgrade option as you pass a level gives you more power to jump as far as you can. The advertisements between the game helps you triple the rewards which can be used to upgrade the suits. You can also skip the advertisement by simply clicking the collect button which will not triple the rewards. You enjoy the game as you pass the levels."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I thought I was gonna give it another chance but it's way to pay to win. If you guys could lean more towards the free-to-play players and set it a pay-to-win players then this game will be way bigger. You guys add a new character like every month how are free to play players supposed to get those characters? Every time a new character comes out I have 100 Shino bites but it's like 500 to summon that doesn't make sense. Y'all won't see this cuz I drowning in money. Free-to-play games are best!!!",
            "I love this game. It gives you all characters at the beginning and gives you easy chances of earning their cards and developing your village expeditiously and the graphics are amazing. Anything with Naruto I live for and I'm glad I have happen to be introduced to this game. But my problem is that the game consistently logs me out making me have to use the game's currency (Shinobite) just to restore my energy. Other than that I enjoy it and look forward to more ideas unfolding in the game!",
            "Please fix the S.A.M. Event. This is the 2nd time I'm unable to play properly as the game crashes when the mission starts. I already contacted the support team for this before and tried their advise on clearing the cache from the game itself, but the issue persists. And from the looks of it, I'm not the only one having the issue. I actually enjoy this game but the crashing issue with S.A.M. is irritating. Please fix it!",
            "Despite the constant kick out from attack missions, the game is overall good, just gotta work on the app to where it wont kick players out of the attack missions. I am aware that there are others battling the same issue, so im adressing me as well as the others that battle the same issue. The sam missions will not work for me and the team missions for the Naruto ( kumara link mode) aren't working either, please fix these issues for other players and me.",
            "So unfortunate, such great potential, such poor delivery! Now more P2W than ever! Well laid out and easy to navigate with plenty to do and lots of useless characters. New characters are going to be p2w walled requiring upto 8000 Shinobites, which are priced sooo absolutely insanely high for what you get. Psuedo \"daily\" missions never seem to reset, so they should just call them \"monthly\" missions. Ai pathfinding is terrible. A fun game that could be great if they care to actually fix problems..."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

Next one, back flips. I did several back flips & only one was counted. Did it again & still, only one had been counted. Repeated the process again & same result. Hope I have helped in some way to resolve the problem. Thank you & have a great day",
            "I started playing this years ago only because my friends were playing it in high school and I remembered it being really fun. Especially just trying to beat each others highscores and trying different cars to comeplete stages. Its so nice to see that the game still has so many downloads and still has its charm as it did back then. Addictive gameplay, smooth, simple but yet beautiful graphics (looks and feels good on a bigger screen device), fun progression and also completely free to play.",
            "This is a really nice game. But the idea of havingbto start from the beginning every time is really bad. There should be lives or check points. If you die,you start where you died. You can do this maybe only twice,then from there you have to start from the beginning again. Starting over n over makes me not wanna play anymore",
            "Great app with a great features there are. So much entertainment in it it is the one of the great feature of this game. This game is good no ads in it is also a good feature in the game new cars are good and improved . That is why I love the game there are new and entertaining paths and ways I like the game very much thee are no glitches in the game ( app. ) . This is also quite funny when the man sitting in the car dies this is a great app. I have a great experience.",
            "Overall i love this game. The graphics, and ease of play is relsly good. Ive been playing it for ages and i did get really far at one point until i lost all my data before saving it. Onky problem i have with this game is the amount of time it takes to save up the coins to upgrade and unlock things."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "Ok, unlike Geometry Dash Lite this game is not laggy at all, plus there is so much more to do in this game! I'm in love with it! This game is super addicting and fun! I would highly recommend this to people who like doing things to the beat and like hard challenges! ( Disclaimer, you can't make your own levels, but I'm fine with that )",
            "This game is awesome. There are a ton of creative levels and the music really gets you pumped when you start completing large chunks of a level. My only problem is that it really isn't receiving updates and there isn't as much stuff as there is in the OG Geometry Dash. Honestly I just want the game to receive a bit more attention and I'll be fine",
            "This game is so awsome i can only text short but this is 100% cool right but actually there is a secret in GDW plus there was alot of secrets in this game but actually i cant get the medal called \"Cold As Ice\" right guys and use some headphones so you can hear some cool song like 100% cool remix but i want to tell guys, im not a pro im a 5%pro and i can only finish easy,na and medium mode but i cant beat hard mode and modes right and thats it okay!!!!! I love Geometry Dash okay!!!!!",
            "This game is so fun! There are tons of obstacles on the way and the songs are so good! It gets harder on the way all though I had this game before it's as exciting as the first time I played it. I am Aiyah and this is opinion of this game.",
            "This is a really cool gd game, and it gives you more features than Lite. It allows access to some featured levels, your previously downloaded levels via save bug, etc. I really want to have a new island, however. The amount of stuff is still very limited because the levels don't update. Keep making updates and new games, because you are doing pretty good 👍"

            "Not even worth half a star. For one, the game is a poor excuse for a bootleg Clash Royale rip-off. Second the game developers failed at the match making system because you end up going against players as much as 3 levels higher with very strong cards. There is no strategy other than paying for the cards with your money. Pay to win game. See how little the developers care about the fanbase, because there are no responses. Why? Because it is an obvious sign that they are just in it for money. Sad.",
            "The game is great, UI is awesome. It lags sometime but that can be due to your internet connection as well. What i hated about this game doesn't have a \"level playing field\". The randomness of opening any card from the chest during play is not the right way to go about this game! It provides a luck factor which is not ideal for a strategy based game like CC. What can we do instead: start the chest with the least maina cards first and after all the 12 cards are opened, then do a random shuffle!!",
            "Love this game. Been playing for a long time but it could use at least one update other than the rebalancing of characters abilities. I am at level 11 but can be beaten by a level 6? Ridiculous. Plus, honestly, I prefer the daily games more, but that does not ever increase my castle level. Ridiculous! Overall I am addicted, but I would rather not keep giving my money away for no real benefit.",
            "The game is good. Graphics are good, characters are good. The problem is that it happens many times that match do not get start even though I have a stable Internet connection. And in a clan when we try to battle, it do not enter me in match and i lost the match. It is quite annoying. Fix it and i will give you 5 stars.",
            "Now I played for about a Month, the tournament is around. STOP❗ .... Game not worth it. Can't compete if you don't have the Super High Powered Cards to win. Don't get me wrong the game is fun if on Regular Mode, great match making. BUT The game chooses cards randomly. Your opponent can get there best cards first. While you get your Higher Seed Cards. I Repeat, I Repeat, \"There is No Strategy to this game\" -- The Higher Payer wins❗"

            "I like the game it's it's fun you can play with it and a and also I can jump up and down and said the only thing is at the jump on my back instead of my stomach jumping I can't do backflips and I also at the light on my legs so it's pretty challenging for me but it's going to be fine So yeah so I like to know as much but it's what is popular and it's good so I gave a",
            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",
            "okok so first things first this game is literally the best and if u turn off wifi/turn on airplane mode there is so ads second things the game glitched out sometimes but it is super funny to see the characters and the trampolines dislocate themselves lastly i would totally reccomend this game and if u rate 1 star bcuz u dont like it ur a loser no offense",
            "Great game! 5-stars! I wish it was a little easier to get new flips, but other than that, fantastic! If you like gymnastics or flip games, definitely install.",
            "It is a fun game to play but it is a little hard to play you have to time your jumps right or you will land wrong there is also a lot of ads but other wise it is a good game"

            "A year ago I gave this 4 stars. However I now give it 1 star. You can no longer watch videos to earn credits, the only way to get credits is by paying! You can't get noticed unless you use credits to \"rise up\" or use credits to be \"seen more\"! Plus you need credits to message. In the swipe left/right part of the app, the vast majority of people shown are 20-90 miles away!? Presumably if you pay then you'll see local people? I am however currently giving it another try and I'm enjoying it more",
            "Disappointing. The App was very much focused on getting you to pay. The search doesn't work well as it is based on people paying to be moved up. Before you could at least watch ads to get extras. But that seems to be going and it is becoming even more a cash grab. I didn't mind the as option as I understand that the can't operate for nothing. But seems to have gone too far now. A shame",
            "This is a really well made app and probably my favorite dating app I've seen so far. Its full of friendly people, has a good system in place to prevent bots, and is LGBTQ friendly which is really cool. The problem is you have to pay to see who liked you which is really annoying and makes it hard to talk to anyone who doesnt have premuim or is obsessive and uses the 'crush' feature on you which also kind of has to be paid for. Overall it's a good app, I just wish it wasnt another pay to date app",
            "That is a tricky application , you pay for nothing after some message you will not able to send more. And they send you to another way to pay more. To adding... although i had pay for a week to try it ... i could only write some message and then \" you are able to write more with 200 credit\" this is the message that mean with about 30-40 €/month . Your respons is totaly confused. Ma credits isn't the money that i had payed once? And i must take them from somewhere to use here?",
            "The freebies are not workin. It's been over a month since I've been able to use it to get points. I've uninstalled the app more then 5 times and its still not workin. Can you please fix the freebies? Also lots of profiles are fake ppl. They don't verify their acct. They shouldn't be able to use app or contact anyone if they are not verified to be real. To many scammers. Please do something to fix that."

            "This game is really good for using time when you have nothing to do and is generally a very fun game. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, I was saving up 15 dollars (in game) to buy the coin rain and once I got the 15 needed it stopped me from buying it.",

            "I don't have all the badges in the game but it is pretty good not going to lie I got all the factories and I got to the millions of the Mondays and I got a couple robots I got like 18 and right now I got the trophy my first Trophy and recent at the game I'll see you later guys now time for me to work doing this"

            "Amasing.., just amazing. It is a great game with awesome music, and I have minor complaints that are just me, and don't really effect the gameplay. 1. Press start last coin is a pain 2.nock em, is way to hard to be a hard rating. 3. Power trip backwards wave is a little bit tricky, (I love it though.) 4. It is a lttle bit add-heavy. (But that is how you make money so...) and 5. Power trip 75% is annoying. Over all, this is just me being nitpicky, great game. Good job robtop! Eddit: (2.2 when?)",
            "This game is really Awesome! The Music, Effects, and more! My favorite level is Press Start, all people like press start because its has a really cool music. But the part that i hate in Press Start is the Last coin and that makes me hate the game :D Big thank you to the creators for creating this game! It cheers me up sometimes :)",
            "This game is epic. Most of the 1 star reviews are people complaining on how it's so hard, how their device isn't the problem: the game is, and how it's so messed. But in reality, they just need practise, their device is the problem and the reason it had lost of ads is because this is one of the free games in the franchise kept up by ads. I love this game and hate it when noobs say how terrible it is when all they nerd to do is practice. If at first you don't succeed, try try again.",
            "This game is soooooooooo fun and I'm not even joking. All of the levels are so hard but fun, all of the 1 star people are just noobs who aren't good at the game so they blame it on dumb reasons like oh when I press this it doesn't work, and stuff like that but in my opinion this game is really good and I'm enjoying it and I hope u do to",
            "This game is sooo cool!!I just love the way the intensity of the music builds. And the PRESS START.....the level starts calmly....and then...... BOOM! It becomes so intense!! Especially when the PRESS START suddenly pops up i get so excited! I love it. This used to be DanTDM's intro so its gotta be great. No wonder why Dan played this game so much. Every single geometry dash game is awesome. Thank you to the games' creaters who are so genius.Thank you so much!"

            "I love this game so much ❤❤but it really needs some upgrades like eggs and cakes and many more desserts and you should also give more utensils and dishes and a sink too like a REAL KITCHEN! !! That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",
            "It's so good I like it but the costumers is so ugly.",
            "Game keeps crashing after i play it for 1 minute",
            "It's a good game. Fun to play, interesting. Only problem is that more ingredients can be included, more cooking methods, and easier stuff. Especially issue is characters. I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "Great app, helped my father from another country to solve the problem with his old Android. Without this app it would be impossible. You only have to download this app to the phone to which you have to give access to enter and access this phone from the PC teamviewer.",
            "Don't use this app..Its a fraud app..He will ask about you card number and the registered mobile number which is updated in bank then they will deduct a big amount from your bank account ..Be careful with this app and don't download it ..Even its not a Google verified app..Don't use this app..Its a big scandal...",
            "Don't download and use, this app is used by scammers. I've received several of the Apple ICloud scam calls asking me to download this app to \"fix\" the issue. This is a scammer app, use at your own risk!!!",
            "I often use the free version of TeamViewer to help my brother with his PC issues, so thought I'd try it for mobile phones. We have the same phone, so I installed this on my phone, to test it out. The PC connected (telling me that I was limited to 5 mins), and worked very well, but then suddenly disconnected after a minute or so. When I try to reconnect, I keep getting an error \"Connection blocked after timeout\", and tells me there's a session limit, and to retry again in a minute. So I wait a minute.... and am told to wait another minute, then another minute. Some time later I tried again: I got a minute or two of access, then kicked out again My first impressions are that, unless I pay for the full version (we're talking £15 PER MONTH here!), this one isn't going to be any use to me, so I'm only going to give it one star - sorry!",
            "To the developer, you need to be more clear on the purpose of this app. People are often more stupid then average and down load apps because what they assume the purpose of the app. It works perfect for the intended use; i.e. helping move around apps and trouble shoot remotely. Not controlling games are all kinds of no sense Ive read in the comments. Smh"

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Products are very cute with reasonable prices BUT it doesn't resume from where I left, for example if I am in the middle of the page searching for something in the 'baby girl' category and due to some work I paused for a few minutes and my phone got locked up, and when I am ready to continue, it doesn't show from where I left, instead it starts all over again from the home page.",
            "Pretty decent app especially compared to similar ones out there. Expected delivery to take forever but was impressed it only took roughly a week (at least in the UK). Every single item is packed neatly and individually, quality so far was amazing, clothing so soft and the size right on point! Love all the discounts! There is room for improvement, such as the filters which don't always work (when choosing to see only a certain size, age etc), but overall I'm impressed and will keep on buying!",
            "The filters don't always work well which can be frustrating. The sizing of the clothes are not consistent. You also don't always get what is pictured. For e.g. I thought I was getting a set but it was only a top. I bought several items and satisfied with about half of what I received. Still on the fence about ordering again even with a voucher they sent me.",
            "I love shopping with PatPat! I'm Australian, so I was surprised how quick shipping is. The quality of clothing is great and the range of bright coloured clothing for boys is brilliant! It's so great to see an affordable clothing company doing bright clothing for boys rather than the boring blues, greys and browns you usually have to choose from at most shops. They have awesome sales too. I've been receiving lots of comments from strangers about my son's cool clothing.",
            "I like the clothes but the quality of some dresses is good and some not that good. And patpat made some levels if you reach that level you will receive some gift voucher every month but unfortunately they are not doing it, they have provided 1 month after that we need to chase them for the rewards. Instead of understanding customer querry they just want to debate with customers, I feel it's unprofessional and they need to improve customer service."

Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

            "I really enjoy this game. It has beautiful gaming experience, but please make this more smoother to control for us to aim and shoot those enemies to the head! I like the old animation when you're dead 'cause its funny and one more thing fix this problem: even my player and the enemies are hiding from the wall or other object we can still shoot them and die! Not realistic! Not Good! But I love this game, just, if you want to improve this in the next update not just fix bugs. Thank you.",
            "It's a very nice game. Please notice this. But I think to make the game more refreshing is to add more guns, because it kinda gets boring, when you play it all day with the same guns. I really hope you see this, and please please please add more guns. Please? This is a 5-star to show you how good your game is, and it could be better, thank you for making this game and please add more guns, once again ❤️🌹",
            "Liked this game more than my heart and soul, but, a bug is really annoying me. If I do not use or open it two or three times without turning on the cellular connection, it is a download is going to be prepared and download paused because wifi is paused. After turning on wifi and connecting to a network, download paused because wifi is unavailable. Please fix this bug in next update or else my data pack will be half finished and I have to continously reinstall it.",
            "I like the game especially when playing with my friends,but i would like you to add a Counter Strike Global Offensive, features (for example, different guns have different weights,you can throw your guns,pistols except for knives, and most important in the bomb mode, the bomb has a timer/you have to wait for the bomb to plant). Please reply",
            "Its like CSGO, but not really, the bots are stupid, even in \"bomb mode\" because they get greedy on the bomb, please, make the bots like in the CS games. and they always stop when they are going to change direction, and its kind of awkward. and the guns are TOO stable, even the awp is. in csgo, the awp is not really stable while you are moving, in the game, it just deals more damage, and the fire rate is trash. hope you devs read this."

Now being a smart PC guy, I call this app perfectly lightweight. :)",

However inputting 10 photos is enough but not enough background patterns, stylish texts and the lamest grids but I do like the border feature. I actually do like the photo grid feature with how many photos. I was using the app for free by the way.",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "Gave it a two star because everytime I do anything junkfiles, booster they all just start up again including overheating. After entering a site gotta go back and redue the process all over again. I don't know why this has been given so many stars ether it was useful after so many upgrades or someone likes given good ratings to crappy apps just too make other people mad.",
            "This app is really very amazing. Awesome, It cleans the whole phone in few seconds. I have never seen a phone cleaner like this. But there is very small problem and that is ads , we cannot do anything about ads. Nowadays every app contain ads. To remove ads we have to pay money 😭😭😭. Overall this app is the best phone cleaner. I have one small request to remove ads from this app👍.",
            "I like the app, but when using it advertisement pop up and if my phone rings app will not release the screen so I can answer the call. I watch most of the adds but I don't like anything that takes o Dr my phone. This may cause me to delete app again!! Just checked something today,the app has a cach cleaner. After I cleaned cach with your app, I went and checked cach on each and every app on my phone and had to clear them myself!",
            "Good app. But the ads are pretty annoying and if you want to remove them you need to pay real money for it . Wish there was an app with no ads no more annoying things . But aleast it's a pretty cool app , it can boost your phone in a second if you're phone lags so much . It will junk all the useless stuff in your phone which makes the phone cleaner. I recommend you guys to download the app",
            "This app is the best it made my phone to stop hanging and now I can use my phone without the worry of it crashing 😉 I really hope they prosper and more apps that are better than this. That's my reason for giving it five stars 😁."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "Can you fix the bugs like getting stuck in the ladder, teleport to the the sky,moves fast,goes through walls,cannot shoot,the fire button is gone,the fire button is going to be a parachute button and if I press the parachute button the fire button will going to be gone... But I really like the game... Can you make the map bigger? And make the red zone move slow",
            "Needs large improvement. The environment is good but the server can't handle more players. Sometimes it just picks me up from a match and drops me into another. Don't know why? Only the movement control works well, when the auto trigger is off you can't really play the game well. Additional voice conversation with other players will make the game more fun in Duo or Squad.",
            "Pleaze read, developer! I haven't played it but, it looks good and well made. But, some of the reviews said the graphics isn't really what it is in the pictures. So, I think developer, you should really fix that. And gameplay seems really good and fun, controls is fantastic, graphics uhhhh. Not sure about graphics so, imma edit this review later. You can get 4 Stars for effort! Oh, and! The reviews also said that the game lags like, LAG. So, fix that. Thank You for reading, developer.",
            "It's a good game I like it you want to fix offline play with bots It's a duplicate pubg.you want to fix voice conversation.it will be more fun i like very much this game. I didn't play Pugh or free fire. I saw the video of these games in youtube. I can't play these games. So I played this its my favourite battle Royale game thankyou",
            "Worst game I have ever played 1. It is extremely slow 2. Seriously the graphics is so bad 3. You cannot even match and enter immediately before you can play 1 game you need to match 5 times to play 4. The guns are totally useless seriously please fix these things else your game will be on the list of games that people do not even want to play and your effort will be wasted."

In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",

            "I've played this for about a year. It's very addictive. Only reason I will not give 5 stars is because of the adverts. Although this game does not thrust adverts at you after every level like some games do, you can optionally watch an advert to get a boost. Only problem is with some adverts they start forcing you to install another app/game, or sometimes the adverts freeze, or sometimes they cause the game to restart, they have even caused the phone to reboot. This is not good.",
            "Been playing this game for a couple of years now. I like how the daily rewards don't reset if you miss a day. I love that there is always something to do. Standard mines, event mines and the mainland. It would be nice if the prestige for the standard mines wasn't so expensive. I've only managed to prestige 2 mines in 2 years although I do spend most of my time on the event mines to be fair. Nice game to spend some time on. I like how you can upgrade your miners too.",
            "The game is fun enough, but I gave it 1 star for two main reasons. The game has recently started asking me to rate it at _least_ once a day. This is incredibly annoying, but here's your review. The other reason is that I was just offered the \"no-ads\" offer for $15, and coincidentally the game now freezes nearly every time I click on an ad for a boost. I keep having to exit the game, try to watch an ad again and hope maybe it works. I feel like maybe the two things are related. ETA: I did email.",
            "great little clicker, perfect for when you have a few minutes to spare, fast user interface and heaps of things to do, lots of freebies and a steady (if not a little slow) way to make premium credits however some of the in game purchases are fairly expensive, but honestly they're not necessary to progress in the game.",
            "The game is designed to kill time, it does that. Puzzles are my favorite, but when I'm on hold and still have to pay attention to my world this kills the time. Don't expect to be grabbed by how in depth or awesome this game isn't. Just click to fidget. Do I love it, no. Does it work as planned, yup."

            "Not a bad app, a little clunky to do some things but it works. There are 2 things that would improve the app for me. 1. Allow the app to work in landscape mode so the graph is easier to check. 2. Make it so you can zoom on the graphs, especially for heart rate. Even using a stylus it is very difficult to select individual readings let alone read the tiny text.",
            "Overall the watch is fairly decent. very difficult accessing & reading text messaging or mail message on watch. if you don't like to wear the watch tight on wrist, the pulse oxygen meter may be slightly off. Heart monitor blood pressure reads backwards. You can't customize the home screen, except for their 4 uploaded pictures, can't add your own. Wrist response is not very good. If you shake your wrist hard , it never wakes, no adjustable sensitivity meter. Sleep on app only. App runs always.",
            "Installed to go with a fitness tracking watch. The basic function of tracking steps works ok. More advanced functions like other activity tracking seem to work well with heart rate tracked over time. Blood pressure testing seems to be unreliable to the point where it's not usable. Weight tracking doesn't exist, you just enter your weight into the personal details but it doesn't track it over time. If you then change your weight, it keeps syncing your old weight to Google Fit making tracking your weight in google fit directly harder as it keeps getting events added with the wrong weight - there seems no way to turn this off. I'll probably keep trying with this for a bit longer but it would be helpful if I could choose which things were synced with Google Fit.",
            "Reading through the other complaints about watch/phone connection, I had that problem with a Fitbit versa and a Moto 5. I switched to a Arbily ID205 and this app and have had no problems. It doesn't have all the functionality of the Fitbit but it works reliably. It provides basic functions and clear easy user interface. Apps are limited to the functionality of a watch and its ability to connect with a phone.",
            "Never really had a problem with the app until recently. Within the last few days, the app has stopped showing me the heart rate zone details. I can see the graph, but the bars underneath don't register the exercise done. I checked back a few weeks, and it is the bars don't work there either."

Hey game devs keep the ads in because I know you all need money and that's kinda the point of games. And have you guys gotten any follow ups from the one start reviews?",
            "This game is so cool!! I love it, also it's free and the amount of space to download it is just right. This game isn't a waste of time. Sometimes I download games/apps and it doesn't work. But this game, I DON'T have that problem. So thanks a lot for making this game.",
            "Fun game. I'm only rating 4 stars because it starts to get a bit repetitive just jumping off the same cliff. Try adding obstacles and even compete against other players and this game will be great.",
            "Ok this is a very fun, good exciting game and love it. The only thing I don't like is what the ads are for what is the point of putting ads? That's my only downside to this game but I enjoy it",

Disappointed 😞 and angry. Thank God I cancelled the subscription but I would be very happy if I can get my refund back.",

Other than that it explains how long a phone has been active. Nothing else. From start time, activity length, and end time. No specifics, no what they were doing, no numbers chatted with. Just time on it seems like."

            "Used to look decent and work great, now it looks great and works decent. The new UI looks very clean and new, but it's difficult to recommend anymore because as of the new update, the Xbox remote function no longer works (almost) at all. If they fix it, then its basically 5 out of 5 stars and I'll update it. Until then, I don't have much use for it now except text friends on Xbox every now and then, and the occasional game clip",
            "The previous version of this app was wonderful. It had everything in easy to find places and was only missing the option to change your gamertag. In the current version, however, that is no longer true. The biggest two things that I can no longer find are where to access account settings, such as pfp and email, and I can't find my achievements anywhere. Nothing was even added to make up for this. They just removed some features and changed the app layout.",
            "With the latest update, the ui and simplicity of everything is nice; however, most of the main features that made the previous updates so great, were removed. The main purpose I downloaded this app, was to easily have access to my profile and check my achievements. Now that you can no longer do neither (other than being online/offline), it's useless to me. Disappointed.",
            "I do not like the latest update. It looks nice but the features I used previously are no longer available. Also, if I click on a friend's name from chat it gives me several options like delete, favorite, and unblock even if they aren't blocked. I clicked on unblock because I thought it was very weird that I had blocked my friend and thought I just have done it in accident. Clicking unblock actually blocked her. Luckily we figured that out pretty quickly. I wish I could uninstall the update.",
            "The removal of many features such as the store, redeeming codes, changing custom gamerpics and so on was an awful idea. I found the app difficult at times and slow but it worked for the most part, now it looks nice but key features for me personally are all gone. Hopefully they add these things back in the very near future as well as a bunch of other things. The new UI looks good for sure, but certainly wasn't worth losing so much for. Until then, 1 star is all it deserves in my opinion."

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

I want to tell you how this game is it's so awesome and I played \"very hard\" on difficulty but it seems esier than \"hard\", but whatever this the best soccer game I've ever played in the history of football game this game is so awesome. Hope more people install it. Keep your \"games up\" 😁",
            "Amazing game, beautiful, superb, mind blowing. Good gameplay, graphics are good. But why Christiano Ronaldo is in black skin. He he he. But real problem is that if the opponents kicks or make a foul then the referee does not whistle. But if we touch anyone then the referee gives foul as well as shows card, improve that. And please make the referee running with players or can be seen running in the ground. Which will make it more realistic. And make multiplayer matches. Extremely good game.",

            "(1) Why do i need to allow access to my Google Play Games Account again & again ? I don't want to enable auto-sign in because i don't want to get registered to Games i am trying out everytime. None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Now, the attack speed is kinda bad and we need a dodge. The game isn't that bad, well, i think it cpuld be a bit better. Like; we need more naruto villains, more types of show characters, and a better name for gohan. Yes, i know it's kinda hard finding good names for characters while also trying to avoid copyright, but still. I also feel like the game is a pay to win, so try to make it so you get characters while playing the game and beating them. Take xenoverse for example. So yeah, 3 stars.",
            "This game is super nice. But my points is the characters are way too expensive. Please reduce the price. I love you♥ you are the best.and one last thing. When I finish defeating my oppent and he falling I want to kick him down. Add that for me. And as in the picture two people were throwing their power and both of the power hit in the middle to see who power is strong. Will add that please. Anyone reading this you should download this game. Is the Best★♡♥★♥♡》》",
            "This game is Divine Perfection!Also, it would be nice if you put the ultra instinct weave effect.Keep up the good work!:) Nevermind I'm giving this game one star, I got locked out of my account, got it back, AND THE GOOGLE LOGIN DOESN'T EVEN WORK! SO NOW I CAN'T GET MY DATA BACK!I'm very sorry for the outlash, u deserve the five stars since it is not easy to make a game and I can just grind it back. Also thanks for replying because now I know that my problem is not a lost cause......👁️👄👁️",
            "Hi devs! I loved the game! But i have noticed something wrong, why does my foes was too easy to eliminate .-. I want an smarter one...i want a AI bot that can dodge our skills and can shields our skills. Thats will be more interesting. And why does all of the heroes had Goku's voice? You should make them their own voices. Pls add options/settings and settings or options for control layout and change controls. Why does naruto can fly? And why is his rasengan is looks like lava? Change it pls thx",
            "LOVELY game to play indeed; sound effects, environment,graphics could take a bit more improvements but the characters so far i'm really enjoying them playing this game already i really am. Its almost like i'm playing on the actual Xbox or PS4 console the only difference is this time the video game is in 2D and not 3D but as said the graphics and so forth adds up to every other features of the game. Keep it up developer i'm giving your content 4 stars for right now."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "Not the best game I've played I have 20+ car games on my phone and this is the 2nd worst. It is lagggy cars won't even drift properly. And it's just track drifting. I don't reccomend",
            "All in all just a good game good graphics drifting is quite easy",
            "Has some cool tracks and cars but I think they should add more cars like I would be happy as heck to see a 2004ish Toyota Camry replica priced 250000 coins or some unusual drift car like that It just needs more cars! There is no fake Bugatti no fake Lamborghini or a fake Ferrari or a maclean I think there is much room for improvement for this game but overall it's pretty fun i guess especially if you just want to pass some time.",
            "I really like this game but i have a problem 1.why cars always slide and crash to the wall everytime i wanna spin right it slide and crash to the wall 2.everytime i win the ad pop up but i like this game"

Three last the months however, I haven't been able to use the app for anything as it can't seem to verify my information. I am unable to receive payments, send payments, add money or cash out money that's in my cash app account. I've reached out to support numerous times with no response. I love there convenience of the app and the boosts I was getting but not anymore.",
            "I hate this app! It's useless. Can't do anything like you're suppose to be able to. Linking cards and accounts never works like it should or even like it did one time before. I had to replace my card, same card and company just a new numbers but it won't link the new information?! The card is allowed and supported but now I can't load money. Hate using this app unless it's completely my last resort!",
            "This app is a scam to me now unlike before that it's working well. When you download it it will be asking for your SSN. Its really frustrating. Some guys are patronizing themselves as customer care representatives all they do is hack your bank accounts and all your hard earned money is gone. The money sent to me can't be accessed too for the past 2 weeks. I don't encourage anyone to download this app",
            "Cashapp is GREAT! That is, until you have ANY problem with your account! Support is useless! I've sent FIFTEEN (15) emails in the last 2 days because I had to order a new card and I've been sent TWO (2) that don't match the new card info on my account, with only 2 responses, neither of which got the problem fixed, and nothing further from them. CASHAPP DOES NOT HAVE RELIABLE SUPPORT. IF YOU NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE, I WILL APPLY FOR THE JOB AND SHOW YOU HOW TO MANAGE A BUSINESS AND KEEP FANS!",
            "This app is horrible in scanning id. There is no button to use when taking a picture of front and back of id. The front i had to click on flash sign, the back side i had to close app and reopen to even see a flash sign and then when i clicked for back side, the functions changed ot just lit up id. The app took a picture on its own of back side as i was moving my id arpund for 30 min annoyed. And then it only took when i put super close, taking only an 8th of whole back side, twice!"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

I gave it a five start cause i really love the app and the one i am using is free mode what more premium membership wow so impressed with the creators of this app . Thank you for making this app kuji cam creators 😊❤️",
            "Great App. I've had a lot of fun with this on my trip to California. Something I'd love to see is RAW .dng support though. I like shooting editable photos in my professional camera app and throwing on filters later. RAW support would give me ultimate control and make importing easier for me.",
            "Changing my 5 star to 1 because I purchased the app before and now it looks like it wants me to purchase again? I've had this app for a while and it was actually good. I paid to unlock all the filters but for some reason its asking me to pay again. Is there a reason for this? Is this something that have to keep happening?",
            "Great for what I want in an editing app. I use the paid version (and it's thankfully a one time payment). I prefer this one over some of the other \"light-editing\" apps that I've tried :)",

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"
