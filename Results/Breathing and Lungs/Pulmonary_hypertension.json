            "This is the best app I've ever used out of any app. This app not only does as described but there's no hidden fees. It's easy to use, it keeps all info stored in a very neat manner. It also has an option to put all your inputs into charts that can be printed and/or emailed! If i could give 10 stars I would! Great app! I never leave reviews either, went out of my way for this one.",
            "Love the ability to store the info on my phone, then download it to my PC, or any of the other options this app affords, when I choose to. There's no website or online account to set up access to (AAA+ for that!). The data stays on my phone until I choose to put it somewhere else. All apps should be this user-friendly. Well done!",
            "This has been the best way for us to get my husband to keep track of his blood pressure. He showed his doctor who was impressed with the functionality of the app, especially the ability for my husband to email him the readings. As a student nurse, I have also shown this app to several of my patients who were impressed with how simple and easy to use it was. The only thing I could suggest is adding a spot to record temperature readings so all basic vital signs are recorded.",
            "Add a Temperature Field! Love this app! I never had to keep track of my blood pressure until I got very nervous and it spiked. I'm now on 2 medications & have home & work BP monitors. I used the free app, was very impressed and bought the regular app. Easy to use. The statistics are great. Writing Developers to see if they can add a temperature field.",
            "I've used this app daily for two years now and am very glad that I have. It has helped me lower my blood pressure and weight by being more aware of them. Finally paid, not so much to get rid of the irritating ads as to give credit where it is due. Early on, I found a way around the annoying ads which appear when you save a reading using the New Entry button. Otherwise I might have looked for another app. Use the History button instead and choose today's date. No ads!"

I was diagnosed in 2008 and made sure i followed Dr. Orders. Im doing better ans better. Thank you Dr. Feldman, i owe you my extended life. B. STOKLEY",

This does not just feel unnatural, it can even cause you to adopt an unhealthy way of breathing, which can lead to health issues. Beware, even some of the most downloaded apps make this mistake!\r\nBreath Ball's breathing is based on clinical observations of hundreds of humans. The app was specifically designed for clinical environments. That's why Breath Balls breathing exercises feel natural and work much better than any of the competing apps.\r\n⭐️ No quackery: Breath Ball is based on sound scientific research. New breathing exercises are added only when there is sufficient research data available.\r\nHowever, you can of course define your own breathing exercises and use Breath Ball for whatever you want.\r\n⭐️ Maximum customizability: Our well being highly depends on what we like and dislike. Breath Ball is the only app you can fully customize to your liking: Colors, breathing exercises and even the size of the user interface can be adjusted to give you the breathing app that feels just right for you.\r\n⭐️ Focus on simplicity: Breath Ball is incredibly easy to use and even the first breathing session usually leads to great results.\r\n⭐️ Free: Even the free version of Breath Ball provides all the functionality you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThese are the main reasons why leading medical professionals, therapists and biofeedback coaches use and recommend Breath Ball.\r\n\r\nWhat is Breath Ball used for?\r\nBreath Ball helps you to relieve stress and anxiety, soothe the symptoms of COPD and Asthma, lower high blood pressure and overcome sleeplessness with four easy breathing exercises. What might sound too simple to be true, is actually based on latest scientific research and is used to treat patients at rehab facilities and in clinical environments. So let's take a closer look at Breath Ball's breathing exercises and what they can do for you:\r\n\r\nBreath Ball provides breathing exercises for these four use cases:\r\n\r\n⭐️ The cardiac coherence breathing exercise is used to relieve stress and anxiety. It is thought to patients at rehab and bio-feedback trainings to help them get calm and relax.\r\n\r\n⭐️ The COPD foundation’s recommended breathing technique helps to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of Asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Slow paced breathing is a complementary treatment against hypertension (high blood pressure). It goes back to Prof. Dr. Loew and is commonly used in clinical environments.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Dr. Andrew Weil’s famous 4:7:8 breathing technique is used to get calm to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nEach of these breathing exercises comes with a short tutorial that will get you started in less than two minutes. Beside that you can create your own breathing exercises; something yoga and pranayama coaches enjoy a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy concerns?\r\nPlease note: We truly value your privacy. Breath Ball does not collect any of your personal data. There is no Facebook integration and there are no social sharing features included.

Upon completion of a longer time maybe an encouraging message like \"well done or you've improved \" to encourage people to return to the app? So good I recommended it to a friend who enjoys it :D thank you so much makers of this app !!😊 No account needed,yay !",
            "This app has potential, but presently has annoying glitches: 1) has several audible glitches in the audio (inhale and exhale cues), 2) no delayed start is available, 3) always asks confirmation before exiting (it should not do this unkess you are in the middle of a session. It should also provide the option to turn this confirmation off.)",
            "Visual of ball and adjustment of timing is great. But the audio glitches that make a crackling sound every time the audio cue happens makes this app unusable with the sound on. Yes, you can just turn the audio guide off, but the audio guide, without the glitches, would really add to the meditative experience and would allow you to not have to be looking at the ball 100% of the time."

Additionally, there are several natural ways to reduce elevated blood pressure, which involves healthy life- style changes.\r\n\r\nAn anti-hypertensive medication that is prescribed to patients is the thiazide diuretics. The thiazide diuretics are used to lower the resistance of the peripheral vascular or lower the pressure in the walls of the blood vessels.\r\n\r\nHowever, this drug is commonly known to help excrete sodium from the body; thereby lowering blood volume. Another anti-hypertensive drug is the peripheral vasodilators which reduce blood pressure by relaxing the force of contraction of the muscles in the heart.\r\n\r\nWhen prescribed, the dosages are dependent upon the status of the existing blood pressure and the seriousness of pre-existing conditions that increased the risk of developing it initially. Coincidentally, the dosages may be decreased once the blood pressure levels have been reduced.\r\n\r\nHealth care professionals also provide other advice on how to reduce blood pressure. Generally, they often recommend life- style changes that not only reduce the blood pressure, but also help reduce the persistence of annoying side effects caused by the medications. In most cases, the risks for high blood pressure are increased simply due to the decline in practicing healthy life-style regimens. Physicians advise hypertensive patients to eat a healthy diet, to loose weight, and to exercise daily. A healthy diet may consists of fruits and vegetables, foods rich in potassium, low calorie and low-fat foods and/or foods low in sodium.\r\n\r\nExercise may consist of walking, climbing stairs (as opposed to using the elevator), or yoga.

Here you will find Diet Tips To Reduce Blood Pressure \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet For High Blood Pressure and Hypertension, Relation Between Diet and Blood Pressure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have Bad eating habits then it contributes significantly to unhealthily high blood pressure levels, even in middle age, when blood pressure levels typically rise as part of the aging process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not you are taking antihypertensive drugs, the need to make dietary improvements (eg. follow a healthy low-fat diet) is frequently at the top of a doctor’s list of recommendations to reduce or prevent the onset of high blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore outlining the best type of diet for hypertension, let’s take a brief look at health consequences of raised blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHazards of Hypertension & High Blood Pressure\r\n\r\nIn under developed as well as developed countries, an estimated 20-40 percent of all adults suffer from persistent high blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart causing atherosclerosis(Thickenning of vessels). Result is damage to heart, Coronary artery disease, Kidney failure, Strok, Eye damage. Choice is yours, try to save these vital organs by controlling your BP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember Hypertension is a silent Killer, it shows its effects silently and when you come to know that you have BP, by that time hypertension often affects your vital organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal Blood Pressure Levels vs. Prehypertensive and Hypertensive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal blood pressure of an healthy adult at rest, is 120 (systolic) over 80 (diastolic) or less. Blood pressure levels greater than 120/80 and below 140/90 are at prehypertensive stage, while levels above 140/90 are considered hypertensive stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth prehypertensive and hypertensive subjects should make diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to reduce or prevent the onset of hypertension and reduce the risk of heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeight increases blood Pressure\r\n\r\nOver weight persons will be having high blood pressure. Weight reduction significantly decreases blood pressure.People with obesity double their risk of developing the disorder. In addition, roughly 7 out of 10 obese adults suffer from high blood pressure. If you lose even 10 pounds can produce noticeable improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDietary Advice and Tips For High Blood Pressure\r\n\r\nIf you have high blood pressure and not overweight, here are few tips to control your BP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose A Healthy Balanced Diet\r\n\r\nIf you want to reduce your blood pressure, your diet should be rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, while low in saturated and trans-fats. It should also be low in cholesterol, high in fiber, calcium,potassium and magnesium, and moderately high in protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Heart Association and U.S. government recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as a good diet guide to reduce blood pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to Reduce Your Intake of Sodium (Salt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow salt intake increases blood pressure. Eating too much salt or sodium-rich foods leads to a greater uptake of fluid and causes greater retension of water inside body, leads to volume overloard and High blood presure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also places extra strain on the arterioles (blood vessels that dilate/constrict to regulate blood pressure and blood flow). Both these effects lead to higher blood pressure. The Recoomended daily dose for sodium for most people is 2,400 mg. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can Reduce Sodium Intake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you decrease sodium intake? Eat less pre-cooked or processed food, and eat more fresh food. Sodium is found naturally in fresh foods like grains, fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, and dairy products, but in much lower quantities than in processed foods (eg. packet, bottled or canned food).",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",

I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",

But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together. And you can even have your family see if you’ve missed a med despite the pill reminder, so they can help you stay on track.\r\nMyTherapy is for you, no matter if you are taking antibiotic medicines or deal with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression that are often complicated.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",

My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either.

Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It was a great app. I had a few different tunings purchased. But now I am unable to restore my purchases. Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",
            "It actually tuned my guitar!!! also has loads of fun interactive games that help you learn/master chords",
            "Honestly this app is amazing no ads and pretty on point with tuning your guitar. Also have had no problems so far, and you don't even need to pay for the tuning part. Really recommend this for someone who is just starting out on playing guitar and wants to learn how to tune your guitar. Definitely 5 star! :)"

            "It's a good game, but only if you want to spam cards, been on this game for a couple years now. I've come and gone and they still have things that make it near impossible for non pay to win players to progress. If you want to progress you need to get powerful gear, a good way to do that is events. An event that requires a 300k gear score will one shot people with a 1m gear score. If your not looking to progress and just want to chill with random people, it's a good game to be on.",
            "The fact that I've been playing this game for ever since like four years ago and they still haven't fixed the neverending \"Now Loading\" screen is just... honestly, disappointing. You're forced to exit the game every two or three quests you do and the devs haven't done anything to change that. I came back for the sake of nostalgia but it's let me down once again. Annoying.",
            "The general overall experience of the game is good. Recent updates have however caused regular issues in game such as freezing and dodgy connections (which yes u have tested and aren't just my signal). The company clearly puts a lot of thought into new things to add to the game, I just feel they need to address bugs more because since the last lot were added, it's been months with no change, yet loads of new content for them to make money. Clearly their priority is money and nothing else",
            "Honestly, I fell in love with the game a few years back. I still enjoy it to a certain degree, but some things have been bugging me: 1. There are some minor glitches like people or monsters not loading. While it seems innocent, it becomes really inconvinient for Guild Battles and stuff. 2. Even though the devs tried to solve the issue, it's still an issue. The stronger the monsters, the more broken it is. Unisoning in Guild Battles is still broken as such. Please continue to resolve the issue!",
            "The game is pretty nice. The customization feels great and streamlined; easy to learn. One critique is that with more money, you can easily progress faster than everyone around you, akin to the problem Clash of Clans has. The gameplay feels nice and natural; along with the fun guild battle system. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to customize the party you quest with. I.E. Choosing whether or not to allow other CPU's to come with you. Overall, great game, fun time."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

SCHEDULE supports the retake of missed sessions in history now. Try and get more circles.<br>2. Another upgrade! Tap the screen to check the pose list while exercising. It&#39;s much easier to browse and switch poses now.<br>3. New Courses in November: Winter Energy Flow-Intermediate Element Yoga, Easy Morning Yoga.<br>Monthly Golden Day, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday are coming!",
        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",

            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option.

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

Hit what they consider a \"big win\" which can be quite often and guess what??? AD!!! Wanting you to multiply your winning by paying $4.99. I played for maybe 5 minutes and had to say \"No\" to so many pop-ups that I am uninstalling and never playing this game again.",
            "LOVE this slot game! I play a lot of slots, but usually delete them because you don't win and barely get enough in the daily bonus to keep playing. This one however is perfect! Lots of fun slots with different exciting bonuses on every slot (which is a must have for me, I don't like basic slots) and you ACTUALLY win! I LOVE it! Easy 5 star rating (:",
            "Early still, but it has cool slots and at least if you lose your ass, you can watch ads to earn yourself back into the game pretty quickly. That's a huge plus for me. I absolutely hate slot games that give a crappy bankroll to start and drains it in no time just to try to sell coin packages. We'll designed and big game selection too. Keep up the good work!",
            "I haven't seen \"buy this\" pop ups THIS awful since the late 90s just before pop up blockers were made to stop the disgusting greedy bs. This developer needs to get a grip. I was getting PAID to play this and try it out and I'm doing it is THAT bad. They need to rethink their policy on that. For real. Someone on their team probably deserves to be fired for this not happy nostalgia, this needs to stop. 100% trash till then. Update: just bc there's an x doesn't make the avalanch of pop ups okay.",
            "This game was great after I paid a couple bucks for a purchase to make ads go away (been playing nearly 2 yrs). But now, the Level Race and the Winning Cards are super annoying and interfere with tournaments. I get that you want to give people other options to get more coins, but you should also give players the option to opt out of these things. I buy the coins on my own and being harassed by these constant pop-ups is a deterrent. Once my coins are exhausted I'll likely just delete the app."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "A good strategy game, not too mechanically complex and decently challenging. A treat for fans of the series. Most of the negative reviews are people upset about being able to buy things. Look, all free games want your money. But FEH is pretty generous with what you get for free, has no ads, is from a trusted name, and no game mode is behind a pay wall. You can build up a deep bench of heroes and be competitive in PVP modes and never spend a single dollar.",
            "FEH is unfortunately plagued by many issues. If you're like me, and play for the characters you love, you won't have fun. I've spent hundreds of hours (and real money) collecting and upgrading my favorites, just for them to be outclassed by whatever new OP 5* of the week gets released. You have to pull a character 11 times to max out their power, ridiculous. It's all up to luck if you get the characters you want, and even if you do they'll probably suck. Play Three Houses instead.",
            "I love this game, and there is a ton of stuff to do in it. The amount of free orbs (the real money currency) you get seems to be decent. While I have some minor balancing issues with the game, the main reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the limit on inventory. There are 580 characters; why do we only get 300 slots before having to spend orbs? This has not changed since the launch of the game as far as I'm aware. I feel like we should have free slots equal to the # of different units",
            "As someone who spent 2 thousand on this game, i feel qualified to say: I cant believe advanced wars died to this franchise. Power creep. Bloated summoning pool. Terrible features. Predatory mechanics to spend money. If you like this stuff, then this is the game for you. Dont speak to me ever again, intelligent systems. Hit me with a generic automated response and ill hit ya with a KleanYoSelf",
            "Very fun and rewarding. Purchases are not needed for good characters but I do it anyway because the prices are actually reasonable. Edit: I was actually getting a new player new character summon boost I wasn't aware of back then. It is a little hard to get the characters you want without spending money, and sometimes even still so with spending, but if you are a Fire Emblem fan, it is still a very fun, challenging, and rewarding game."

Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",

Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",

I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",

But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard.

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "The overall system/hub is great. However, this app is slow and clunky. Classic was better. It takes some time to load everything on launch before I can do anything. Then, when you go into a device, there's only a tiny space on the sides to scroll. Otherwise, if you scroll in the middle fast, it won't scroll, gotta go slow and it looks like it wants to select an option. You simply cannot scroll past a color wheel for a light because you'll just be selecting a color instead of scrolling. Annoying.",
            "Could use a little work. Looks are better than the features. I wish for the oven connection, I didn't have to start while right in front of it and rather be able to at least start keep warm to get the oven started. Also that you have to stop oven to change which to a different setting then have to be once more right in front of oven to begin the new setting. I do understand it for security, but I think there should be a way to also disable temp for more secure homes.",
            "If anyone else in your home uses the app to do something on the tv it basically makes your app unusable for the rest of the day. My wife used it and I try to use it a few minutes later to change the settings on my tv and I'm stuck in an infinite sign in loop. It's stupid. Why even add a feature to add other accounts to the group if only one can even navigate the app at a time?",
            "Edit: Still not compatible with Android 11. I've been paying monthly for my smart Tracker service that I'm not able to use. This is unacceptable from such a large company. Not compatible with Android 11 can use my tracker anymore. Reached out to support and they told me an official version of Android is not supported... Reached out to support again and they said android 11 isn't supported because it's in beta. It hasn't been in beta for almost a month now and I can't use my smart Tracker.",
            "The app says we have to download an add on. I press download and it says we can't download it, contact us. I contacted several times and didn't get any feedback. Well done guys. Even when it works, the touchpad works only once !!! After that you have to restart the app to use the touchpad But, someone's you can't even stop the app."

            "The game is good, there's an offline mode and online mode, but to be honest, I like the old version of bomber friends especially the offline mode and I have a reason for it, 1. you don't have to pay diamonds or gems to upgrade your stats unlike the updated version",
            "This is a really good game. Multiplayer battles are of three types reversi, classic and team battles. There are also two dungeons and adventure modes, clan events and arena battles. It's really fun and there is 100% no lag (if there is that's your WiFi problem). I highly recommend all of you to download this game.",
            "Good but way too many be adverts when you first start the game and between levels before getting the bonus and watching an ad for double bonuses. Even failing some levels triggers a long ad you can't skip. This totally be ruins the flow of the game. Less ads would be better. Controls can be unresponsive at times leading to frustrating deaths also icons on the left too large with controls covering them they should be moved. Buff icon bomb kick too small easy to lay a bomb when trying to kick",
            "Hi I just wanted to bring to your attention that I lost so many points in Area Battle and I can't believe how fast they move and swap me in over the other side and walking through my bombs? I believe the players maybe using cheat code on me. Any ways you can investigate this problem and could I have my last 16 games points back that I lost so quickly by the players cheat code?",
            "After 4 years been playing this game.. Such enjoyable game but this time after the previous update..they came out with new boom/weapon what that called, and its not good and become ridiculous. Id like more for the old one before update, i have to uninstall it coz by the update not suitable for me and yeah gonna miss this game so much."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

Update today!",
        "comments": [
            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

Often doesn't record audio, images, videos and statuses, even if notifications are on and downloading media is fully on(wi-fi and mobile data). In play market, there's only one app that records (supposed to record and save) all deleted messages, and that's WAMR.(4 stars) 10/16/2020: It can't store data on sd card...(2 stars)",
            "Everything works fab !!! The only thing which needs to be fixed is : 1. Why does it recover the media which i deleted myself from gallery. 2. It just shows the statuses which i opened rather than showing all the statuses. 3. Lastly in the status section categorize it as photos & videos. Plz fix this, it will surely rock the app...",
            "Well the app is great. But sometimes it fails to recover media even when it is fully downloaded. And now it doesn't work because I moved the contents of WhatsApp to SD card. Please fix this error. Make it so that it can still show media when it is being downloaded to SD. Otherwise it is awesome.",
            "It should be able to capture those messages and media which I haven't seen or opened. Suppose I miss a message while I am sleeping, I should be able to get those messages even when the sender has deleted it.. Otherwise it works relly perfect. Thank you for all your hard work.",
            "It is very useful in the beginning but gradullay it cannot work properly the name we cannot saved in our contact he/she sent a message to whatsapp or any other medias if they delete the message we cannot see that I cannot get the notification i enable the notification i cant get it But sometimes it is very useful app to me I suggest to everyone in this app Thankyou"

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",

Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",

It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "The game is a good game, dont get me wrong. But there are 3 big things that are issues for me. One, is that the game is very complicated. There is so much stuff when you open the menu, I feel it would be better even if it was a little more \"basic\". Also, there are lots of ads, which I mean the game has to make money. Lastly, it needs a strong internet connection to play, and I feel an offline mode would be nice.",
            "I have been playing this game for over 3 years and I was just starting to get somewhere with a purchased rod and reel. The posiden rod 5 stars stats were rather good then with a successful evolution to a 6 star rod it gives me garbage stats I would expect from a 3 star rod and no way to go back to my previous rod. The stats on evolution should be a comparison or better of the 2 rods your using to improve the one you already have. Not the garbage it gave me. You could answer your emails.",
            "Really cool option to play as if your phone is an actual fishing pole W/ phones gyro. You progress quickly & are given enough free loot to start and keep the game going as you progress to earn higher level equipment and achievements. Graphics are great, controls are very easy and straight forward. Also very accurate in the depiction of the different types of fish that you would actually catch. Game accurately depicts the fish that are indigenous to the areas you fish in the game. Overall GREAT!!",
            "If you cant play for a while you will lose your guild and all the money and hard work you put in will be give to someone on your team and they wont talk and don't fish much this suck by far thus the 1 star rating a bot in control of my guild you email for help and they tell you its nothing they can do you have to w8 till person misses 20 days or more im pissed as all hell because I worked at the hospital when rona popped up and had to work doubles i had no time to check in. I want all my $ back",
            "It should have higher quality graphics setting. Good game, but the graphics is still stuck in 2014. It doesn't look good on a FHD screen."

            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "Started okay but the later levels are near impossible to complete given the number of explosions on the screen when you hit a ball, can't see anything and therefore can't move out of the way quick enough. Update: Having played the game for a while longer, I'm frustrated because the follow options are not working: - Being able to select \"Extra Cannon\" in the store. When selecting it it says \"Can't connect to the store, please check your connection. My connection is fine. The other 2 options in the store take a while to activate once you enter the store: - Free Heart option by watching a video - x50 diamonds by watching a video. If these options are time delayed, it would be handy to show the countdown.",
            "Too many ads. Literally 1 after every level. Plus, the game input is laggy, so your cannon is always behind where you're touching on the screen. These people suck at making video games. I hope they die of cancer. France is the worst country in the world. Only losers live there.",
            "This app is very cool & fun to play. Very challenging. As compared to other games it contains very ads. Sounds and colours also add some spice. After if you add all of this it is the perfect game I have ever played!!!. This game is also rated for all ages which I really liked about it.",
            "This game is very addictive and all of that but I gave it 3 star because once I get out of the game and I return the next day....it begins to freeze while playing and I have to keep restarting the game every time. Up until It stops and go back to normal...but like I said this is wu-an-derful...keep it up. This thing also blacks out...and to much ads",
            "It's a very hard game but addicting at the same time, since the new updates this game has wayyyyyyyyyy to many AD's. And try to find away were we can save from where we left off if we ever decide to delete the game."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get it😊",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",
            "Great game ever but it had a connection problem and more of bugs after this update please resolve it. And other thing is that we want to purchase diamonds there is no other way. And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",

I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Was fun for awhile but get to the end it takes weeks to get more levels. The daily gifts never get better the longer you play. Last update has the banners across game almost impossible to move and stuck on 1872 with last phase there are no diamonds to actually pass the level. Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",
            "I like this app. Actually I am playing this game since 2017... What I like the most is there is NO ad that will pop up... even your Wifi is on... there will never be an irrititation in this game😍",
            "The game is relaxing and cute, and so far I haven't been bombarded with ads!",
            "It's not good when the computer will not give you a match to make anywhere near the goal. I don't spend money on games. Some companies are money grubbers!!!",
            "This game is a random game, I like it for the fact that it makes you think but as an offset it drops stuff you can not think about. If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

        "comments": [
            "It's a fun game most of the time. Addictive, too. But sometimes the game seems determined to take all your coins back, and I don't know if that's on purpose to make you buy more, or what? Edited: After gaining more experience in the games, and winning quite a bit, I do appreciate the \"lifelike\" experience, but still find certain things a little frustrating, such as a challenge to get 40 Sloto Card Stars to complete my Daily Dash, and taking until 11:59 pm to be awarded enough Cards to finish.",
            "GLITCHY THEIVES! The game was fun until it started to glitch! Then the reels would spin and not stop. I updated it hoping it would be better but it just made it WORSE! I tried to turn in my stars for a spin on the Super Wheel, not only did the wheel not stop spinning but once the error message appeared my cards and stars were GONE! I didn't get any prizes for them or compensation! Like I said, GLITCHY THEIVES!!",
            "It's good that there is no ads to worry about. The game flow is fine. But if I decide to put money into this game I find no real gain from it. Game goes into immediate lockdown. It will run me right out of the coins I paid real money for. This isn't a real casino. I dont stand to win real money. If I pay for chips I expect to get a boost out of the game instead of being shutout. Not a good business model. You can change your algorithms on your game. Make it worth players time. We pay. You don't.",
            "As John Goodman says you never know what today will spin! It is an exciting game, the graphics are great and you are not constantly interrupted by ads! I count some of the people in my clan as friends, we play as a group on challenges and it is competitive fun! New games and challenges keep it fresh! Once you play Slotomania, you will not want to play other slots games. It's that good! The seasonal games and prizes are terrific! Grafics are terrific!!!",
            "I'm through buying anything in this app. Real life happens to everyone. In the last three days of NOT buying, I've received a star spin in half hours and hour spins ONCE !!! can tell you when I was buying, it was almost Everytime spin stars. They let me know how they are I'm a level 2679 !!!! I'll still play with my clan, but No More Buying !!!!!"

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "This was my go-to app until about a month ago. I have to go out and then reload it frequently to get the current info. It often gets stuck at a time hours earlier. It's raining and it does not note that. Another app has 37% chance of rain in my current location (which is about right), and this app says 6% while it rains. I'm uninstalling it in favor if a better, more accurate app. I rely on relative accuracy with updates because I plan outdoor activities.",
            "The widget has started routinely saying \"weather data not available\". When it does actually show the weather, it is usually not current, actually showing the weather from hours & hours ago. Also, it takes a really long time to start up, which it didn't used to do. Whatever \"improvements\" have been made to this app have been horrible, & have made it much slower & much worse than it used to be. I'm looking around for other options, so I can unload what has unfortunately become a major turkey.",
            "I had this app for years and it began to have really low speed opening up. I uninstalled it and went with another app. The speed on it was fine, just had a lot of ads. I went back to The Weather Channel app hoping it had improved. IT HAS NOT!!! It just keeps spinning and draining my battery. It's been 15 minutes and still spinning. Poor, poor performance. Not pleased with this at all.",
            "TOO MANY ADS!! There is a ad that you are forced to watch after every video!! Also the sound quality is VERY POOR on almost every video, then the ad comes on and is extremely loud. It's annoying to have to constantly adjust the volume level for every video and ad! This app has been getting worse with every update!! The other weather apps are much better and more detailed. Sorry Weather Channel but I think I will be uninstalling your app now and I don't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Wish I had never updated this app. My old weather channel app was so much better. Every time I try to shrink the map, there's very little to no response. I have to tap the screen and then try to shrink the map so I can see a broader View, but almost every time I do that, the app has to restart. The old map showing national weather would respond very well to the touch of my fingers. Not so anymore."

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

So I don't know what happen since the recent update on the app. Please fix it or is it something else with my printer. I have network and wifi is good. So is it the app?",
            "Even after the latest update, most features, including the all-important scan from printer, are now unavailable, rendering my expensive printer worthless. It tries to connect me with HP Web Services (which past versions never required), which then gets me an \"invalid request\" error every time. Awful, awful, awful app. Nonexistent support from HP. Avoid!",
            "Terrible. Absolutely awful. It worked for a while and now I can't connect my device to the printer because it claims I am not on the same network or something. HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",
            "Rendered useless come on HP what have you done to the app. It no longer is working and I need so much done doe work. This is so inconvenient especially working at home with no other access. This printer was bought to be used. Please fix the. There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",
            "Same here. It was working great then I tried to print a recipe from my phone the other day and it won't work. I have checked settings, passwords, IP addresses. It shows it is there but it can't find it. I have disconnected, unplugged and am just over the whole frigging mess."

None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant.

            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",
            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",

Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "I have used on my computer forever! On the phone it won't download directly to my music player like other torrents do... so when I manually go and allow access for every single download.... it only selects a few to add to my phone.... you can listen on the app if you into that... or just go download a less known but somehow better \"flud\"..... bye bye ButtTorrent 👋 also lots of ads....",
            "I am seeing less full screen ads but what actually I hate is the fact that there is no notification to see if BitTorrent is downloading or not or how much download has completed. Also, if I am to get so much ads, I might as well go back to TorrDroid as the ads there are fewer and skippable.",
            "I am very disappointed of this app and the u torrent app, 'cause i wanted to download some movies and i found the apps of yours, and guess what?!?! It doesn't works, when i opened the apps i automatically closes and i reinstalled still doesn't work so i had to delete those apps. I did not found this app useful, i wanted to rate 0 stars, but i can't. When you fix this problem i will download this app!!!",
            "(Still not fixed, clear cache, Uninstall reinstall, power cycle, still cannot remove old torrents) It has an annoying glitch that does not remove torrents, ive contacted support, done all of their fixes and it seems to get worse, only started happening when the new features were introduced",
            "Started out great. Now every torrent I try to download pauses every few seconds and I havent changed any of the settings. Very frustrating as soon as my download reaches its maximum speed it pauses and starts over"

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",

I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",

The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely?

Then, with 128 Gb sd-card, or cloud storage, it would be unstoppable!",

Give us a basic and scientific button to toggle between the modes.. PS to the people complaining about the clear, press and hold the backspace button and it will clear",

I don't use the scientific operations, so looking at them all the time is visual clutter. VERY ugly app. Lastly, in all that clutter you can't give us a memory +/recall key OR a simple clear/all clear key. You know, keys that are found in just about EVERY calculator anyone has ever used EVER. /smh",

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "The only reason I'm not rating it a 5 star is because of how many ads their are. Also, the game will freeze and turn pitch black so I have to try and rejoin. Mostly it's decent but there is a lot of bugs when I play, I can't really play the game. Please try and fix this :(",
            "Do not buy game!!!! It's absolutely ridiculous how many ads there are and they do that too force you to purchase the no ads package. It's so bad you can't even enjoy the game because after every question there's an ad. I used to enjoy this game but they ruined it because they got so selfish with money and messed it up for everyone. Congratulations creators, you ruined a game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD",
            "I've played this game for years and loved it until now. Game offers rewards but commercial will freeze or keep blinking until it freezes and you have to shut it off and restart and loose reward. Game makes it impossible to get lives. I feel that I'm being forced to buy lives. Also blinking commercials could make people have seizures. Eventually I'll have to quit game if I don't have lives. Make it fair again.",
            "Trivia Crack helped improve not only just my language skills... but also my IQ. It has taught me things that i would have never learned anywhere else. I AM ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED!!! The game could run a little smoother & not crash so many times. That's the only down fall to Trivia Crack. Thank you for taking the time to create such a BRILLIANT game! I will FOREVER be your #1 fan!🖤 .🖤. 🖤.✌",
            "The amount of ads is ridiculous, it is not worth all the wasted time on ads just to play the game. Also, over the last week there has been 5-6 times when I have selected the right answer and the game shows me that it was the right answer and then I immediately get sent to collect my 30 coins for losing. Clearly there is something wrong here."

New challenges, pretty nice, if they didn't run entire days of legendary fish that most people don't have. I'm sure there are more casual players that enjoy the game, that wouldn't mind being rewarded. Just a thought. Recommend for wasting time. Progressing or competing, not so much.",
            "this game was fun at first, but it is just a money pit now. The events are only attainable by those with fat wallets. And when the game goes down for more than a day, they give you a booby prize as compensation. Won't be spending any more money or time on it. My advice is don't play unless you're rich and famous IRL",
            "Was brilliant. Have spent over £100 on this game. It's a fix!! You will constantly keep spending money. You'll never have what is needed until you spend, spend and spend more. It lags, freezes and you lose items you have paid for for this. I have contacted them and nothing!! Or they state nothing is wrong. Completely disgusting. What a waste of money!!",
            "I was on level 59 entering 60! Played two months & was winning big, smooth clan, and BAM! Game Updated & started me completely over! Customer support wasn't available to help me get back where I was. Im not starting over at level 1 again. I put too much time n effort into this game. I was logged into Facebook account and Google! It didn't save my process! So I'm deleting the game! Good luck new players. It will happen to you. I was starting the Halloween theme! It really socks! No game 😕"

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

I am glad I did I'm having fun but can't figure out why the turret control overlaps the driving controls? Good job with this game and would like to see another soon. Thank you devs.",
            "Honestly, I love this game! This is the best tanki online, i've ever play! Everything about this game is amazing The gameplay , graphics and controls. Played a few. Fuel always a problem but this one lets you play! I have had some bugs while in this game (like the game not bringing you back to lobby, just showing a loading screen), but they are not too bad! Good tanks game online🌏",
            "Hi there it's a good idea of Modern Tank game but I have some suggestions for developers Number 1. improve graphics 2 HUD. 3 let MBTs in genrations like 1st gen MBT or 2nd gen ....4 clan or squad concept in witch player can play with other members .. plz think about my suggestions and improve in next several updates if possible and thanks again for reading my suggestions. ... Best of luck.",
            "Worst game ever, First of all you can't move the turret up and down which sucks A LOT, The game GUI and HUD sucks, It's really bad, It looks like a game from 2005, And when you aim at someone the turret sensetivity somehow increases significantly, I'm playing at 60 fps but the enemy vehicle is extremely laggy, My internet connection is ultra fast, But the enemy vehicle is so laggy, Game needs a lot of work and improvements. I do n't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Spent real money on this game and tried to play today and my profile is gone and all purchases are gone. I would like either this fixed or a refund. The game creator wont do anything. This is a rip off company that steals money. Been over a week and they will not do anything right."

I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",

            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

Have been playing for a long time! I've made it past over 300 levels but this entire time it's kind of been a lackluster game compared to some of 'your' others",
            "Its always challenging to figure out how to defeat a level. The only levels I really dont enjoy are the ones where there are chains over the buckets and you have to hit a matching color \"face\" thing to open it and the \"face\" changes color and changes which bucket it opens.That one is too confusing trying to figure out the pattern without wasting pears to shoot.",
            "Simple and fun,but there are some REALLY hard levels that can take even days to beat,such a simple and long game shouldn't have such hard levels. There should be an option to skip levels for free if,for example,you fail to beat it in 10 - 15 lives or maybe even less.",
            "I click the little circle on the top right corner and it says to put my fb information and when I do , says invalid token access .. what does that mean? why can't I see which level my friends are on ? Please fix",
            "It's an entertaining and addictive game, but it has some major cons. You only get 5 lives and you have to wait a certain amount of time before they regenerate, even though this game is clearly designed to make you constantly fail and replay levels. 5 lives is not enough, a game like this shouldn't even be using the \"lives\" format, it just ruins the experience and makes me stop playing since I have no more lives. This game is all about luck, not skill, which is extremely annoying and lazy."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "It's a good app but it keeps pausing and then it starts to.. Glitch? But when it does it makes me really mad and then it's really hard to try and fix without it pausing and going again and it doesn't have a couple of songs that I really like but other than that this is a great app speaking of which I'm actually listening to music from your app right now called karma😅😂but I do recommend this app and it doesn't include any signing in and it's actually free!!",
            "I honestly love the app. No ads to interrupt the experience, and you can add 1 song to a playlist to keep looping it. And you can add songs from other apps! I recommend the app to anyone who enjoys listening to music while also using other social media apps and games! Though, the only thing that bugs me is if there is 1 spelling mistake in the search, it wont give you results. Other than that, I love the app!",
            "THANK YOU!! dude theres NOTHING wrong with this app and ive been looking for something like it for a long time! Ive had this app for a year now and the ads arent annoying at all! Theres only ONE! How awesome is that?! You also get the option to use local audios and its AMAZING! EVEN EQ! theres an option to loop, favorite and MORE! 5 STARS on yelp. you deserve it.",
            "Definitely recommended. Highly. I've found a lot, if not, all my music here. It even plays the music over apps as you play games. No bugs, glitches, or audio issues. This is the perfect music app in my opinion with no confusing navigation.",
            "I love this app! I didnt know how to create my own playlist at first but I eventually figured it out after a few months of use. Awesome app! Except for one problem. Ads ads ads. Too many ads. Wish I could give 4 and a half stars though. But its still awesome. Another thing. I discovered the music keeps pausing and playing."

            "It was all fine until I had to transfer to YouTube Music, which to listen to music properly, requires a subscription. But YouTube didn't transfer my music, it just didn't work, which is frustrating. They don't care about people's satisfaction in listening to music, they only care about gaining money through subscriptions. Google Play Music was good, see that key word, was. YouTube Music doesn't need my money so I could listen to my music. It needs better function.",
            "It was working fine. I could happily listen to music offline. I honestly think that YouTube Music is really pointless since there's already a bunch of songs, covers, and instrumentals on YouTube itself. This is only getting a 1 star review and I have no actual regrets. Honestly who was dense enough to think of this idea, they should've known that no one would like this idea, it's such a fraud. If we now need internet to listen to music then that's really dumb. Have fun reading all the reviews",
            "Used the app a lot from the get go. Worked perfectly. I put all of my purchased/downloaded music on it for about 3-4 years. Then, the app was \"moved\".... along with all of my music. 3 years worth of music erased completely. I'm pretty disgusted.... so much, that I don't even want to give YouTube music a chance once I saw that my music wouldn't transfer. Not one song. All of my playlist titles are there... but no songs. I've tried multiple times and searched extensively. It's a complete RIP off.",
            "I have been using this app for years, even I changed phones. And I am happy to use it even when offline. The last time I used this app was yesterday before updating. Then I realized the app is discontinued and becomes Youtube Music. The wonderful memories and arranged music just gone. Well, it is nice while it lasted and it's time to move on. Goodbye.",
            "This app was perfect. Loved the format. Very user friendly. Love the fact that I could play music on my phone while phone was asleep or when using other apps. YouTube music sucks . I have to keep my phone awake while using. Also I can't easily play my personal music downloaded to my phone. Ill pay for Google music if I have to. How can I get it back? F your commercials, F your format, change something that was flawless. I will never listen to any music on YouTube music."

Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent 😋 and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old 😁 ❤❤❤❤❤",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

            "Worst printer app. Very unreliable. Everytime I want to print something it says my printer is not available. 90% of the time it doesn't work. Makes my printer useless. Very frustrating. Not the first time Canon apps have disappointed me. Had the same problem with their camera app. I'll be thinking twice before buying another Canon product. Even if it's a good deal.",
            "Not \"quick and easy\" or functional... Installed the app. Upon opening the app, a static instructional page is displayed telling me to print from outside the app. Moving on to print a document, I select the canon option that now appears from the list of printers and get a nearly blank screen asking for the printer's IP address (unable to be detected itself from it's WiFi function) Searching Canon's troubleshooting page, I end up printing out a configuration page from the printer's menu, and I type in the IP address from a sheet of paper. The confirmation button stays greyed out. My only option is to cancel and delete the app. Because apparently it's just a waste of time.",
            "I'm disappointed that double-sided printing is not supported. The option is present but greyed out. I raised the issue with Canon support but their unhelpful response was \"if the option is greyed out then it is not supported\" even though the printer does do double-sided printing when used with other products, just not the Canon Print Service!",
            "The latest update removed functionality of the print service for me and my MG6220. The app/service (which now needlessly forces an icon into the Apps list) no longer automatically finds my printer, and when I try to manually find it by IP address, the app opens a numeric-only keyboard (no way to input decimal points for the address!).",
            "I will Never buy another Canon anything again!!!!! When I first got the pixma it worked pretty good. But ever since August it has a mind of its own! It will print one page then grab 50 pieces of paper at once from the paper tray! The next time it won't print at all. I got the Ivy cliq ( for free) and it works on its own but to try and get it to print pictures from your phone? Forget it. I give up! Done with Canon!!"

            "Fixed game. Very disappointing! The developer says that the distribution of pieces is random. Bull! After you get to a certain score, you'll never get a diagonal pattern in the initial distribution. Later, if you need pieces going vertically, you're given horizontal ones, if you need one going to the left, you only get pieces to the right. If I had this kind of luck in Vegas, if never go back, but even there they throw you a bone every once in a while! It's not just me, either. My wife and frien",
            "This game is awesome. Super addictive, however, it would be nice if the game didn't deal me the exact opposite of a set if blocks i need. Feels like you're playing against \"the house\". It's bad enough that i play frequently, and i see the pattern. \"Here's the perfect block for you\" but you can't use it cuz its rotated or flipped the exact opposite way it's needed. Fix this and i could mindlessly play but it's starting to get boring. 5 star awesome game to keep your mind busy otherwise",
            "Min 8 sec on only 1 or 2 adds before X shows. Then 30 or more on the rest. You need to correct this Fun game. But when the ads last longer than the game itself (after every game) and pop up ads while playing is incredibly STUPID! Takes the enjoyment out of the game. Edit, I am even getting push notifications now. Started right after I made this review!",
            "This is a fun game but you should make it where we can rotate the pieces. Otherwise it's almost impossible to get very far. I'm uninstalling for now and will check back in the future to see if you change that feature. Till then there are other tetris type games that let you rotate.",
            "I think this game would get a lot better if it had the option to store a piece rather than forced to play it. Just one piece like Tetris. Else wise it sets you up to lose. It addicting to try and beat your own score but it'll be frustrating at times."

            "I thought I was gonna give it another chance but it's way to pay to win. If you guys could lean more towards the free-to-play players and set it a pay-to-win players then this game will be way bigger. You guys add a new character like every month how are free to play players supposed to get those characters? Every time a new character comes out I have 100 Shino bites but it's like 500 to summon that doesn't make sense. Y'all won't see this cuz I drowning in money. Free-to-play games are best!!!",
            "I love this game. It gives you all characters at the beginning and gives you easy chances of earning their cards and developing your village expeditiously and the graphics are amazing. Anything with Naruto I live for and I'm glad I have happen to be introduced to this game. But my problem is that the game consistently logs me out making me have to use the game's currency (Shinobite) just to restore my energy. Other than that I enjoy it and look forward to more ideas unfolding in the game!",
            "Please fix the S.A.M. Event. This is the 2nd time I'm unable to play properly as the game crashes when the mission starts. I already contacted the support team for this before and tried their advise on clearing the cache from the game itself, but the issue persists. And from the looks of it, I'm not the only one having the issue. I actually enjoy this game but the crashing issue with S.A.M. is irritating. Please fix it!",
            "Despite the constant kick out from attack missions, the game is overall good, just gotta work on the app to where it wont kick players out of the attack missions. I am aware that there are others battling the same issue, so im adressing me as well as the others that battle the same issue. The sam missions will not work for me and the team missions for the Naruto ( kumara link mode) aren't working either, please fix these issues for other players and me.",
            "So unfortunate, such great potential, such poor delivery! Now more P2W than ever! Well laid out and easy to navigate with plenty to do and lots of useless characters. New characters are going to be p2w walled requiring upto 8000 Shinobites, which are priced sooo absolutely insanely high for what you get. Psuedo \"daily\" missions never seem to reset, so they should just call them \"monthly\" missions. Ai pathfinding is terrible. A fun game that could be great if they care to actually fix problems..."

When they have there specials to and you buy do not expect to have your chips for long you will lose it as soon as u buy it.

In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

I can't hear any music play at all rather it's the entry song ,or the music for the jukebox , please fix it , also I can't into the market place even if my WiFi conction is on ,and working right . Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",
            "Really an amazing game. I've never found a game that's better than minecraft! I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",
            "I love this app. I have played it for many years but recently it hasn't been working. Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",

It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "Used to love this game. Hadn't played in a little while and wanted to play again. Saying the ads are excessive is being kind. The free version didn't used to be like this. It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long add🤬🤬🤬🤬",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

        "comments": [
            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "I haven't seen much of the series, but what I did see was very quirky and endearing. This game is pretty fluid to play, but is a typical rock/paper/scissors type based strategic rpg. Lots of content to keep you busy, and no energy, unlimited attempts to clear levels. The code is well composed, I have yet to encounter a glitch. Can't speak for the value of money spent, but it seems like there are probably good deals. This is definitely a worthwhile rpg if you're a fan of one punch man.",
            "I've been playing the game for about 2 months, at the beginning it was really good but there's certain point if you're just a normal player that doesn't spend money on the game it feels frustrating and almost impossible to keep progressing on the game, I'm not against micro transactions, this is a free game after all, but prices are ridiculous high even higher than in 3A games for console or pc, devs should really pay attention to that",
            "Why add events outside the game? You need more events in game for free players. You guys have a Battle pass(can only be bought with real money), monthly subscription,Daily/weekly/monthly purchases and on top of that you offer \"sales\" when you level up. The game focuses on creating different events that you need multiple teams to win but the game is stingy at giving free rewards to assist with leveling up. Daily/weekly rewards aren't worth anything once you hit level 100+.",
            "Good anime,funny story. I usually quit when I hit a wall playing mobile games because I don't like to pay real currency for things I can't touch.(Hah I've got $ so I'm the best player). Games are supposed to be challenging and that is exactly what is fun about them. Developer's need to get payed as well It is only natural. Perhaps some people think they are greedy but in comparison to others they are not so much. I can still play and I have progressed and grown with patience and skill just fine",
            "Love the game everyone that is looking to play a pvp and a great RPG game then this is what you are looking for. Great game and I love it. EDIT: now I have been playing for 3 months I have seen that it is hard to be good at this game bc you have to pay to win most of the time and the epic drop are slim to none but after all of this it is still a fun game to just login on and play"

            "This app deserves 6 STARS!!!! I love the fact that it gives you the option to list apps from most recent to oldest. I usually share apps using wifi direct between my samsung phones, and this app has never let me down. Does not affect battery life on none of my phone, which was my primary concern. An app that doesn't consume (much) battery isn't certainly doing any background activity. It's a free app, and a good one too; therefore the least I can do is to write this sort of lengthy review, lol.",
            "This is a very good app. There is a SELECT ALL but it's not obvious, long press any single apk, then tap select all context menu. It's also a little odd that there is no save option only share but that's not too much of a problem since you can share to your a file explorer with the added advantage that you can save to any location that you choose at the time rather than a default folder. Overall a very good app.",
            "I'm always skeptical about these kind of apps because they keep promising things and don't deliver. I tried other apps and no luck but this app worked instantly, I'm actually amazed. I transferred an app to my tablet from my phone via WiFi direct and it worked. Now I'm using the app on my tablet. Thank you app developers for making a genuinely easy app to use and that works what it was intended for. I had to write this to let others know. Thank you once again.",
            "I hate it.when i use this app and the transfer finished the other device need to install it say \"app not installed\" and i try it again \"app not installed \"plss fix it.",

        "comments": [
            "Overall, I really enjoy the app but its not without its flaws. I understand that you need premium to remove the watermark but it does not need to be that freakin' large on the screen. Also there should be more variety with the text and effects; the options are good but not really enough. The positives with PowerDirector are unlike these other video editing apps, this has always been easy to use and the options aren't confusing to figure out. I'd recommend this app for starter youtubers!",
            "I used to rate this app with 5 stars, but just before I wrote this review, I was editing a video, and I found a lot of bugs, but the one with most impact is that it usually stops the video for a while between transitions, and that's really annoying because it would make a delay between the main video and the voiceover. Please fix this bug, it didn't use to be like this.",
            "FACT: There is no better video editing app out there for mobile platforms. It's fast, has tons of options and is considerate of phone resource usage. I edit all my YouTube channel videos with it. To see what can a small example of what can be done, check out some of the more recent videos on my channel \"WalkingtheSabbathTalk\". All videos edited with this mobile app.",
            "Update: when they updated this app it now fails to play back any edited video you may be working on . Audio and video is out of sync and very choppy. Impossible to use. Needs to be fixed or I will finish off my three-month subscription and go elsewhere. I do love the editor but the problem I'm having is that my MP4 video files are not being accepted. Some are and some aren't. That for me is the deal breaker. I'm not going to pay a subscription anymore if I have troubles with it.",
            "Broken from last update. App crashes constantly. I can't edit anything. The moment I try, the app closes. (Even trying to change my subscription, I get a spinning wheel of death.) I have a new phone with plenty of storage and memory. This was pretty user friendly before. Now it's completely unusable. And a waste of money. Edit in response: Of course I tried restarting it. I also restarted my phone multiple times. This app made my phone heat up to a dangerous degree. I'll revisit if fixed."

Does anyone know of a solution, or when we can expect a fix??? Please?!?!?!",

Was so happy before with ease of printing emails from my phone to my HP printer - so convenient! But now I have to pull out my laptop, wait to load emails and then print. With my background in testing, how did this update get into production? Or maybe you knew and shipped it anyway!",

No setting on my phone or removal of application would correct the issue. The note 20 ultra was printing all. The Note 10 was not nor was the z fold 2. This is F ed up. Samsung said they would get back to me in 2 days or so.",

I'm very satisfied user,",
            "Only 5 minutes ago (12.40 hrs) I downloaded this app, because my new Huawei p20 Pro was not printing, but I was able to print the same item using my laptop. I have the HP 5520 all in one printer, I printed off the test page which printed BLANK! GOOD START. I have just tried another 2 different prints, both blank pages.. That's from 9/10/18, not used the printer for a while 6 months at least, same bloody thing, no printer, yet it's on your listing, rint page = chuck out blank pages , uninstalled",
            "Used to be awesome Update killed my canon mf240. Support only offered a canned response. Thought it was the phone, tried a brand new phone with the same result... It was fine till the update, nothing wrong on my end. It will connect and recognize the printer over WiFi and direct-connection but when you get to the print screen the icon to start print (blue printer icon) is gone!! Checked print services, cleared cache, all should be well and it's not!! Please fix!!!",
            "Been using this app both on my fire tablet and for the last few days on my Moto G5. It appears to be working VERY well on both devices. Does everything that I want. 5*. Update: Some months later. This app is still working well and has caused no problems at all. Thoroughly recommend."

            "I really love this game. I love the variety of songs. I did not give a 5 star because of the gameplay. You can't click two notes at once which is kind of frustrating, unlike other music games. As much as its kind of challenging, I find it really annoying and bothersome. I hope this can be improved. Likewise, this game is 10/10 if ignoring the problem",
            "It's not a bad game; in fact, it's quite fun. However, every few notes, the note won't register a tap or will glitch and will register too late, causing a level to fail. Now, this would be fine if it happened every once in a while, but it happens predictably and can be incredibly infuriating when you're super close to finishing a level and don't want to watch an ad only to have it happen again.",
            "This game is fun to play if you're interested in songs and musical things and better than most piano music games, well this is only my opinion so if you are reading my comment/review on this music app I recommend to go ahead and download this app and give it a go! If you do dislike it or find something not to your liking then you can comment/review (Like me) on what you want the creators to fix or add. It's free and you can always delete it anytime! So give it a go! Who knows you might like it!",

I love it bcs it have so many anime and kpop song that I wanna play in piano so bad ^^ also can u please add Haikyuu openings and endings song? thnk you (/^-^)/ ( sorry if my english is bad (^～^;)ゞ )",

The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "The best non intrusive translation app I've ever used thus far. Translated text, SMS, photos, and the new features as of Sept I1 is translating spoken languages. I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

        "comments": [
            "I love it, I got scammed a while back in a raffle but other than that it's a really fun game. It's fun to see that it has been updated and kept alive, it does warm my heart! It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

Also it constantly shows that the printer isn't online, and I keep having to click back and forth before it works",

Update: have gotten a new HP Printer with Bluetooth capabilities! Only problem I have is printing every other page as a I don't have a duplex to print both sides in sequence! Gerrr! Otherwise I am a happy camper! :-) BTW, haven't tried it with my newer phone, yet.",
            "Works for the most part, but everytime I want to print to my HP printer I have to select the Save to PDF option first and then select the printer again. Otherwise it just tells me that the printer is offline or unavailable. I know its not offline, because I am able to get it to print.",
            "Horrible experience if you're trying to connect a droid phone to a wireless printer without having wifi. To get the manual for a new printer, you have to first get the app and connect. You have nothing to walk you through the process until you can get your phone and printer to sync. By that time, you've done it by yourself anyway.",
            "I reloaded the app and made sure the ink monitor reminder is off. Since HP blocks refilled HP ink carts,plus tells you need to order ink,when you have alot of ink left. I have learned by these pop ups from HP not allow HP to monitor any HP products. .I have- Less conflicts and false notifications to purchase unnecessary products through HP."

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "Great system, really handy for the whole family!!! It would make more sense though if you had to tap and hold the items to remove them from the list and just tap once to edit... So basically the other way around. Because the way it works now it happens to us quite often that we accidentally remove items from the list. But other than that, super happy with the app :)",
            "Okay so I've used it for the first time for shopping yesterday, and yeah random things did get added to my list. It was frustrating because it was items that we go through regularly and it made us doubt if we actually needed it or not. Also I wish the inspiration page was bigger. I wish there were 100s of recipes you could search for rather than there be the same 5 recipes on a list. Over all I love the idea of this app, but it needs some work. I'll keep using it for now.",
            "Great app and would normally give it five stars but recently the Wear OS app doesn't seem to be sending notifications? It's strange as I can get notifications from Bring! to my phone when the Wear OS app isn't installed but obviously can't view my list on my watch without the app. But when I install the Wear OS Bring! app on my watch the notifications no longer come through. Any ideas? Have made sure all relevant notification permissions are set up on both the Watch and Phone apps so I don't think the issue is there.",
            "Great app. We live far from town and sometimes one of us will head out to do the shopping. Anything I miss from our shopping list can be sent automatically from my wife's list and vice versa. This is how web based apps should all work.",
            "Amazing grocery/shopping list app.. why? 1) Share lists easily for others to add to 2) Google assistant integration for hands free operation 3) WearOS support 4) stores your loyalty cards in one place 5) clean and intuitive interface 6) responsive development team 7) always improving and incorporating user feedback."

Though as of today 10/08/2020 I went to use it to work on some things and noticed it has mysteriously uninstalled itself. But guess what - I installed it RIGHT back lol😄.",

So we can easily check the correctness of the calculation without going to the history window. Also while using scientific calculator I have to rotate the mobile. It is annoying and it is very difficult in field condition.",

We update every week, so keep checking this space for new features and other nifty stuff. <br>  <br>New and Not-so Noticeable:  <br>- Many bug fixes, plus performance and stability improvements. ",
        "comments": [
            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

I give it 10 * all the way around!",
            "Can't find my canon mg5760 which is supposed to be compatible so what's the point of this app? I can print from my pc on the same network, my router finds the printer so it's definitely this app that's broken. Canon you had one job and failed at it.",
            "I recently bought a pixma photo printer, and cannot set it up for the life of me. I work in technology and am extremely competent, but I cannot get my printer to connect. The guide online is not an accurate reflection of the app. When searching for a printer, it searches without giving me any additional options, and always says the printer is not found. It might be a good app, but i can't use it!",
            "I attempted to install the app on my laptop but after fiddling around with it for half an hour I changed tactics and installed the app on my phone. Up and running within 2 minutes",
            "I didnt know how to make it work for some time, but my confusion was not the fault of the app. I attempted to make it wok using a very old archos tablet. Was then amazed at its performance with a very old but stylish sony tablet, then, obliged at last to buy an iPhone, discovered that it works perfectly with this app, without my help at all. Dont know why. But very happy with that."

        "description": "Low blood pressure ranges are much more difficult to quantify even if the current guidelines state that the normal range is 120/80. However, some health care experts identify low blood pressure ranges as values that are way lower than ninety systolic pressure and sixty diastolic pressure. Similarly, a blood pressure reading that has one lower number either in systolic or diastolic pressure can be considered as low blood pressure. Even if the systolic pressure is 120 (normal) but the diastolic pressure is fifty, this can be considered as hypo tension.\r\n\r\nDetecting the symptom is difficult until it is too late. But most of the time, common signs include light headedness, dizziness, and fainting. The lowest category of hypo tension is when the pressure significantly drops to a much lower level that is way below the normal range. A systolic pressure that is below sixty coupled with a diastolic pressure of below forty is a very low blood pressure which can expose the person to various risks associated with chronic hypo tension. Dangerous low ranges have readings of 50/33 and this is common to those suffering from atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, kidney problems and other related illnesses. A sudden drop in blood pressure can be very dangerous. A sudden change of 20 systolic pressure from 130 to 110 can result to fainting and dizziness. This happens because the brain is not able to get enough supply of oxygen and other nutrients usually carried by the blood. When this happens other related ailments may occur such as stroke, hardening of arteries, and visual damage among others.\r\n\r\nCauses Of Low Blood Pressure\r\n\r\nThe sudden drop of pressure ranges from the chart can be attributed to a lot of factors. For example, your level can significantly drop due to shock. Severe dehydration often results to hypovolemic shock which is also a life threatening condition. Other types of shock that cause the blood pressure to drop is anaphylaxis. This is an allergic reaction due to insect bites, food allergies, and a septic shock when an infection is integrated with your blood stream.\r\n\r\nMedications can also drop the level of your pressure. Drugs used for treating high blood pressure (diuretics) can cause your blood to lose pressure. According to the American Heart Association, majority of heart medications like antidepressants and beta blockers as well as the drugs used for treating Parkinson's can significantly drop the levels of blood pressure. Using narcotics and overconsumption of alcohol can also drop it as well as other over the counter drugs that can interact with hypertension medications. You can also suffer because of other underlying conditions such as low blood sugar, thyroid problems, and heart failure. Pulmonary embolism and Addison's disease can also result to a lower blood pressure level.\r\n\r\nRisk Factor And Complications\r\n\r\nHypo tension or can easily happen to anyone although there are several types of hypo tension that are common based on your age and other relevant factors. For example, the drop in blood pressure when standing suddenly or after eating a meal usually happens to adults with ages sixty five and above. The drop in blood pressure when suddenly standing up is known as orthostatic hypo tension. The drop that occurs after eating a meal is also known as postprandial hypo tension. Neurally mediated hypo tension on the other hand occurs due to the miscommunication between the heart and the brain. This type of hypo tension is more common among younger adults and children. Even the moderate types of hypo tension or low pressure can not only cause light headedness and dizziness but also fainting. Chronic low blood pressure from any cause of hypo tension can deprive your system with ample amounts of oxygen that will impede it from performing its normal functions. This can lead to brain or heart damage which further increases the risk for fatality.\r\n\r\nDownload the app to know more Remedies for Low Blood Pressure..",

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Forced ads. Everytime I go to play a mission I get forced to watch a 30 second ad. I learned that its faster to just close the game and try again, and hope I dont get another ad. And none of the ads are skippable. I once replayed a level and got an ad while I was getting shot at. The game did not pause while the ad played.",
            "I played this game once in 2019. I unlocked many classes like sapper ,marauder. Now I reinstalled it but I can't retrieve the data from the previous attempt. I logged in with the Google play account today but can't load the previous progress , I also checked the Google play account it still shows I made some 14 achievements.",
            "Gameloft should be shivering with embarrassement at this failure of a game and someone needs to be fired. The disrepect they show to the players is unreal. The game is overrun with cheaters who stand outside the maps and kill everyone. Turrets still fire through walls. Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",
            "I Installed this game after around 1 year, i thought this game is not p2w anymore but i was wrong this game is still filled heavily with p2w stuff, matchmaking system sucks, take my advice go ahead for call of duty mobile, there is no mean to play greedy gameloft's games where activision is giving you console like f2p games Really disappointed of gameloft",
            "The graphics are fairly good, and so as the story line but there is a major issue that is server. I could barely play a complete match before it says network lost even when I have Wifi router connection. I don't think it's network issue may be it's your server issues..."

However I like how after u pay for the songs with ur coins u dont have to pay again, but u have to watch adverts if u want to play ur bought songs, which i dont like😤. But its good👍🏾",

            "I used to enjoy the app, and was getting pretty good with my skill level, then out of nowhere the app started acting glitchy and periodically freezing up right in the middle of a song, and the notes became unresponsive to the touch, and would score you as though your timing was off and you missed them as they came in line with the keys and the intended time to strike or tap them. It's extremely frustrating to be scored so low when it's not a low skill set, but a buggy app causing it. Please fix",

            "I've used aldiko for years, but will now be looking for a different app. Stupid ads make it unusable. When you open the app, it now opens to an ad that won't go away. There's no way to go back or X out of it, it's just stuck there. It's a shame. What once was a good solid app is now garbage..",
            "I've had aldico premium for years and loved it. Recently I moved hundreds of ebooks to the SD card on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and now I cannot get the aldiko reader to open any of those books. I've spent hours on the internet trying to find how and I'll have to change readers if you can't resolve this for me. Thank you. Blue",
            "Come on guys. Love the app, but all the adds recently. Mostly the ones that pop up when the app starts and won't let me pass, making the app unusable. No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",
            "Tried creating a note. It took me to the subscription screen, but there is no alternative pricing. Only monthly. Forget it."

            "Latest Update trashed everything. please fix. Latest update has ruined all downloads. For now everyone AFFECTED by this BUG should go and clear the storage under you apps section. I'm on a Google Pixel 3 Android 11",
            "I am learning to play the guitar and so I need an app like this to help me record backing drum tracks for my practicing. I like the fact that you can see the parts and PLAY THEM and actually listen to the different sounds of the drum set...GREAT. What the app does not offer me, is the chance to place those sounds in a certain order, combine sounds and record the sequence and actually be able to use it as a backing track for your guitar learning. As it is, I see no practical use for it.",
            "I like the overall sound and smooth running of the app. I think it could be much better if you added more features such as being able to move around the pieces to arrange the kit in a way I like, an option to lock the bass drum with a cymbal so every time I hit the cymbal it also hits the bass drum automatically, add a choke to the cymbal, maybe individually adjust each kit piece's volume, and perhaps more options for different sounds (maybe a china, a third crash, a different ride/bell).",
            "I gave it 4 stars because of the delay I'm expiriencing on my tablet. It is fine on my phone and works well but I think it's cause I have an older version on it. I just got my tablet so I'm guessing I have the newest version of it. Please fix the delay and I'll rewrite this with a 5 star rating. The app deserves a 10 star rating when it's working well. It really is a great app. Just that one little🤏 prob. I have faith that it'll bs fixed. Thank you 🙂"

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "It's a great app so far but I have run into a slight issue with renaming songs. It seems like if you rename any songs you have downloaded with apps other than samsung music, it doesn't pick up on it. For example, if I have songnameA and I rename it to songnameB, it shows songnameB in the folder but in the app it doesn't change and is still songnameA. In the recently added section however, it shows songnameB, but as soon as I add it to a playlist it changes back to songnameA.",
            "This really is a good music app. It's simple, clean (mostly), user friendly, and not glitchy. I'd only change 2 things, but they bug me enough to drop rating 1 star each. #1 PLEASE add the option to list multiple, separate, Artists and Genres in 'edit Track Details'?! There is one line to list any & all, but if I add 2(+) names or a 'feat', the track won't show up under each artist, only the 2(+) names together. #2 NEED 'Do Not Show Again' box on irritating SiriusXM ad when app starts up.",
            "I have championed this app along with the very polished Internet and email apps Samsung makes. It is smooth, snappy, has good sound, is simple and light. But... Ads... They bothered me for a while, but I'm just learning to suck it up and deal with it. It's a couple of clicks every now and again. It's still the best in terms of functionality playing my local files. I like it's dark theme and generally feels intuitive. One star off because it would still be better without ads.",
            "As of the last three updates this app has been the bug central. The worst of any music apps I've used. The welcome ads; freezing before playing a song; long pauses before deleting a playlist or removing a song from a playlist. What gives? It was never like this before. I wish there was an option to reset it to factory settings. I'll be looking for a new app today.",
            "I had to move to this app because Google play shut down & YouTube music is garbage. It's alright. I can add music to some magical queue but somehow cannot look to see what's in said queue. It's good to make playlists & listen to music on random. However, unlike google play, when I put all my music on random I cant see a queue so I have no clue what's next, cant change my queue, and I dont like that. Unlike google play I cant swipe to the next song, I have to hit next, so in the car is not good."

And says outlandish number of seconds until the game starts like 2868 seconds until the game starts and then all sudden I'm starting to game and then it kicks me out when there is 20 bingos left and says game over and then kicked me out saying that there's a data error",
            "*Update: 10-7-20 I haven't played for a while and I have no clue how to turn on Epic or whatever, but I also just lost 60 tickets! I bought 1 card in Candy Crush and accidentally hit the back button, even before the game had started and went straight back in and it took my tickets and didn't even give me my card!! Smh! * Love the game but there's only like 18 bingos per 180 cards. Need more bingos and I'll give u 5 stars! It's no fun when u rarely win a bingo!",
            "Great, fun game; BUT do not be fooled, this company is out to rip you off. The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things. I understand charging for lots of extras, but then your money doesn't even go anywhere.. these are fake items on a phone ppl are purchasing.",
            "How about fixing your technical issues! Have not been able to send and receive gifts for a week! Cannot open new locations, too! Fix it!!!! Still not fixed; can't even open Tasks now. You suck! I have logged in and out of FB numerous times, still not fixed! I uninstalled and re-installed this game 3 times; still cannot open gift box, today's Tasks , and now the icon has disappeared where you can do the daily and royal challenge, WTH!!!!! You need to fix your ridiculous technical issues!!!#",

            "I was working perfectly until yesterday. I opened it this morning to send some stuff but the message still isn't delivered. It doesn't work on both devices i used it on. I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

            "Have used this app successfully for several years on multiple devices. However, it has now stopped working completely following an upgrade to Android 10 - as other reviewers have reported. App appears to install correctly and allows you to lock individual apps so they require PIN/ pattern to run them. Once you've configured the app, it simply doesn't work - you can open any app on the phone without your PIN. I've tried a uninstall/ reinstall but that didn't work either. Uninstalled permanently and replaced with rival app.",
            "Kudos to AppLock Developers, I have been using the app for over 5years and currently on my Android 10 and it's doing just fine. People that complain it doesn't work needs to confirm if in their memory (RAM) cleaning, the app is white listed and also allow the app complete access to the phone e.g access to modify files, access to camera, access to notifications etc. The only problem I encountered is the phone cleaner within the app it's cleans important files, Thanks",
            "Keeps saying my SD storage is full but all the files I try and add into the vault are in the SD card that still has 98GB worth of free data. Looking at it again it drags it off my SD card and into my internal storage clogging up my phone. Uninstalling the app keeps all those files locked up forcing me to reinstall the app after I delete one of my other apps. Too much of a pain in the ass to work with to be installed.",
            "Apparently no longer get any support. and I have been a VIP also known as premium subscriber for several years. Have been trying for weeks now to get support at the listed email site. The app will not recognize that I am a paid member and all my configurations disappeared when the app updated itself. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to see if I could get my configured settings back. All I get by email is just an automated response to check the FAQ.",
            "I've been using this app for more than 5 years now and it's exceptional. But I just downloaded it now on my newly bought phone (Redmi Note 9S Global) and it's no longer working in terms of locking system apps (Gallery, Photos, File Manager, Messenger, etc). I locked those apps to require a password everytime it will be opened, but sad to say it's opening right away even if I set it to be locked. It sucks to say that this app now sucks big time. Please fix it ASAP."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

Also, if the developers can make a notification pop up whenever I go to any store or mall to remind me to pay via Samsung Pay. Example: I go into a Bath & Body Works store, the app will give me a notification pop up saying, \"Remember to pay at checkout using Samsung Pay!\"",
            "With a samsung phone the integration of samsung pay is very convenient. The fact the app can be pulled while the screen is off is great for making checkout easier. While GPay can be just as convenient, some machines don't read GPay as well for some reason. Have not had any problems since using it.",

And when I change the font, the doc has to be refreshed in order for it to reflect the new font. Much inconvenience.",

Can you make it so of your writing a story to have the option to have book pages that you can adjust the size cuz im writing a story and i wud LOVE that option. Also not just for storys but for essays and stuff. Would be great for printing 2 so you know size of page. Also have spelling corrections. Thanks google!!",

            "I've been on and off with this app for years. It's had so many changes throughout the years but this latest version has got to be the worst. The latest interface is just clunky. The old one was better. Another thing: there was two versions of this app. The original version was this free one. Now it's not free anymore? How is it that you guys are putting a premium on this one when you already made another pro version that you had to pay for? Just keep this one separate and free.",
            "Wow... just wow. Downloaded app a while back, and was pretty good! Unlocked all the fx options by watching videos, and was able to actually use the app.new update comes in, cant do anything but watch ads. Now even the previously free fx effects are now \"premium\", and whenever you click the fx tab, it brings up the subscription page, interrupting your doing. And when you exit THAT add, ANOTHER one comes up! Worst update ever.",
            "This pirch bar is a joke, can barely set the bpm right without using the sync button. You ruined it, the previous one was way better. It's nice that you can apply 2 effects on a track at the same time unlike before the update, but now they're smaller which makes it harder to use with my chunky fingers, i often screw it up because of that. The eq slides were narrowed down, bad idea. The automix button just simply shouldn't exist or place it somewhere else where you can't press it by accident.",
            "Don't even bother updating it, when you try to change the tempo/pitch of the song, its too hard to get it accurately to where you want it to be using the bar, the way it was before was way better and the worst part is they charge you for recording, they'll do everything and anything for money....",
            "I absolutely love love love this app great for beginner djs or just to have fun my only problem is that I cannot record anything I mix through SoundCloud even if I do buy premium. if there is a fix for this I would love to hear about it also would like to see more personalization opinions when you do pay for it"

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

Pls fix this. :) And if I can give the developer 1 suggestion, it will be customizable snare, drum, crash location. by the way, Iam using Samsung galaxy s9+",

            "Honestly, I've played this game before, so I got it again, only to be disappointed. Whenever I create (or try to) my viking, it stops at the name and says there is a problem registering my viking. Other people are having this issue, but I will keep the game and see if it's resolved soon. Jumpstart Games, fix your game, please.",
            "It's overall a good game that I can spend my time on, but there are a lot of issues that makes many people frustrated. The infamous Battle Event glitch keeps appearing and it sucks. Also, stop changing the Battle Event rewards for the events. I just want to farm gems without engaging in the event, but it forces me to get candy instead. Events should be, well, an event that gives players an option to engage in it or not. Thawfest was the reason why I kept the game uninstalled for months.",
            "It has been awesome playing this game and I love it !!!!!!! I'm glad that you fixed the wild dragon disappearing thing !! But .....I can't do like ....anything ! Cuz you have to pay money for gems and you can't do anything if you don't have gems ! I'd love it if you made there be less coin spending on the new quests and stuff like that !! Please do !!",
            "This game is great.... except that the chat system is awful (the chat is a tad bit too censored and you could get banned for a simple mistake, even though they don't even tell what you said wrong, they just tell you that you said something wrong), the graphics aren't the best, but not the worst, and the controls (especially for decorating the farm) are kinda terrible. But, I suppose it is somewhat decent if you look past the issues. Also, the teen dragons are very glitchy and broken.",
            "It's a fun game overall, but it's also a Pay-to-Win game. You either have to spend money on memberships or gems to do any of the fun quest, or grind for months. I have a membership account and it gets boring because theres no quests until a big update. You should add daily quest to level up your dragons, or just to do something fun. And I also get constantly get \"Logged Out\" of the game. Please fix that. And the chat is horrible. I can't say Hi or I get muted. But overall, it's a decent game."

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

But this has made me think of uninstalling the app. Hope you fix it as early as possible. It is having a bug in android 10. It is still running good in android 9. Please fix this bug for android 10",
            "I love this app i used to play it alot but now I've switched to my new phone and it doesn't work, Whenever i launch it, it shows me the tutorial window and then it shows a hand pointing at the pads, when it points to the second pad the app crashes and instantly kicks me off. If you fix this i will rate 5 stars edit: you fixed it 😁👍 Thank you",
            "The app is now broken. I can only hear the music out of one ear. And I know it's not my headphones, because I tried different games and they worked fine. Edit: ok thank you guys for working so hard on this app to give us the best possible experience!",

The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",

            "This is a horrendous app!! Won't allow you to even play, without paying 70 for a 1 year subscription. There is no way to exit, no X or option to use limited features. Total scam. Don't waste your time. Developers, you need to fix this issue!! Or delete the app!! Calling you out...",
            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"
