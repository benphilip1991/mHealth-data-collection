            "I have moderate asthma. This app is very helpful because now know how many puffs I've got left. My problem is I now have to manually add the dose if I press the + button it won't do anything.",
            "Looks like it would be a good app if all the important features weren't locked behind an upgrade... which there's no way to do via app OR Play Store.",
            "The issue hasn't been fixed I cannot add my main medication as when I click save it takes me to main medication page and it doesn't show. I tried to resolve it by sending message but when I come to check it today that's broken to. The app is complete disaster when it supposed to be help tool for people with asthma. They're also selling some ad on to classic asthma pumps which is why I suggest Google removes this app before someone falls for this scam.",
            "A bit hard to add inhalers, a bit counterintuitive. I have the same inhaler for treatment and rescue. However, I am not able to add it as both - the app automatically switches the inhaler to the other category. Might be impossible to follow up with my doses in this case (not sure if I can add more doses to my regular medication than what I set up). I like that it has air quality, weather and pollen in the same place, as I am affected by all these and have had to use separate apps."

            "Not keen on the cheesy wording of the reminders, and the device swivels in my phone port, so blowing into it feels like it might not be accurate. Useful to have a log of readings, though, and it's more precise than the peak flow meter supplied by my GP. I paid for the device at the end of the free trial, and I'm almost convinced it was worth it.",
            "New to the product and app, but seems easy to use. Had trouble with the device plugged directly into my phone, but works fine via Bluetooth. Much smaller than the standard peak flow meter which is a massive bonus. Hopefully I'll start taking regular readings now which I never used to do with the manual device. Whether it helps with my Asthma remains to be seen.",
            "For the modern asthmatic, this app is good. It records your peak-flows, grades them and let's you look at some basic stats. It also records your daily symptoms and logs reliever uses. The advice it gives is generic though. Export to CSV is nice. Setup for the Bluetooth was a little tricky as it didn't want to communicate at first. The beta \"AI Prediction\" is a waste of time at the moment. Best it could say after 11 days was \"90% chance I'll be in either of the 2 zones I've always been in.",
            "Newly diagnosed asthmatic so much easier to use than bigger peak flow meter and paper chart. The daily reminders are great too so I don't forget to take my preventer each day too. Would definitely recommend as when Dr asks how my asthma is I can quickly show them my chart on my phone which most of us carry all the time....! It takes a few minutes to connect and use but it really is so convenient and easy to pack and take away.",
            "I've only just started using it but have found it easy to use. My asthma nurse is interested to see how this could help other patients monitor their asthma and has asked me to send her my chart in the next couple of months. She had never heard of the device, for me I wanted something that would be easy to use and hassle free."

        "description": "Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise. \r\nAsthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivityreaction. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Asthma symptoms, Asthma management, Asthma causes, Asthma diagnosis, Asthma Prognosis, Asthma Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Asthma Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivityreaction. <br>==========================<br>APP FEATURES<br>==========================<br>This exclusive app will help to understand the Asthma symptoms, Asthma management, Asthma causes, Asthma diagnosis, Asthma Prognosis, Asthma Epidemiology and history. <br>Here are features that make this app better than all other Asthma Disease apps - <br>-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. <br>-\tEasily Change the page.<br>-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.<br>-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.<br>-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.<br><br>All these features are available for free. <br><br>==========================<br>SAY HELLO<br>==========================<br>Any medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "asthma medications  app is book & referensce Overall, the goal of medical treatment is to control asthmatic symptoms as well as prevent any possible future. When you have asthma, you need to be under the care of a doctor who can track the various changes of the disease, your reaction to medications and treat accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nsigns of asthma\r\nasthma medications\r\nasthma\r\nasthma symptoms\r\nasthma treatment\r\ninhaler\r\nasthma inhalers\r\nasthma action plan\r\nasthma attack\r\nunderstanding of asthma attacks\r\nasthma attack understanding\r\nthe value of asthma attack and bronchial asthma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about asthma medications: \r\n\r\nWhat Causes Asthma?\r\n\r\nIt has been determined that asthma now affects one out of 15 children in North America and is the most common chronic illness among young ones. This affliction is the result of chronic inflammation of bronchial tubes in the lungs. When these tubes become sensitive to certain allergens or irritants, they overreact and swell. When exposed to these irritants, the inflammation of these tubes will eventually constrict breathing.\r\n\r\nThere are several causes for this illness. Besides allergies, asthma can be stress-related, weight-related or job-related. Higher stress levels in the body tend to change the immune system and cause more inflammation of the air passage. Obesity is another contributor to this painful medical issue. Certain occupations with poor air quality have also been linked to this problem.\r\n\r\nCommon Symptoms \r\nThere are several common symptoms that indicate a person has this disease but it can vary from person to person. They are shortness of breath, wheezing with a whistling or hissing sound when breathing, coughing, and tightness of the chest. They tend to show themselves with excessive exercise, cold air, or at night time.\r\n\r\nThe Goal Of Asthma Treatment \r\nIn terms of diagnosis, the number one problem of this illness is that it resembles many other respiratory and heart conditions. There are many prevalent medicines that are commonly administered in this case. But, medications always show a better result when given on a case to case basis.\r\n\r\nAfter a physical exam to find the severity of the attacks and a medical history to list possible triggers, the doctor will plan a long-term treatment of medications to take on a daily basis. Medications must be closely supervised by your doctor. So tell your doctor about any good reactions or bad side effects as soon as it happens.\r\n\r\nTypes Of Asthma Medications \r\nMedications used for treatment are bronchodilators, which relax the bronchial spasms, and corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation.

        "descriptionHTML": "asthma medications  app is book &amp; referensce Overall, the goal of medical treatment is to control asthmatic symptoms as well as prevent any possible future. When you have asthma, you need to be under the care of a doctor who can track the various changes of the disease, your reaction to medications and treat accordingly.<br><br><br>In this app we will discuss:<br><br>signs of asthma<br>asthma medications<br>asthma<br>asthma symptoms<br>asthma treatment<br>inhaler<br>asthma inhalers<br>asthma action plan<br>asthma attack<br>understanding of asthma attacks<br>asthma attack understanding<br>the value of asthma attack and bronchial asthma<br><br><br><br>feature on the app<br><br>_ update once a week<br>_ useful tips that you will provide<br>_ a very simple look in the app.<br><br>little explanation about asthma medications: <br><br>What Causes Asthma?<br><br>It has been determined that asthma now affects one out of 15 children in North America and is the most common chronic illness among young ones. This affliction is the result of chronic inflammation of bronchial tubes in the lungs. When these tubes become sensitive to certain allergens or irritants, they overreact and swell. When exposed to these irritants, the inflammation of these tubes will eventually constrict breathing.<br><br>There are several causes for this illness. Besides allergies, asthma can be stress-related, weight-related or job-related. Higher stress levels in the body tend to change the immune system and cause more inflammation of the air passage. Obesity is another contributor to this painful medical issue. Certain occupations with poor air quality have also been linked to this problem.<br><br>Common Symptoms <br>There are several common symptoms that indicate a person has this disease but it can vary from person to person. They are shortness of breath, wheezing with a whistling or hissing sound when breathing, coughing, and tightness of the chest. They tend to show themselves with excessive exercise, cold air, or at night time.<br><br>The Goal Of Asthma Treatment <br>In terms of diagnosis, the number one problem of this illness is that it resembles many other respiratory and heart conditions. There are many prevalent medicines that are commonly administered in this case. But, medications always show a better result when given on a case to case basis.<br><br>After a physical exam to find the severity of the attacks and a medical history to list possible triggers, the doctor will plan a long-term treatment of medications to take on a daily basis. Medications must be closely supervised by your doctor. So tell your doctor about any good reactions or bad side effects as soon as it happens.<br><br>Types Of Asthma Medications <br>Medications used for treatment are bronchodilators, which relax the bronchial spasms, and corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation. Inhaled medications are preferred as they immediately are breathed into the affected area. These produce less side effects than oral medications of tablet or liquid medicines. Medications must be closely supervised by your doctor. So tell your doctor about any good reactions or bad side effects as soon as it happens.<br><br>Possible Side Effects <br>There are hundreds of drugs related to treating this disease that are being dispersed every day.

This Free App provides 20 and more different Natural Alternative Therapies for Asthma Attack. When it comes to understanding all of the new asthma treatments available, it's natural to feel a little confused.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is that asthma is a \"variable\" disease. In other words, the symptoms can vary from person to person, and even the same person's condition may fluctuate throughout the year.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, people have become more aware of complementary therapies and their use for treating various medical conditions, such as asthma. There are many reasons why some people choose to use complementary therapies. For example, they:\r\nmay want to reduce the amount of medicines or inhalers they use \r\nmay prefer to use a “natural” alternative \r\nmay be disillusioned with the approach of Western medicine\r\nhave heard from others that a particular complementary therapy works well for their condition\r\nfeel that using complementary therapies gives them more control over their treatment. \r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your asthma, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. \r\nIt is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nWhat allergies trigger Asthma, or asthma related cough.. What are the Asthma treatment guidelines?\r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to relieve asthma is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their Asthma Attack  with alternative techniques.\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments.  This app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your asthma problems and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself. However one may need Medical or Expert advice for certain protocols.

There are many reasons why some people choose to use complementary therapies. For example, they:<br>may want to reduce the amount of medicines or inhalers they use <br>may prefer to use a “natural” alternative <br>may be disillusioned with the approach of Western medicine<br>have heard from others that a particular complementary therapy works well for their condition<br>feel that using complementary therapies gives them more control over their treatment. <br>If you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your asthma, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. <br>It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. <br><br>What allergies trigger Asthma, or asthma related cough.. What are the Asthma treatment guidelines?<br><br>There are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to relieve asthma is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine.

These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their Asthma Attack  with alternative techniques.<br>There are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being.

This does not just feel unnatural, it can even cause you to adopt an unhealthy way of breathing, which can lead to health issues. Beware, even some of the most downloaded apps make this mistake!\r\nBreath Ball's breathing is based on clinical observations of hundreds of humans. The app was specifically designed for clinical environments. That's why Breath Balls breathing exercises feel natural and work much better than any of the competing apps.\r\n⭐️ No quackery: Breath Ball is based on sound scientific research. New breathing exercises are added only when there is sufficient research data available.\r\nHowever, you can of course define your own breathing exercises and use Breath Ball for whatever you want.\r\n⭐️ Maximum customizability: Our well being highly depends on what we like and dislike. Breath Ball is the only app you can fully customize to your liking: Colors, breathing exercises and even the size of the user interface can be adjusted to give you the breathing app that feels just right for you.\r\n⭐️ Focus on simplicity: Breath Ball is incredibly easy to use and even the first breathing session usually leads to great results.\r\n⭐️ Free: Even the free version of Breath Ball provides all the functionality you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThese are the main reasons why leading medical professionals, therapists and biofeedback coaches use and recommend Breath Ball.\r\n\r\nWhat is Breath Ball used for?\r\nBreath Ball helps you to relieve stress and anxiety, soothe the symptoms of COPD and Asthma, lower high blood pressure and overcome sleeplessness with four easy breathing exercises. What might sound too simple to be true, is actually based on latest scientific research and is used to treat patients at rehab facilities and in clinical environments. So let's take a closer look at Breath Ball's breathing exercises and what they can do for you:\r\n\r\nBreath Ball provides breathing exercises for these four use cases:\r\n\r\n⭐️ The cardiac coherence breathing exercise is used to relieve stress and anxiety. It is thought to patients at rehab and bio-feedback trainings to help them get calm and relax.\r\n\r\n⭐️ The COPD foundation’s recommended breathing technique helps to relieve the\r\nsymptoms of Asthma and COPD.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Slow paced breathing is a complementary treatment against hypertension (high blood pressure). It goes back to Prof. Dr. Loew and is commonly used in clinical environments.\r\n\r\n⭐️ Dr. Andrew Weil’s famous 4:7:8 breathing technique is used to get calm to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nEach of these breathing exercises comes with a short tutorial that will get you started in less than two minutes. Beside that you can create your own breathing exercises; something yoga and pranayama coaches enjoy a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy concerns?\r\nPlease note: We truly value your privacy.

            "It's a great app even before going pro (which in my case is not needed. I try to use it once a day just to help me control my breath while meditating. Strongly recommended.",
            "I like this app a lot but it's not fully developed. I would not invest in the premium version yet as the free version has plenty of glitches. I find it helpful and I think it has a great Foundation to be a frontrunner. I specifically like the breathing bar although only comes with premium. I like being able to change the colors making it easier on my eyes and less stressful to use. I also like the defined breathing exercises for Sleep stress COPD excetera. But the app needs work.",
            "Awesome customisable app,only thing missing is dark mode and import own background sounds in case one doesn't like the ones there/for variety.Maybe the white screen should have some pastel colours with shades changing as the ball moves? Upon completion of a longer time maybe an encouraging message like \"well done or you've improved \" to encourage people to return to the app? So good I recommended it to a friend who enjoys it :D thank you so much makers of this app !!😊 No account needed,yay !",
            "This app has potential, but presently has annoying glitches: 1) has several audible glitches in the audio (inhale and exhale cues), 2) no delayed start is available, 3) always asks confirmation before exiting (it should not do this unkess you are in the middle of a session. It should also provide the option to turn this confirmation off.)",
            "Visual of ball and adjustment of timing is great. But the audio glitches that make a crackling sound every time the audio cue happens makes this app unusable with the sound on. Yes, you can just turn the audio guide off, but the audio guide, without the glitches, would really add to the meditative experience and would allow you to not have to be looking at the ball 100% of the time."

            "I love the app, but I can't figure out how to sustain for more than 99 seconds. Maybe someone could take a breather and tell me. I'm sorry for not being more clear in my review. I'm trying to edit \"Tummo\" to do the \"Wim Hoff\" method. When I go to \"ratio of breath cycle\", it only goes up to 99 seconds. How do I make it go longer? I think it has something to do with \"seconds per ratio unit\" but I'm sort of confused. I was good at math in college, but that was over 50 years ago. Things are getting more discombobulated with age.",
            "All i needed to commit to a regular breathing practice is right here within this app. The wiki has been a very valuable resource to learn about breath work, how to practice, as well as the form and function of the app. I literally love this app and use it every day. It has certainly been one of the keys to help me create personal transform.",
            "I love this app and the paid version is so worth having. Breathwork is increasingly important in my self-care routine and I've just reincorporated this app into it, and I'm so glad I did. A little bit tricky to twiddle with if you're setting up custom breathing patterns but that's because you need to think about them mathematically, so not an issue with the app at all!",
            "Dear Oleksandr, there should be a way to hear the phase transition only once, instead of twice when it alternates between exhale and inhale. ie. I am inhaling for 5 seconds and 5 seconds exhale. I only want to hear phase transition once, after every 10 seconds, instead of every 5 seconds. there is no way to do this currently since exhale or inhale cannot be set to 0, but retain and sustain can be set to 0. When I am listening to this for hours in the background, less noise helps. Thanks.",
            "It is the best app out there. I have never written a recommendation before, but this app deserves it. I have trouble counting the seconds of my breathing while doing it and this app has sound effects so even with closed eyes you know when to inhale, hold, exhale. It has different techniques and I also customised to my way in the free version. It is really the best. Can't recommend it enough. Just download it!"

            "I love the app, but I can't figure out how to sustain for more than 99 seconds. Maybe someone could take a breather and tell me. I'm sorry for not being more clear in my review. I'm trying to edit \"Tummo\" to do the \"Wim Hoff\" method. When I go to \"ratio of breath cycle\", it only goes up to 99 seconds. How do I make it go longer? I think it has something to do with \"seconds per ratio unit\" but I'm sort of confused. I was good at math in college, but that was over 50 years ago. Things are getting more discombobulated with age.",
            "All i needed to commit to a regular breathing practice is right here within this app. The wiki has been a very valuable resource to learn about breath work, how to practice, as well as the form and function of the app. I literally love this app and use it every day. It has certainly been one of the keys to help me create personal transform.",
            "I love this app and the paid version is so worth having. Breathwork is increasingly important in my self-care routine and I've just reincorporated this app into it, and I'm so glad I did. A little bit tricky to twiddle with if you're setting up custom breathing patterns but that's because you need to think about them mathematically, so not an issue with the app at all!",
            "Dear Oleksandr, there should be a way to hear the phase transition only once, instead of twice when it alternates between exhale and inhale. ie. I am inhaling for 5 seconds and 5 seconds exhale. I only want to hear phase transition once, after every 10 seconds, instead of every 5 seconds. there is no way to do this currently since exhale or inhale cannot be set to 0, but retain and sustain can be set to 0. When I am listening to this for hours in the background, less noise helps. Thanks.",
            "It is the best app out there. I have never written a recommendation before, but this app deserves it. I have trouble counting the seconds of my breathing while doing it and this app has sound effects so even with closed eyes you know when to inhale, hold, exhale. It has different techniques and I also customised to my way in the free version. It is really the best. Can't recommend it enough. Just download it!"

Several different types of asthma have different triggers.\r\n\r\n- Allergic asthma is when the symptoms are triggered by allergens that the sufferer comes into contact with. Some of the most common triggers in allergic asthma are dust, pollen, pet dander, etc. An avoidance or reduced exposure to these triggers can help substantially. Most children who are diagnosed with asthma suffer from allergic asthma. Smoking during pregnancy and while children are young can make them more vulnerable to allergic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Exercise-induced asthma is when your asthma symptoms only occur during strenuous exercise. This asthma is due to the fact that the lungs lose their moisture and heat during times of strenuous activity. Coughing is the most common symptom observed with this type of asthma, although there may be more severe symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Intrinsic asthma is when the symptoms are not linked to a particular allergy. Some of the triggers in intrinsic asthma are perfume, smoke and cold air, cleaning fumes, an upper respiratory infection, and GERD or gastroesophageal reflux. Patients who begin having allergy symptoms after the age of 40 most often suffer from intrinsic asthma.\r\n\r\n- Occupational asthma occurs when you begin having asthma symptoms due to being in contact with dust, fumes, chemicals, or other irritants over a long period of time at work. This makes working very difficult. You may want to change your working environment for the sake of your health.\r\n\r\n- Nocturnal asthma occurs when you suffer from allergy symptoms while sleeping. It can be triggered by bedding allergens or other allergens located in your bedroom, GERD, or a decrease in the temperature of the bedroom.\r\n\r\nIt is important that you learn more about your cause of asthma to determine how best to control or avoid your triggers. It is possible to lead a more normal life, free of the many miserable allergy symptoms, if you learn how to best take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nDownload causes of asthma app for learn more information.",

Except for the 'S' size widget, all the widgets are unreadable because the weather info writing overlaps with the pollution info. It's clearly a re-sizing problem. The XL size shrinks to an L on the screen and cannot be altered. Same with all other sizes. Removing weather data would resolve this or re-sizing them would also resolve it. Thanks.",

I'm sitting here and noticed it hadn't updated in an hour. Hit refresh on the widget. Still says it hasn't updated in an hour. Opened the app/refreshed. Same. Opened another AQI app and it spiked up! Not green! Bad app!",
            "Great app. I have been looking for something like this for a while. Found nothing else which would give you daily, monthly comparison to see how the quality has improved or deteriorated over the past. The prediction feature for the next days helps plan ahead of time",
            "This is an excellent app. Does everything well. Important updates that the developer should make are - 1. Make the widget smaller than 5*2, it occupies too much space 2. Have it integrated with the notification panel so AQI can be reached everyone notifications are accessed."

WCA has been very popular, resulting in highly successful & well attended congresses with outstanding scientific programs. The 24th World Congress of Asthma – WCA-2018 will not be an exception.\r\n\r\nINTERASMA is celebrating its 62nd anniversary of uninterrupted education in the field of asthma, making it the most important international asthma and related diseases organization in the world, as well as a reference organization for primary care physicians, healthcare providers and medical students.\r\n\r\nTokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital city of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and governed as a “metropolitan prefecture”, which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.\r\n\r\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country’s largest museum specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\r\n\r\nTokyo has many theatres for performing arts. These include national and private theatres for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre and the Kabuki-za for kabuki. Symphony orchestras and other musical organisations perform modern and traditional music. Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known arenas such as the Nippon Budokan.\r\n\r\nIt is our pleasure to welcome you to Tokyo, Japan, on October 2018.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nProfessor Lawrence DuBuske\r\nPresident  of GAA Interasma\r\n\r\nProfessor Ken Ohta\r\nPresident of the Local Organizing Committee",

Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "This really helps me, especially the deep calm breathing pattern. Fantastic if you are looking at the screen because it paces you when the inhale, hold and exhale have a different length (4,7,8) The vibrate on step change is also super useful if you can't look at the screen. The only thing I'd really love is a better visualization for when you are holding your breath, but that's a pretty minor quibble. It's great. Try it.",
            "I want to thank the developers for making such a great app. In the current scenario where everyone is making an app that's meant more for gaining profits than making impact on people's lives, this app is meant for the well being of people. Thanks for keeping it add free. Recommended to each and everyone who's thinking of looking after their mental health.",
            "I love the simplicity! And I am thrilled to see the custom timed setting! I like to inhale for 5 seconds through my nose, hold for 5 seconds, and fully exhale for 15 seconds through my mouth, then pause for 2 seconds, and repeat! I can do that with this app perfectly for my specific lung capacity. Thank you so much for this simple 'does exactly what it claims to do' app. It's a real ... breath of fresh air! :)",
            "Hi, I really like the app! I don't think I will continue to use it as I need something where I can change pattern in the middle of a session, but if I didn't need this it'd be great. I prefer to change on the fly, but if enough people wanted it maybe consider adding something where, when setting up the pattern in advance, you can set multiple sets of patterns with a duration for each? Would also love to pick colors, and more sounds. But honestly this really is a lovely app, thank you!!",
            "Really liked it! Simple and just perfect app for breathing exercises and meditation. However, doing for 7 minutes is not enough. Please provide an option of 10 ,15, 20 ,30 mins too in the settings. And may be a graph for duration and consistency."

        "comments": [
            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD is a progressive disease, meaning it typically worsens over time. Eventually everyday activities, such as walking or getting dressed, become difficult. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD. The term \"chronic bronchitis\" is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years. Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests.  In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.",

            "Much more than I expected. Very intuitive interface for learning quite a bit about the air quality. I've been using this for a month or so and pleased with the functionality, information and format. I'll give it 5 stars when I see an accurate forecast for poor air. So far it's been accurate for current air which of course is only moderately useful. This app leads into an ecosystem of products which they endorse and or make and market themselves. I'm considering buying a node to contribute.",
            "Wow, great air quality index (AQI) app. It's got a nice design, easy user interface, quick to understand and showing all important information in a digestible way. You can also keep track of your pollution exposure. The satellite map modelling pollution distribution is pretty high profile! What needs improvement is that the app should mention which standard is used, PM2.5 or PM10, which is most important. It's hidden in the option \"display main pollutant\".",
            "This app has been amazing when looking at the air quality outdoors in a snap! I would like to see more updates to the widgets, because the little and small widgets don't have a refresh button, so you can manually refresh the air quality number and see if it changed, but this app doesn't have that. Some more widget sizes and different designs would be great as well, but there are five already you can choose from. If you guys add the manual refresh button feature I will change my star rating to 5.",
            "I use this app daily as I live in a city with variable air quality and want to make sure my outside exercise time is spent in decent air. However, the map in the recent update is extremely poor: The +- option for zooming in has been removed which makes it more awkward to use. The map graphics are now terrible. It's hard to determine landmarks and zoom into the correct region of the map. Rivers are almost invisible and the grey background is a bad contrast making it harder to read.",
            "The app has gone downhill since the last Android update. Visual elements are low contrast and difficult to read. City names are tiny. Support is non-existent and ignores user feedback. Also, IQAir is taking Purple Air data but not validating it. During wildfires, it was obvious that indoor locations were being reported as outdoor locations because there was such a difference in their AQI readings vs other outdoor locations. Neither company would QC or clean up the data."

            "I used to really enjoy this app but recently the vibrating function isn't functioning the way it used to. I primarily use the vibrating feature and just have the phone lie next to me. Before it would vibrate once for each action (inhale, hold, exhale) but now it vibrates twice when it's on hold, confusing you to whether it's moving on to the next action or not. I'm not sure if this is due to the new update or not but I hope it can be fixed! Besides that it's great!",
            "overall a good app, but could do with a few tweaks (1) maybe a start timer give a you chance to prepare. (2) a visual general timer to know how far you are in the exercise (3) some way of the knowing that exercise has finished (4) need ad free version (5) off line version, do all these & you'll get 5 stars, keep up the good work",
            "I downloaded this app after reading about the benefits of breathing exercises. This is a well designed app that not only guides you through breathing exercises but provides information about them. Clean and easy layout. Good work.",
            "This app is very simple to use and by doing the exercises every day one can actually feel different. In my personal experience, I have noticed how my stress levels have been reduced and I have been able to cope with my day to day life (now with the COVID 19) in a healthy way. Just by breathing in a certain way one can improve our state of mind. Thank you for the person/s who created this amazing app",

            "Basically just a weather app. None of the different levels of pollen work or show any data. It's basically an app that will show my weather and that's about it. I can log my allergy symptoms for the day but it doesn't show me any of the pollen in my area or the closest major city even.",
            "Edit: it seems to now let me log entries. 🤷🏽‍♀️ -old review- In app I can not log in how I feel. The button is disabled, even after finishing surveys and closing app multiple times. I tried contacting support from both app and play store, each go to different email addresses, and both return an error 550. There's also a bug in not saving profile data and icon if the birthdate is entered in single digits, but no error given.",
            "I'm disappointed because this seems like a great app, but there's no information for pollen count in my area. It would be incredibly useful for me and I'm sad that I got my hopes up for an app that apparently won't help me.",

No, Outstanding work!",
            "Super impressed with all the information, especially because it's so local! Love being able to tie my symptoms over time to what's in the air. I get sinusitis but not usually itchy eyes etc, so it's really helpful to see what sets me off tracking over time.",
            "This app is so great! I used it for a while, deleted it when I thought I was done using it, and now it's back. I use it all the time to see what's high and what is causing my allergies. It's also so nice to see that something is going to be high so I do my best to stay indoors then. I love it!",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Having tried this app out by recording last month's symptoms and calling up the chart, I couldn't export it even though I have a Google address. Then I found that one of the symptoms appeared on today's date, when I haven't had it today. There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",
            "The app ws working great for a few months. I was tracking everything in readiness for an important doctors appointment next week. Woke up this morning to find all my tracking has gone! And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",
            "Can't export data because I can't add an email. Can't fix this because the email address provided on Google Play Store is no longer valid. Very, very disappointed and sad. This app is incredible but without being able to export data, it's 100% useless.",
            "very simple and easy to use for recording symptoms. the reporting leaves something to be desired. I'd like to be able to select one symptoms and then see how all the factors compare for that one symptom instead of selecting then one at a time.",
            "Excellent. Simple, customizable and for the data junky: exportable. I use it to track any environmental variable, moods, sleep, excercise, water etc and of course every outcome: vigor, acuity and the negative of course headaches, etc etc. Along with myfitnesspal it's the only health ap I need."

            "I really like this app when it works, but it's got some bugs that make biofeedback mode unusable sometimes, and that makes me question it's accuracy all of the time. Sometimes when it detects my heart rate, it seems accurate, but sometimes the HR it reports is WAY OFF. Example: it says my HR is fluctuating between 40 and 55 but it's really closer to 80. Simple mode is great.",
            "This is great. Love the ambient sound options, but I would like it much more if I could choose to listen to the beat of my heart instead of the breathing rate. My breathe makes its own sound and the ball can bounce silently. I'd like a simple peaceful sounding heart beat to meditate with or the possibility of listening to both breathe and heartbeat.",
            "It is a great app and premiss, but I got it with the hope of using the heartrate monitor feature in conjunction with the breathing tool, but the flashlight kept burning my finger and so I couldn't use it for more than 30 seconds at time like I'd wanted. If you guys debug that aspect of it, I would defiantly give it a try again.",
            "The problem is that the biofeedback mode is utterly useless because the heart rate measurements via the camera are so unreliable and noisy. Other apps manage to do it perfectly fine so I can only conclude that the developers are either incompetent or just don't care. Either way, a waste of my money.",

        "description": "Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. \r\nCommon allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Allergy symptoms, Allergy management, Allergy causes, Allergy diagnosis, Allergy Prognosis, Allergy Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Allergy Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Oh well, back to 1950's health care for me :(",

Take 4 more for other things. Not sure I see the point at all of doing daily logs anyhow! Now also blocked notifications as fed up with being told to say how I feel. Don't like so many aspects of this app. Also can't link my diabetes blue tooth monitor or my blood pressure blue tooth device.",

I've recently been diagnosed with COPD just before the pandemic so haven't really had any guidance yet so this is really helping me. I've been using the app for a couple of weeks now & am still finding it really useful. I'm doing the pulmonary rehab most days & have also completed the course & watched videos on inhaler techniques. I use the walking tile often as I've been shut in for the last months but wish the video is full screen.",

            "I live about 100kl from Brisbane the nearest area given.Does not give enough detail for allergies.This app is super easy to use,BUT it is at this moment 3 DAYS behind YYY .",
            "I counted on this app to help me adjust my medications, and now I've lost my voice because of allergy symptoms. At first I didn't understand why, but after I compared Sensio's forecasts with those from other allergy tracking sources in my area, I found out that Sensio had been saying allergens were very low, when they weren't. Don't count on this app.",
            "Useless and inaccurate, unfortunately. The app is intended to work with the (generally unavailable) monitoring devices sold by the company, but it seems to be linked to a monitor next to a coal furnace, since it 's always indicating dangerously high levels of particulate pollution.",
            "The idea is benefecial but there is a problem with Lebanon for example. The application gives a number of choices (Beirut, horsh, kaslik, ...) but they have been the same numbers and description for 3 days. No update for Lebanon, why is it included then? I checked for 2 European and North American cities and the info has been daily updated. Another issue, there is Israel with its capital Jerusalem! No other neighboring Arab states: Egypt, Jordan, Palestine... except UAE.",
            "This app is wonderful. I only gave 4 stars because I wish it was a bit more detailed, as in what kind of tree pollen and the individual levels for each tree being pick up in the air so I can better determine which one is triggering my symptoms."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

Let the timer and audio cues guide the rhythm of your breath as you breathe in and breathe out, inhaling the future and exhaling the past.\r\n\r\nPranayama (\"prana\" - life force, \"yama\" - regulation) is the conscious regulation & awareness of breath: the life force that both energizes and relaxes the body. It is no surprise that our breath can influence our physiology. Wim Hof, a Dutch extreme athlete, is noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures thanks to his breathwork. \r\n\r\nEven if you are not aiming to become an extreme athlete, you can enjoy the many benefits of breathwork such as strengthening your immune system (which can be confirmed by measuring your heart rate variability, a.k.a., HRV), improving your ability to deal with stress & anxiety, keeping asthma under control, etc.. In fact, you will notice an immediate sense of relaxation through a short minute of breathwork.\r\n\r\nDeep breathing doesn't help. What helps is rhythm.

Love that there are daily reminders, it helps cut through everyday distractions. But it should definitely be customizable, not fixed. Also, some sort of progress bar to visually complement the countdown would be nice and help me stay focused. PS. Kudos to the dev for being receptive & swift to act on feedback!",
            "The app is really awesome! Also one thing that would be awesome is, maybe try to use any android phone for the screenshots of the app. And also maybe optimuse the app for the speed. The app seems a wee bit clunky, but that's alright as it's a new app as of writi this review. We all need some meditation app. This a good one, a one time fee is great.",

            "Subject to update. Update: 2 stars to 4 stars. I've had the app several months. I originally complained about the failure to access my camera, which I did give permission - but it failed to access to the camera. I quit programming ages ago and will not be troubleshooting Zibdy further. Turns out, the dozen similar apps I tried weren't much better. All have strong AND weak points. I liked some features only Zibdy does well despite being labor intensive. Test results for example. Appreciate Zibdy's long delayed reply to my \"software illiteracy\" issue. I do hope they fix that glitch & assume others don't have the issue or would also complain about it. Give Zibdy a look if you're looking to track your health. Carezone was also worth looking at.",

            "I cannot get this version to run on Android. App keeps stopping \"Cair keeps stopping\" and asks to submit error report. I uninstalled app and reinstalled but still same problem on Galaxy S7. There are at least 100 apps on phone and all checked as working except the Cair app.",
            "The app works well - the device not so much. Also no Alexa integration as promised a couple of years ago. Overall, not so happy. I'm not in the U.K.",
            "Like the latest update especially the export data feature.",
            "I live beside a very busy road and I have my concerns about air quality as well as all the detergents and sprays we use indoors. Goodness knows what we are breathing in these days. I find the cair great for keeping an eye on air quality. Setup was easy enough and the app is intuitive. When it sends me an alert I can open the windows and watch it telling me how the air quality improves. I have it for a few weeks now and I think it is great value for money. Glad I bought one. Rory."

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

        "description": "Seasonal allergies, sometimes called \"hay fever\" or seasonal allergic rhinitis, are allergy symptoms that happen during certain times of the year, usually when outdoor molds release their spores, and trees, grasses, and weeds release tiny pollen particles into the air to fertilize other plants.\r\nThe immune systems of people who are allergic to mold spores or pollen treat these particles (called allergens) as invaders and release chemicals, including histamine, into the bloodstream to defend against them. It's the release of these chemicals that causes allergy symptoms.\r\nPeople can be allergic to one or more types of pollen or mold. The type someone is allergic to determines when symptoms happen. For example, in the mid-Atlantic states, tree pollination is February through May, grass pollen runs from May through June, and weed pollen is from August through October — so kids with these allergies are likely to have increased symptoms at those times. Mold spores tend to peak midsummer through the fall, depending on location.\r\nEven kids who have never had seasonal allergies in years past can develop them. Seasonal allergies can start at almost any age, though they usually develop by the time someone is 10 years old and reach their peak in the early twenties, with symptoms often disappearing later in adulthood.\r\nSeasonal allergies examples: Spring Allergies, Summer Allergies, Fall Allergies, Winter Allergies, Hay Fever, Pollen Allergies, Mold Allergy, Dust Allergy, Dog Allergy, Cat Allergy, allergy and asthma and allergic reaction rash.\r\nSeasonal allergies App Features:\r\n•\tWhat is Seasonal Allergies? \r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Symptoms.\r\n•\tHow to Control Your Seasonal Allergies.\r\n•\tNatural Seasonal Allergy Home Remedies.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Causes.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Diagnosis.\r\n•\tSeasonal Allergies Treatment.",

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "The breathing animation remains on for the entire breathing session and uses up considerable battery life.   Otherwise this is a great app,  very effective.  I have the paid version on galaxy note 5.",
            "My psychologist actually recommended this app to me! it really helps with \nmy anxiety and falling asleep, I don't have any issues with annoying ads \nwhat so ever :)",
            "total stress buster. I like the free version customization fine and the sounds are all fine too. Vedic is my favorite. I don't always do the full session but sometimes 1-2 minutes is enough. :)  Wish the app didn't need the screen; app closes when I turn my screen off.  other than that great app."

        "description": "Cards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\r\n\r\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.<br><br>Oh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. <br><br>Also, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. <br><br>There you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.<br><br>Privacy Policy:<br>http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. \r\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive. The symptoms of allergies resemble those of the common cold; however, they often last for more than two weeks and typically do not include a fever. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hay Fever Guide, Hay Fever Disease Management & Hay Fever Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hay Fever Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",

It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

Yeah, because that's TOTALLY a normal thing that apps ask for access to. Cool concept, failed execution.",

            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",

            "I used to love this game but since the latest update released on 29 October, the beam shot no longer works properly. It is only destroying the bubbles you can see on the screen and not to the top.",

There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",

I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors.

My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",

Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

        "description": "Allergic Reaction Treatment is An allergy and some types of allergic reactions may only cause mild discomfort, such as mild seasonal hay fever that can be controlled with over-the counter medicines or with no treatment at all. A more severe allergy can interfere with your life, reduce your enjoyment in activities, and become fatal. If this is the case, you should see a doctor for a comprehensive review and allergy testing.\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nallergy treatment\r\nallergies\r\nallergy medicine\r\nallergy testing\r\nbest allergy medicine\r\nfood intolerance test\r\nallergy\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about Allergic Reaction Treatment: \r\n\r\nThe body reacts to the release of the antibodies in various ways. Allergic reactions can attack any part of our body. They can attack the stomach, the nose, throat, sinuses, and lungs. Some of the allergic reactions your body might experience is nasal stuffiness, discharge, sneezing and itchy nose. Sometimes a reaction is accompanied by other symptoms such as itching in the ears or roof of the mouth.\r\n\r\nDuring an outbreak of common allergic reactions, eyes can be affected with conjunctivitis or red, itchy, and watery eyes. An allergen can make the skin appear to be red, itchy, and dry, hives or itchy welts as well. Asthma is among the common forms of allergic reactions. Asthma causes shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing. Asthma can become severe depending on the allergic reactions to a particular allergen.\r\n\r\nSeveral substances can cause allergic reactions. In fact, there are hundreds, but the most common allergens are:\r\n\r\n* Pollen. We can hardly avoid pollen if we spend any time outdoors at all.\r\n* Mold. Molds can be anywhere and in your home without you realizing it.\r\n* Dust. Household dusts and dust mites are inevitable in most homes.\r\n* Animals. Dander, urine, and oil from their skin can even become an allergen with varying allergic reactions.\r\n* Chemicals. Industrial chemicals commonly in household cleaners.\r\n* Food. A peanut allergy which can often be life threatening are actually pretty common.\r\n* Feathers. Some birds produce a powder to aid in preening, some produce so much they can coat nearby surfaces.\r\n* Insect Stings. A bee sting can sometimes be fatal.\r\n* Cockroaches and the waste they produce.\r\n\r\nAny race, age, gender, or social status can be affected by allergies. Allergic reactions seem to be more common in children but an adult can suffer any of these allergic reactions as well, even after years of remission. Allergic reactions can run in families even though it isn't yet understood why that happens. A specific allergy is not usually inherited, but a tendency to develop allergies is often passed down. If both parents have allergies, the child is likely to have allergies. However, the chance of developing allergies seems to be greater if the mother has allergies. An allergy can develop gradually over a period of time and can be caused by hormonal changes, stress, perfume, smoking, and other substances in the environment.\r\n\r\nYou can discover what allergy you have in one of two ways. The first is to have a blood test that measures the antibodies to a specific allergy sample and the other is the skin patch test method. Several well-known allergens are diluted and either injected into the skin or a small amount is place under the skin by a puncture or scratch. If a welt or red area appears on the skin it might mean the patient is allergic to that allergen.\r\n\r\nTreatments for allergy prone people may vary and are determined on your age, overall health, and medical history. Consideration will be given when deciding therapy options based on how bad the allergic reactions are and your tolerance of medications, as well as personal preferences. Occasionally a person may only need to change their lifestyle and take extra precautions that their home is dust and mold free.",

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....💐💐🧡 I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
