Helps in coping with realities and learn how to make the best of our wonderful gift of life. I assume most who download this app will be focusing on one particular area. Something IMPORTANT to remember is disease can become your friend, teacher and companion. May we NEVER FORGET when faced with disease that it is \"GOD who DECIDES\".",

The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD is a progressive disease, meaning it typically worsens over time. Eventually everyday activities, such as walking or getting dressed, become difficult. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD. The term \"chronic bronchitis\" is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years. Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests.  In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.",

        "description": "We started PulmonaryScan with one goal in mind: educate individuals with bad smoking/vaping habits about the dangers and health risks it imposes on their body, and possibly help them in their journey to become addiction-free. Watching our high school peers greatly harming their fundamental organs gave us a unique perspective on the widespread usage of harmful substances. Additionally, we also understood how pressing other lung issues were to society through research into lung-related diseases. Specifically, COPD was an affliction that we saw as extremely pressing. With that in mind, we thought that a free, quick COPD screening test could positively benefit users as well. After weeks of development, PulmonaryScan was born. With a simplistic design and easy to use interface, PulmonaryScan is divided into 5 sections, which are detailed below:\r\n\r\n\r\nSober Counter: The Sober Counter is a multi-faceted approach to helping those on a path to staying smoking free on their journey. First, the user is prompted to enter in the average amount of usage per week of Cigarettes, Juul Pods, or both. After that, the user will be taken to the main screen, where an auto-updating counter will tell the user how many days they have been able to stay abstinent from their smoking habit (if a user unfortunately consumes smoking products, they can easily hit the \"relapse\" button to start over). Additionally, the Sober Counter will also tell the user how much money they have saved in total over the course of their sober journey, as well as their expected savings of money over the course of the following month and year. This feature will allow the user to directly see the benefits of their tough fight against addiction, hopefully encouraging them to keep up their great work.\r\n\r\nThe COPD Screening test is an interactive questionnaire engineered by PulmonaryScan to help individuals discern if they need further evaluation by a medical professional regarding their COPD/Bronchitis/Emphysema symptoms. This examination is comprised of 8 short questions regarding one's symptoms and conditions, and one interactive question to examine the performance of the user's lungs. Results of the test will then be analyzed, and a recommendation regarding further examination will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nBody Map: The Body Map is an interactive interface in which users can tap into the different body systems to see how smoking specifically affects each part of one's body. Users can read the facts on how smoking affects the capabilities of one's Brain, Mouth/Throat, Heart, Lungs, Stomach, and Reproductive System.\r\n\r\nEffects of Vaping: Users will be taken to a screen where the raw facts of the downsides of Vaping are shown. Additionally, buttons are presented on the screen that lead to more supplementary reading on this harmful practice by leading scientific websites.\r\n\r\nPulmoDaily: This part of the app will directly take you to the PulmoDaily blog ran by PulmonaryScan CEO Mainur Khan. On the PulmoDaily blog, you can read the latest news in the Lung health world, recent advancements in the medical field, and much more.  \r\n\r\nPulmonaryScan is a living app that adapts when new information presents itself, much like Science. The app is inspected every 2 weeks for data fallacies and bug issues. In efforts to maintain optimal user feedback, please visit www.pulmonaryscan.com and fill out the form on the main page if you notice any issue occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe Team:\r\nFounder, Lead Architect, & Chief of Medical Research: Mainur Khan\r\nChief Operating Officer & Lead Application Developer: Pranav Venkatesh\r\nChief Technology Officer & Lead Research Developer: Varun Arumugam\r\nCo- Chief of Business Operations & Digital Media Chief: Kishan Patel\r\nCo- Chief of Business Operations: Shashank Kashyap\r\nMedical Research Developer: Deepak Katta\r\n\r\nInstagram: @pulmonaryscan\r\n\r\nIf we have used your product without permission, please contact us at team@pulmonaryscan.com",

It's helped with MANY health conditions that drs had no answer for.. few hundred for my life back is nothing.",

Now my normal breathing is changing to breathing little, in real life. I need to keep my eyes off the clock. I haven't returned to my normal biking routine.",

All the levels at once which is quite a bit of money (over $200) for I wish you could buy level by level through Google play store, instead of signing for an account with your email. They probably spam you with emails to . So far the app work fine. Needs improvement of course. I know the method and it works. Also use a frolov devise.",

            "This is very good app for the people who are beginners in pranayama. There are few issues in app though. It stucks during bhramari, meditative breathing and kapalbharti. I have latest version of app still I am facing this issue. Hope this bug is resolved in upcoming version.",
            "Really very nice app.Just one change I would like to suggest if you can do.when we do Pranayam,we have to inhale and exhale from different nostrils.In our app it speaks only inhale and exhale. Just edit right or left, though it's written but while doing Pranayam ,can't see in mobile.So please do needful.Overall this is the BEST app for doing Pranayam.I suggest everyone who wants to do Pranayam at home must download this app.Thanks for making this app.",
            "Simply learn yoga. It's been over 2years, I am using this app. Just add the below mentioned suggestions (to which I agree too), it will add 'char chand' to it.",
            "Good app, but the app is not giving vibration between intervals of pranayama, how to solve",

Very off putting on an otherwise good app.",

Download now!<br><br>BAP-65 score in &quot;Respiratory COPD Exacerbation - BAP-65 Score&quot; app correlates well with both in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD. The BAP-65 system is a score composed of 4 variables. All of them are available upon presentation to the hospital. The B letter stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and it is positive if level is above 25 mg/dL. The A letter stands for Altered Mental Status and it is counted positive when the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 14 or less, or when the physician has designated that the patient was disoriented, stuporous or in coma. The P letter stands for Pulse and it is positive when the initial pulse is above 109 beats/min. Finally, an additional point will be added if the patient was above 65 years old. <br> <br>Disclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment.

            "This app is very good. I have installed other anatomy apps, but found the design is backward i.e they are designed to make you buy. As such they install a mass of garbage, which fails on many platforms and slows everything. This app. is lean and very well made. It is focused. Thanks",

            "Very useful to understand our own body. It's easy for students to go hand to hand. It makes imagination easy. We are using it to train health workers with non medical background. They all who don't know English are happy with it. Good job.👍",
            "this app, especially for being FREE, is a lifesaver for anybody having to master Anatomy! not only do you have the ability to dissect, make things transparent, flip, rotate, travel in and up and out of different body systems, etc.. just to name a few. This is an unbelievable tool for anyone having to master a difficult subject matter like Anatomy. literally saved me !"

            "The single best anatomy app I have ever used. I wish they kept adding more to it. Like adding the laryngeal prominence (Adam's apple) to the thyroid gland/larynx section, and a section to get even more specific with each round. With more anatomical features. Very addicting, can proudly say this has helped me a tonne with med school. Strongly recommend learning all this app has to offer inside out.",
            "It's a great app, it surves the propose of quizzing Anatomy. But, unfortunately when it comes to Med Students, it's still superficial. It need to.be added a bunch of other structures and break In parts some bones and vessels to define the fine Anatomy.",
            "I played it since elementary because I aspire to be a doctor or at least in the medical field someday. The best!",
            "Very good app, I just wish it had more content! It would be so useful to have each of the muscles in every region!",
            "This game really helped me when it came to basic anatomy. I recommended this to my fellow students in my class and will continue to recommend it."

It is perfectly natural to breathe through the mouth at certain terms such as when running or lifting heavy objects, however if breathing occurs through the mouth habitually then it can lead to many health problems. These problems can be particularly severe for children as mouth breathing can affect the long term development of the face and jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n In this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nasthma\r\nshortness of breath\r\nbreathing problems\r\ncopd treatment\r\ntrouble breathing\r\nlung problems\r\ndifficulty breathing\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about Breathing Problems Treatment : \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that almost 80% of people suffer from a deviated nasal septum and Septoplasty is one treatment which has been helping them overcome the problems caused by it. Nasal septum is a wall like lining in the nose which separates the cavities of the nose into two equal halves. Ideally this wall should be in the midline of the nose thereby making equal passages on the right and left sides. The nasal septum consists of a central cartilage which provides support and is covered with mucus membrane on both sides. If this septum is not in the midline of the nose or is deviated, it can cause severe breathing problems.\r\n\r\nCauses, Symptoms and Effects\r\n\r\nNasal septum deviation can be caused either through some injury to the nose or it can even be present by birth. Excessive growth of the skeleton system can also be a reason for deviated septum and cause the nasal passages to be blocked. Some of the most common symptoms of a deviated nasal septum are blockages in either one or both nostrils, obstructed breathing, nasal congestions, chronic sinus, infections, bleeding of the nose, snoring, breathing through the mouth, headaches and facial pain.\r\n\r\nPeople suffering from deviated nasal septum often complain about breathing obstruction, congestion, headaches and sinusitis troubles. This deviation can significantly obstruct the flow of air from the nasal passage as well as not allow a nose to be completely clear of the sinus and mucus drainage. In extreme cases, the deviation could also affect the outward structure of the nose causing it to alter shape and leave the nose looking collapsed. In such cases, Rhinoplasty - a type of cosmetic surgery is the only way to correct it.\r\n\r\nHow Septoplasty works\r\n\r\nSeptoplasty is the most effective treatment for correcting a deviated nasal septum. This process is conducted via the nostrils, thereby ensuring that there are no bruises and no signs of surgery. The procedure involves realigning the portion of cartilage or bone which is bent in the nasal cavity. Local or general anaesthesia administered before the process and an incision is made via the nostrils on the septum to reach the affected area. It is ensured that there is sufficient cartilage being preserved so that it can provide structural support to the nose. After aligning the septum to the correct position, it is given a temporary stability with the help of small plastic sutures. \r\n\r\nSeptoplasty has helped a lot of patients to completely or partially eliminate the symptoms of deviated nasal septum. This procedure clears the blockage of the nose passage thereby allowing smooth breathing and clear nostrils. It also helps in avoiding any chronic infections or sinus that could have developed due to the obstruction as well as provides a structural support to the nose and preventing and facial damage",

The design of this feature emphasized ease of use and interactive user interface principles. The “Learn COPD” feature includes information about the lung and COPD impact in general.\r\n\r\nSmoking Cessation:\r\nSmoking cessation feature helps patients with text awareness nonfictions. MyLung app asks patients to assess the smoking consumption level and to measures their ability to quit smoking by completing a questionnaire. Based on the questionnaire answers, smoking patients will receive personalized motivational messages.\r\n\r\nOutdoor Pollution:\r\nThis feature raises awareness about the risk of outdoor pollution. Breathing clean air is essential to maintain healthy lifestyle. With this feature, patients will be receiving notifications about pollution level based on their current geolocation. The information of the air index will be provided from World Air Quality Index AQI API.  \r\n\r\nMonitoring Feature:\r\nThis feature allows patients to self-monitor their symptoms and daily activities. The COPD symptoms will be entered as scale measurements using a short Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). CCQ measures health status and assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with COPD. The CCQ is a 10-item that are divided into three domains: symptom state, functional state and mental state. Patients are required to respond to each item on a seven-point Likert scale like. The symptoms include breathlessness, mucus level, fatigue, and cough.",

            "I'm using this on a Redmi 8A. The first few months this app worked very well, I even bought the subscription, but looks like I wasted my money. This app hangs every single time I try to open it. It gets stuck on 100% loading and I have to uninstall it and install it again. It often misbehaves and directs me to another window when I'm viewing something. I do not always have access to fast internet and I have to wait for a long time to download it just for a one time use. Very disappointing."

The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

It is organized and managed in a way I can focus and learn it without getting carried away by my emotions! Thank you so much for creating these apps! I have been looking for something like this for years!",
            "I am an Unwinding Anxiety subscriber. Through that app I found Jud's mindfulness exercises to be incredibly helpful. (The UA program has been a game changer for me as well). But the auto-reminders on the UA app kept failing. So I began using a different app for those, but never w/same success. Although \"Breathe by Dr. Jud\" doesnt offer reminders (yet), BbDJ makes the mindfulness exercises far more easily accessible. I will be using this one from now on.",

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in hand😁",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

You can use the ? feature to test yourself on muscles (so when you click on a muscle, you try and guess, and then click ? to see the answer). Also you can quiz yourself on the muscle attachments. I like that it uses the proper Latin terms too. I still use the app daily in massage to see muscle movement, and to search for a correct muscle name for soap notes. Thank you!",

Symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. Bronchitis is divided into two types: acute and chronic.\r\nBronchitis is an infection of the main respiratory tract of the lung or bronchus that causes inflammation or inflammation of the canal. This condition is included as one of the respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nAcute bronchitis is also known as a chest cold. Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks. In more than 90% of cases the cause is a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due to high levels of air pollution or bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs to help with the fever.\r\n\r\nThe initial sign of bronchitis is usually a persistent dry cough that is associated with an upper respiratory infection. Second, sputum is coughed up from the lungs. First it may be white and clear. As the bronchial infection progresses, the sputum thickens and is no long white. On the contrary, it will be either yellow, green, or brown. If there is a thick, pus-filled discharge, this suggests a bacterial infection.",

        "title": "ECG / EKG Rhythm Step-by-Step Interpretation",
        "description": "An ECG stands for an \"electrocardiogram,\" which is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart. It is used by doctors to obtain important diagnostic information surrounding cardiovascular and/or respiratory conditions. Fortunately, it is a simple and non-invasive procedure that requires very little preparation.\r\n\r\nAn electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of your heart. This test can help determine the cause of symptoms you might be having or check the overall health of your heart. Reading a basic EKG is not that hard. However, you should always let your doctor or medical professional properly read your EKG and diagnose you.\r\n\r\nEKG: EKG Interpretation Made Easy: A Complete Step-By-Step Guide to 12-Lead EKG/ECG Interpretation & Arrhythmias\r\n\r\nMaster Your EKG Interpretation With This Comprehensive Guide!\r\nSystematic Approaches and Key Steps for All Areas of Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this guide is to teach you to spot and accurately interpret the abnormalities that can occur on the EKG. By the end of the guide, you will be able to confidently navigate and interpret the complex road map of electrical activity and quickly evaluate all the main pointers correctly. This will put you on a steady path to being able to recognize abnormalities early and provide the best care for your patients!\r\nCovered in the ‘Interpretation Made Easy’ guide are the following areas:\r\n\r\nEKG Basics\r\nUnderstanding the Intervals\r\nThe 12-Lead EKG\r\nCalculating the Heart Rate\r\nEvaluating the Rhythm\r\nSinus Arrhythmias\r\nAtrial Arrhythmias\r\nVentricular Arrhythmias\r\nDetermining the Axis\r\nHeart Block\r\nSinus Block\r\nAV Block\r\nBundle Branch Block\r\nMyocardial Ischemia and Infarction\r\nAnd Much More!\r\n\r\nThis is all presented with clear explanations, photos, and diagrams\r\n\r\n\r\n455 full size, real life ECG strips\r\n\r\nStrips presented three ways: identified by type of problem, randomized, and embedded in case studies\r\n\r\nArrhythmia chapters each include practice strips to analyze rhythm, rate, interval, interpretation, etc.\r\n\r\nFull color illustrations offer a quick review of cardiac anatomy and physiology\r\n\r\nClinical Tips and Hints dispersed throughout provide valuable information on rhythm interpretation and how an arrhythmia can affect a patient.\r\n\r\nIncludes a chapter on myocardial infarction and 12-lead ECG\r\n\r\nFour 75-strip practice tests\r\n\r\nAppendices include guidelines for CPR, ACLS, and emergency medical skills and medications\r\n\r\nDesigned to also be useful for recertification review\r\n\r\nHeart Structure and Electrical Activity\r\n\r\n1. Anatomy and Physiology of the Heart\r\n\r\n2. The Electrocardiogram\r\n\r\nECG Interpretation Made Incredibly Easy! Fifth Edition makes learning to read and interpret rhythm strips simple. This practical reference uses a unique, conversational writing style that breaks down complex concepts and information to make ECG interpretation easier to understand. Fully updated and now in full color, the book reviews fundamental cardiac anatomy and physiology, explains how to obtain and interpret a rhythm strip, and teaches the reader how to recognize and treat sinus, atrial, and ventricular arrhythmias as well as heart blocks.

When you have asthma, you need to be under the care of a doctor who can track the various changes of the disease, your reaction to medications and treat accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this app we will discuss:\r\n\r\nsigns of asthma\r\nasthma medications\r\nasthma\r\nasthma symptoms\r\nasthma treatment\r\ninhaler\r\nasthma inhalers\r\nasthma action plan\r\nasthma attack\r\nunderstanding of asthma attacks\r\nasthma attack understanding\r\nthe value of asthma attack and bronchial asthma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature on the app\r\n\r\n_ update once a week\r\n_ useful tips that you will provide\r\n_ a very simple look in the app.\r\n\r\nlittle explanation about asthma medications: \r\n\r\nWhat Causes Asthma?\r\n\r\nIt has been determined that asthma now affects one out of 15 children in North America and is the most common chronic illness among young ones. This affliction is the result of chronic inflammation of bronchial tubes in the lungs. When these tubes become sensitive to certain allergens or irritants, they overreact and swell. When exposed to these irritants, the inflammation of these tubes will eventually constrict breathing.\r\n\r\nThere are several causes for this illness. Besides allergies, asthma can be stress-related, weight-related or job-related. Higher stress levels in the body tend to change the immune system and cause more inflammation of the air passage. Obesity is another contributor to this painful medical issue. Certain occupations with poor air quality have also been linked to this problem.\r\n\r\nCommon Symptoms \r\nThere are several common symptoms that indicate a person has this disease but it can vary from person to person. They are shortness of breath, wheezing with a whistling or hissing sound when breathing, coughing, and tightness of the chest. They tend to show themselves with excessive exercise, cold air, or at night time.\r\n\r\nThe Goal Of Asthma Treatment \r\nIn terms of diagnosis, the number one problem of this illness is that it resembles many other respiratory and heart conditions. There are many prevalent medicines that are commonly administered in this case. But, medications always show a better result when given on a case to case basis.\r\n\r\nAfter a physical exam to find the severity of the attacks and a medical history to list possible triggers, the doctor will plan a long-term treatment of medications to take on a daily basis. Medications must be closely supervised by your doctor. So tell your doctor about any good reactions or bad side effects as soon as it happens.\r\n\r\nTypes Of Asthma Medications \r\nMedications used for treatment are bronchodilators, which relax the bronchial spasms, and corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation. Inhaled medications are preferred as they immediately are breathed into the affected area. These produce less side effects than oral medications of tablet or liquid medicines. Medications must be closely supervised by your doctor. So tell your doctor about any good reactions or bad side effects as soon as it happens.\r\n\r\nPossible Side Effects \r\nThere are hundreds of drugs related to treating this disease that are being dispersed every day. Anyone prescribed any kind of medication for this condition would be wise to check the Internet for side effects. Adrenaline, for example, is a medication that is still used on occasion but can result in rapid heart rate, nausea, vomiting, headache, restlessness and a sense of panic.\r\n\r\nSpecial care should be taken with any asthma medication to be sure it is safe before using. Some people can take asthma medication with no ill effects. With others, a number of side effects have been reported. In addition to the above, other medicines are listed as causing seizures, heart failure, cirrhosis, high blood pressure, insomnia hives, bone fractures and too many others side effects to list. Many over the counter medicines also have side effects which are required, by law, to be listed in the package.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "description": "Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\r\n\r\nAnatomy and physiology of all 12 body systems\r\n\r\n12 units: cells and tissues, integumentary, skeleton and joints, muscle types, nervous, endocrine, circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive \r\n\r\nWhat Is Anatomy and Physiology?\r\nAnatomy is the study of the structure and relationship between body parts.\r\nPhysiology is the study of the function of body parts and the body as a whole.

This Free App provides 20 and more different Natural Alternative Therapies for Asthma Attack. When it comes to understanding all of the new asthma treatments available, it's natural to feel a little confused.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is that asthma is a \"variable\" disease. In other words, the symptoms can vary from person to person, and even the same person's condition may fluctuate throughout the year.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, people have become more aware of complementary therapies and their use for treating various medical conditions, such as asthma. There are many reasons why some people choose to use complementary therapies. For example, they:\r\nmay want to reduce the amount of medicines or inhalers they use \r\nmay prefer to use a “natural” alternative \r\nmay be disillusioned with the approach of Western medicine\r\nhave heard from others that a particular complementary therapy works well for their condition\r\nfeel that using complementary therapies gives them more control over their treatment. \r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your asthma, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. \r\nIt is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nWhat allergies trigger Asthma, or asthma related cough.. What are the Asthma treatment guidelines?\r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to relieve asthma is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their Asthma Attack  with alternative techniques.\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments.  This app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your asthma problems and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I just installed the app on my old Samsung Galaxy A10e and tried it out. It works perfectly. The visuals are beautiful, and the music, sounds of nature, and the soothing vocals are super calming and relaxing. Now, I need to buy an external speaker so that I can put it by my bedside to help me fall asleep. Thank you for this wonderful device.",
            "Bluetooth connection between the app and finger clip. Why the app need precise gps location permission ? User location nothing to do with the hrv and relax breathing exercise.",
            "Will not pair (Bluetooth) with OX200 even though it seems it. No pairing, no connection, no data.... I agree with others, app asked for way more permissions than necessary. Removing from my phone and will not bother to try a later version. Not worth it. [edit] After being told to try again, it still does not pair. (Yes, it is on my finger). Even if it did work, the permissions required by the app are excessive. Deleting app. Using device standalone.",
            "I love this app! Has a whole bunch of different layouts and features. Unfortunately it didn't work on my other phone but very glad I didn't give up on trying it on this phone. Assuming it works it is GREAT! (only thing is I wish all of the backgrounds, and not just some, showed up in higher resolution)",
            "I bought the Relaxation Coach Pulse Oximeter because it could measure my blood oxygen saturation levels and show me a histogram, which I thought I may be able to use to detect a relatively asymptomatic case of COVID-19 (I worry about infecting my dad) but what I found was also a powerful relaxation tool! TO ONE STAR REVIEWERS: It's asking for media permissions because you can: A) Take snapshots of the various histograms and reports. B) Use your own music during stress exercises, if you want!"

I'm also pretty impressed with the overall quality of the audio & video. I didn't encounter not one issue, delay or any cause to roll my eyes throughout the whole 75 minute call. Pretty Sweet!",
            "Love this app! It has all your history of your health, doctor and ER visits, as well as all of the shots or medications that you have ever been put on with dates and detailed info of visits, or surgeries that you have had in your past.",
            "Had an appt for my daughter with the EAP that we waited a couple of weeks for. I downloaded the app and set up an account a week in advance. We joined our appt 15 min early. When the appt time came the provider's video wouldn't connect. We were connected to wifi and had a strong signal. We kept waiting and about 10 min after appt time we got a notification that the provider had canceled the appt. We didn't get a call, the appt was just canceled due to the provider's connectivity problem.",
            "I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice. It's very difficult when you are trying to do psychotherapy about trauma and halfway through the connection dies or you can't hear your provider anymore. This needs lots of work!",
            "The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare."

However, if you can get back to your basics and set things straight at the elementary level, brushing your teeth should be the first home remedy for bad breath that you should resort to. Remember that food particles that stick between your teeth, as well as other candy or chocolates that would smear your teeth in sugar, are natural recipes for bad breath, and developing a regular habit of brushing your teeth twice a day would be among the prime home remedies for bad breath. It would not only aid as a prevention tool and cure for bad breath, but would also ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy for a long while to come.\r\nRinsing your Mouth\r\nSo, what could you do when you do not have a tooth brush and paste handy and would want to minimize scope for bad breath? it all around your mouth and spit it out for fresh feel especially after your meals.\r\n\r\nCarry a Toothbrush:\r\nThat doesn’t cost much to do either, given that all it takes is some mindful action on your part to carry a toothbrush and mini-toothpaste with you, especially when you know you have an appointment, a meeting or a date waiting for you.\r\n\r\nSalt Water:\r\n\r\nSalt water is among one of the universal home remedies for bad breath and for a lot of other ailments. In the case of bad breath, you need to gargle warm water, with adequate and tolerable amount of rock salt, added to it. Salt has the inherent capacity to nullify bacteria and to sterilize the area that it is exposed to. Regular gargling of warm water and salt every morning immediately after you brush your teeth and every night before you go to bed is a useful and effective home remedy for bad breath.\r\n\r\nMint Leaves:\r\n\r\nMint generally refers to spearmint, which is a flowering plant with a host of health benefits. Mint has traditionally been used to treat infections in the chest as well as of the stomach, while mint leaves have been powdered and used in the ancient ages to whiten teeth. \r\nParsley\r\n \r\nYoghurt and Buttermilk:\r\n\r\nYoghurt, and its dilute cousin, butter milk, are known widely for their goodness for the health and the digestive system\r\n\r\nFenugreek Seed Tea:\r\nAnother natural remedy for bad breath is to consume Fenugreek seed tea on a regular basis. Fenugreek seeds are available as whole dried seeds as well as powder, which are known for their health benefits in aiding digestion and in treating digestion problems. \r\nClove:\r\nA simple home remedy for bad breath would be to chew a piece of clove. Clove is known for its strong flavor and has been extensively used in Indian cuisine for its aroma as well as health benefits of clove. Of.\r\n\r\nLemon:\r\nAnother natural remedy for bad breath features lemon, the commonly available citrus that is refreshing and enticing. As mentioned earlier, you could drink Fenugreek tea for bad breath, and you could also add a tinge of lemon for taste and freshness, even as lemon acts in eliminating bad breath\r\nCardamom\r\n\r\nAnother natural remedy for bad breath is cardamom, the herbal spice known for its strong and peculiar aroma. Cardamom is widely used in cooking, to add flavor and fragrance to dishes, and it has widely accepted medicinal properties. \r\nFennel Seeds  \r\n\r\nFennel Tea\r\n\r\nGiven the goodness of fennel seeds on the digestive system and its usefulness in treating bad breath, you could also opt for fennel tea, where you could heat up a few fennel seeds in water, filter out the seeds and use the solution as herbal mouthwash, turning out to be an effective home remedy for bad breath.",

But MyTherapy is more than a free medication reminder: Combining a pill tracker, mood tracker and a health journal, e.g. with a weight tracker, this medication reminder app allows you and your doctor to put your treatment’s success into perspective. ⏰ 💊🔔\r\n\r\n💊Key Features \r\n• Pill reminder app for all medications\r\n• Pill tracker with logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes\r\n• Support for wide range of dosing schemes within medication reminder\r\n• Track your tablets, dose, measurements, activities as a comprehensive health journal\r\n• Family sharing\r\n• Share your printable health journal with your doctor\r\n• Personalized tips for your treatment\r\n• Wide range of measurements for all conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, hypertension, multiple sclerosis) e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels\r\n\r\n⏰Comprehensive meds reminder \r\nWe designed a medicine reminder app that puts all your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (tablet, pill, inhalation, …) frequency, and even refill reminders. And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together. And you can even have your family see if you’ve missed a med despite the pill reminder, so they can help you stay on track.\r\nMyTherapy is for you, no matter if you are taking antibiotic medicines or deal with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression that are often complicated. MyTherapy is medication tracker and health journal. Have peace of mind from medicine reminders and health tracker.\r\n\r\n🔒Privacy\r\nMyTherapy is available for free and no registration is required!

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

La existencia de microorganismos resistentes y su variabilidad entre hospitales e incluso dentro de las diferentes áreas de un mismo hospital hace necesario un buen conocimiento de la epidemiología microbiológica local. La selección óptima del antimicrobiano y su posología en los diferentes síndromes infecciosos requieren también una formación específica y actualizada.\r\n\r\nCon el ánimo de promover una utilización más adecuada de los antimicrobianos la Comisión de Infección Hospitalaria del Hospital Son Espases (Palma de Mallorca, España) ha actualizado con esta tercera edición los protocolos de actuación en enfermedades infecciosas.\r\n\r\nCon el formato app del manual de protocolos queremos facilitar la difusión y utilización de estos protocolos, y hacerlos accesibles y de fácil lectura para que resulten de utilidad en la práctica clínica diaria.

            "This is definitely the best air quality app I have found. It's easy to use, and being able to compare different locations at a glance is very useful for me, because the pollution varies a lot surrounding me because of mountains. I also appreciate that Plume uses their own air quality index based on more recent health research than the federal government's.",
            "Fun app (great design), really well made and the forecasts are amazing. Also the scale is very interesting, very granular, currently (September 2020) in the Pacific Northwest we have the worst air quality in the world and every other air quality system is maxed out and has been for quite some time. It's hard to tell exactly how terrible it is, not these guys, super granular!",
            "It's a useful app, but I do question the accuracy of its live data. I'm in the middle of the California wildfires, and I've seen this app read much lower than Airnow, only to retroactively update its historical readings. Example: at 3pm I might see a live reading of 80 AQI. But then at 8pm, the app tells me the AQI was 120 at 3pm. And when this happens, it's always that the live reading is low! This is very frustrating and dangerous if the app is consistently on the low side. Developers??",
            "Terribly inaccurate. Kirkland, WA got AQI over 150 last Tuesday 9/8/20, and this sole app says it was OK under 100. Now all others show below 200 and this one above. All days in between are also in stark contrast with reality. I believe that this app isn't based on measured data but on \"best\" (?) guessing. Just want the authors to publish their sources, as this is all about public health. I can't trust this app to see if I'm OK to open the windows, let some fresh air to come in.",
            "Not accurate. How do I know? Large AQI spikes in Plume's own data history that weren't there in the live or forecasted AQI. This is has the best UI of all the ones I've looked at but if the data for my health is garbage... Also as of the new update I get forecast notifications all the time despite the notification settings being toggled off. No reply from the developers to my email. Please do better, I want to love this app."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

Good, then keep reading!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is heart disease? The latest definition of heart disease is any disease that affects how the heart normally works. Narrowing or hardening of the arteries that lead to the heart is the most common type of cardiac disease, today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course this can encompass quite a few types or variations of heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of heart disease include:\r\n\r\n* Alcoholic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Aortic regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Aortic stenosis\r\n\r\n* Arrhythmias\r\n\r\n* Cardiogenic shock\r\n\r\n* Congenital heart disease\r\n\r\n* Coronary artery disease (CAD)\r\n\r\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Endocarditis\r\n\r\n* Heart attack (myocardial infarction)\r\n\r\n* Heart failure\r\n\r\n* Heart tumor\r\n\r\n* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Idiopathic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Acute mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Chronic mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Mitral stenosis\r\n\r\n* Mitral valve prolapse\r\n\r\n* Peripartum cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Pulmonary stenosis\r\n\r\n* Stable angina\r\n\r\n* Unstable angina\r\n\r\n* Tricuspid regurgitation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are many categories of what actually constitutes heart disease.

And we will cover the most common causes below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly, here are some causes:\r\n\r\n* Hypertension (“high blood pressure”)\r\n\r\n* Heart valves that do not function normally\r\n\r\n* Electrical conduction of the heart that causes an abnormal rhythm.\r\n\r\n* Heart’s pumping function that is affected by toxins or infections.\r\n\r\n* Congenital or “birth defects” of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many People Are Affected By Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, there are approximately 70.1 million people affected by some type of cardiac disorder! Heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death in the US.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong minorities, cardiac disease or heart disease, ranks first as leading cause of death. The rates of deaths declined for those groups with the exception of one group, American Indian females. The time frame for this study was between 1985 and 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween 1992 and 2002, the percentage of decline of death rates for CHD (Cardiac Heart Diseas) was the highest among white males and the least decline was in the black female population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Impact Of Cardiac Heart Disease\r\n\r\nBesides the horrific costs of CHD in terms of personal tragedy, society also bears the brunt of the effects of this disease. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the study, 2005 costs for CVD(Cardiovascular Disease) were staggering. Overall, costing 393 Billion Dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCosts broke down like this:\r\n\r\n* 242 Billion Dollars for direct health care costs.\r\n\r\n* 35 Billion Dollars for indirect costs of morbidity.\r\n\r\n* 117 Billion Dollars in DIRECT costs of mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, cardiovascular disease is one that while complicated and intricate in name and causes, is simply devastating to both the individual and to the society that the affected comes from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be taken very seriously and not ignored, so education and prevention are essential in decreasing the effects of these diseases, commonly know as cardiac disease.",

As someone going into the field of emotional research, I can tell you THAT is what the science says.",

            "This is a pretty good app that is continuously improving. There are still some bugs that need worked out, and I wish there was a system for reporting these. For example, the self-regulate exercise doesn't allow me to adjust the 1-10 scales. Also, the positive affirmations exercise never seems to complete, and I can never get progress points for it.",

I was prompted to sign up and download and ultimately use the app, which I completed in entirety, yet I haven't been credited at all on the originating survey panel like I was promised to receive! It was through the survey panel named Attapoll for the amount of $1.04! Please resolve this!",

        "description": "Batuk tidak bisa digolongkan sebagai penyakit. Batuk adalah  sebuah respon yang diberikan oleh sistem daya tahan tubuh di saluran pernapasan yang dikirim melewati syaraf  menuju pusat batuk di otak. Tujuan tubuh melakukan aktivitas batuk adalah untuk mengeluarkan sisa makanan yang masih tersisa di kerongkongan, berekasi terhadap asap, debu, lendir dan lain sebagainya yang berada di dalam bagian  reseptor (penerima rangsang) batuk seperti di saluran pernapasan, hidung dan telinga.\r\n\r\nDilihat dari jenisnya, batuk bisa dibedakan menjadi dua tipe, yaitu batuk berdahak dan juga batuk kering. Keduanya sama-sama menyiksa, namun batuk berdahak jauh lebih merepotkan disbanding batuk kering. Batuk berdahak akan mengganggu aktivitas, dan lender yang ada di dalam tenggotokan, tidak akan berhenti keluar sampai kita meludahkannya.\r\n\r\nSeringkali kita mengandalkan obat dari dokter atau apotek untuk menyembuhkan batuk berdahak. Padahal untuk menyembuhkannya, kita bisa membuat sendiri dari bahan-bahan tradisional yang mudah didapat di sekitar kita. Sebelum kita mengungkap lebih lanjut mengenai apa saja obat tradisional yang muncul, kita perlu belajar mengetahui penyebab batuk yang mengganggu aktivitas.\r\n\r\nApa saja yang menyebabkan batuk\r\n\r\nSecara umum penyebab batuk adalah bakteri dan virus. Daya tahan tubuh yang melemah, menjadi penyebab utamanya. Meskipun begitu, masih ada penyebab lainnya yang bisa jadi merupakan gejala penyakit lain yang kadang luput dari perhatian, sebagai berikut:\r\n\r\nPenyakit akut yang sering kambuh adalah jenis penyakit yang awalnya tidak terdeteksi namun menyebabkan anda sering batuk-batuk. Contohnya seperti PPOJ (Penyakit Paru Obstruktif Kronik), batuk disertai sesak nafas karena asma dan bronkitis parah.\r\n    \r\nAnda pernah mengalami batuk dan bersin di saat bersamaan ketika mencium bunga atau berada di padang bunga? Itu adalah Rinitis alergi. Alergi tersebut merupakan intoleransi saluran pernapasan pada serbuk sari atau serbuk bunga.\r\n\r\nPenyakit asam lambung akut atau istilah medisnya GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux). GERD adalah penyakit yang terjadi saat asam lambung menuju ke kerongkongan karena lemahnya katup penutup. Gejala dari penyakit tersebut adalah batuk disertai nyeri pada dada. GERD juga bisa menyebabkan batuk kronis.\r\n\r\nApakah anda pernah batuk-batuk terus di tengah jalan atau di samping orang yang sedang merokok? Itu tandanya anda sensitif dengan polusi atau asap. Polusi yang terhirup pasti akan menimbulkan reaksi di tubuh. Reaksi pertamanya setelah polusi terhirup adalah batuk-batuk keras.\r\n\r\nSuburnya pertumbuhan spora jamur di alam dan di lingkungan rumah juga merupakan salah satu faktor pemicu batuk dan  sesak napas. Aroma jamur spora yang cenderung lembab, tidak terlalu bagus untuk dihirup.\r\n\r\nAda juga batuk yang justru disebabkan setelah menelan obat. Salah satunya adalah sakit batuk setelah menelan obat ACE inhibitor. Obat tersebut adalah jenis obat yang dipakai untuk menurunkan angka hipertensi di dalam darah dan juga mengobati gagal jantung. Efek buruk dari penderita yang menelan ACE inhibitor akan sering menderita batuk kering. Batuk kering akan terjadi setelah pasien justru sudah sembuh sepenuhnya dari maag akut yang diderita.\r\n\r\nPartusis atau batuk rejan adalah batuk yang menandai adanya penyakit demam, flu dan juga batuk yang membuat penderita kesulitan dalam bernapas. Batuk rejan ini dapat diidap penderita hingga berminggu-minggu. Semakin lama kondisi vitalitas tubuh membaik,maka batuk rejan akan lama sembuhnya.\r\n\r\nSetelah memahami penyebab batuk pada anda,sekarang kita masuk ke pembahasan tentang obat alami yang bagus untuk menyembuhkan batuk berdahak.",

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

        "description": "Mumps is a viral disease caused by the mumps virus. Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, poor appetite, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), inflammation of the heart, permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. \r\nMumps is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among people living in close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans get and spread the disease. People are infectious to each other from about seven days before the start of symptoms to about eight days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of the parotid duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Mumps Guide, Mumps Disease Management & Mumps Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Mumps Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "I am still quite new to this app. I like the selection, the dark mode, and that it can disappear while still playing. I don't like how messy it is. Visually distracting and distressing. Too much to look at or see at one time.",
            "I been using it for about 2yrs now I'm satisfied I'm able to listen to stations all over the world if you don't mind the commercials this is the app for you, anything goes wrong reboot it or the wifi continue to work no problem.",
            "This app used to be pretty good for listening to radio stations (which is why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1), but lately its ad to music ratio has gotten very high. For example, I use it to listen to music while I exercise. This morning, the last SIX MINUTES of my workout were solid ads. I don't mind the odd ad between every couple of songs, but not for six straight minutes. I'm removing this app and finding something else for my music listening.",
            "It has stability problem. Many times suddenly it stops until you open it again and play your favorite channel. It's really frustrating. Plz do something for this problem."

Diseases under heart disease include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease is heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.\r\n\r\nThe term \"heart disease\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cardiovascular disease.\" Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. \r\nSymptoms can include:\r\n\r\n1.\tChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\r\n2.\tShortness of breath\r\n3.\tPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in \r\n        those parts of your body are narrowed\r\n4.\tPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back\r\n5.\tChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\r\n6.\tShortness of breath\r\n7.\tPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in \r\n        those parts of your body are narrowed\r\n8.\tPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back\r\n        Risk factors\r\n•\tAge.

The 6WT should give an assessment of the objective functional impairment (OFI) of patients with degenerative spinal diseases, as many disease-specific factors (pain, muscle weakness, etc.) have an influence on the test result.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this test is to walk as long and as far as possible during 6 minutes without jogging or running. You can wear your normal shoes and use a walking aid if necessary. If you experience severe pain, leg weakness or gait instability during the test, you can slow down or stop and sit down. If you experience significant symptoms of your back condition, you should press the \"Flash\" button on the app's user interface (=Time/Distance To First Symptoms). However, if the symptoms allow it, you should continue walking as soon as possible until the 6 minutes are over.\r\n\r\nIn general, we recommend conducting the measurements at a place where no blockades of the GPS signal are to be expected (e.g. dirt road on an open field, neighborhood environment without high buildings), a relatively straight path can be walked (optimal: 500-700m) and your testing does not have to be interrupted for other reasons (e.g. car traffic, intersection with red traffic light). Please do not take measurements inside buildings or in a zigzag course.\r\n\r\nYou should generally not perform the test if you have a severe heart or lung disease or if your health is otherwise impaired. You should also stop the 6WT if the following symptoms occur: Chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, sweating and general malaise.",

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

This App contains a 3D video which offers an overview of the process of ventilation perfusion matching, using beautiful, scientifically accurate 3D visualisation & digital story-telling. We take a look inside the human body to follow the path of air breathed in, right down to the alveolar capillaries, to see what occurs to the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) & the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) when ventilation is low or high relative to perfusion.\r\n \r\nThis 3Dme App has primarily been produced for undergraduate medical, physiotherapy, health science, nursing, pharmacology, exercise science & veterinary science students to assist their understanding of this fundamental curriculum-based topic. It is one of the core concepts which the student needs to understand if they are to successfully understand subsequent respiratory physiology concepts. This App is also suitable for the university lecturer who could “airplay” the video to their students, followed by a discussion on the Q & A. They may also choose to use the Q & A to examine their student’s level of understanding. This 3Dme App will also appeal to health professional graduates working in the field of respiratory physiology who may like to refresh their memory on the fundamentals of respiratory physiology. Additionally, a portion of proceeds from the sale of each App will be returned to Griffith University to fund ongoing innovative teaching & learning initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe video on this App was awarded a 2010 New York Global Finalist certificate.\r\n\r\n3Dme welcomes your feedback on this App via the App Store.

            "It's one if the best games I've paid. The only two things I'm concerned about is the lagging that could be because of my phone, and caused me to stop my extreme challenge, and could not rechallenge. The final thing is purchasing at least 80 worth of souljades for stamina that I did not receive, but stayed at 3 instead. Other than that this game is amazing, please help!",
            "Have been playing this game for almost a year had loads of characters and spent a huge amount of time and money on my account only to log in today after being away for a few weeks and found my entire account was deleted..... gone..... tried switching accounts figured maybe it was a mistake.... nope just got screwed.... loved this game and they ruined it for me",
            "So far, I haven't experience any crashes or the game freezing while playing. But, there's one thing that happens in the game that may be a bug. There's a chance that a character with their rage bar all the way up cannot use their ultimate. When this happens, the characters aren't silent, frozen, or etc.",
            "I have played this game a long period of time, and recently took a break from it. I tried coming back to it today and my level 60+ account was just gone. I don't know which server had my account before, but after the switch took away all the progress I struggled tooth and nail for because I'm a f2p player, I am uninstalling. It's possible to play without spending money, but you're gonna be investing a lot of your time only to struggle with a stamina system, gacha game mechanics, and p2w pains.",
            "Pretty fun for the first week, but after that it just got repetarive and boring with the farming, and most of all the characters i wanted like Neliel and Grimmjow are unobtainable and those were the characters i Downloaded this game for but to be utterly disappointed, and even if they did become available, the rarity and chances are too low and you'd have to spend a lot of money to get them. What i'm trying to say is this game is not fun if you hate being disappointed."

        "title": "Altitude Sickness: Causes,Diagnosis, and Treatment",
        "description": "Altitude sickness, the mildest form being acute mountain sickness (AMS), is the negative health effect of high altitude, caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation. Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, feeling tired, trouble sleeping, and dizziness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion. Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude. \r\nAltitude sickness typically only occurs above 2,500 metres (8,000 ft), though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities. \r\nPrevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres (1,000 ft) per day. Being physical fit does not decrease the risk. Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids. Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen, acetazolamide, or dexamethasone. Severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible. Treatment efforts, however, have not been well studied. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Altitude Sickness symptoms, Altitude Sickness management, Altitude Sickness causes, Altitude Sickness diagnosis, Altitude Sickness Prognosis, Altitude Sickness Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Altitude Sickness apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "This application is a must for medicine student, resident, researchers doctors  and surgery  professionals. \r\n\r\nThis app contains 2272 Medical terms and words sorted by medicine fields.\r\n\r\nThis app contains the following sections:\r\nSection #1=\"Preffixes, Suffixes, Single & Plural Forms\",\r\nsection #2=\"Combining Forms\",\r\nsection #3=\"Basic Elements of a Medical Word\",\r\nsection #4=\"Body Structure Terminology\",\r\nsection #5=\"Integrementary System Terminology\",\r\nsection #6=\"Musculoskeletal System terminology\",\r\nsection #7=\"Cardiovascular  System Terminology\",\r\nsection #8=\"Blood & Lymphatic & Immune System\",\r\nsection #9=\"Respiratory System Terminology\",\r\nsection #10=\"Digestive System \",\r\nsection #11=\"Urinary System \",\r\nsection #12=\"Reproductive System \",\r\nsection #13=\"Endocrine System \",\r\nsection #14=\"Nervous System \",\r\nsection #15=\"Eyes & Ears y\",\r\nsection #16=\"Special Topics Terminology\",\r\nsection #17=\"Medical Terminology Exam\",\r\nsection #18=\"Terms You Have to Know\",\r\nsection #19=\"\"Dentistry Glossary\"\r\nsection #20=\"Pharmacology encyclopedia\",\r\nsection #21=\"Obstetrics & gynecology concepts\",\r\nsection #22=\"Oncology terms\",\r\n\r\nThis app is also suitable for United States Medical Licensing Examination ® USMLE & icensed practical nurse (LPN) candidates.\r\nMedical terminology is language that is used to accurately describe the human body and associated components, conditions, processes and procedures in a science-based manner. Some examples are: R.I.C.E., trapezius, and latissimus dorsi. It is to be used in the medical and nursing fields. This systematic approach to word building and term comprehension is based on the concept of: (1) word roots, (2) prefixes, and (3) suffixes. The 'rootword' is a term derived from a source language such as Greek or Latin and usually describes a body part. The prefix can be added in front of the term to modify the word root by giving additional information about the location of an organ, the number of parts, or time involved. Suffixes are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.\r\n\r\nIn the process of creating medical terminology, certain rules of language apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called linguistics. So, when a term is developed, some logical process is applied. The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a combining form. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter -o-, added to the word root.\r\n\r\nPrefixes do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an in- may change to im- or syn- to sym-.\r\n\r\nSuffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel.\r\n\r\nDecoding the medical term is an important process, (See: Morphology). Once experience is gained in the process of forming and decoding medical terminology, the process becomes easier. One approach involves breaking down the word by evaluating the meaning of the suffix first, then prefix, and finally the word root. This will generally produce a good result for the experienced health care professional. When in doubt, the result should be verified by a medical terminology dictionary.

Some examples are: R.I.C.E., trapezius, and latissimus dorsi. It is to be used in the medical and nursing fields. This systematic approach to word building and term comprehension is based on the concept of: (1) word roots, (2) prefixes, and (3) suffixes. The &#39;rootword&#39; is a term derived from a source language such as Greek or Latin and usually describes a body part. The prefix can be added in front of the term to modify the word root by giving additional information about the location of an organ, the number of parts, or time involved. Suffixes are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.<br><br>In the process of creating medical terminology, certain rules of language apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called linguistics. So, when a term is developed, some logical process is applied. The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a combining form. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter -o-, added to the word root.<br><br>Prefixes do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an in- may change to im- or syn- to sym-.<br><br>Suffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel.<br><br>Decoding the medical term is an important process, (See: Morphology). Once experience is gained in the process of forming and decoding medical terminology, the process becomes easier. One approach involves breaking down the word by evaluating the meaning of the suffix first, then prefix, and finally the word root. This will generally produce a good result for the experienced health care professional. When in doubt, the result should be verified by a medical terminology dictionary. The process of learning any new language, such as medical terminology, is facilitated by learning basic rules.<br><br><br><br>The use of a medical dictionary or Internet search engine is most helpful in learning the exact meaning of a medical term. However, if the basic concepts of word building are understood, many words are understandable to the student of medical terminology.",

I constantly viewed the ads to get the rewards but now it's just plain infuriatingly irritating. Still a great game but latest update bombards you with so many ads it completely spoils the gameplay and flow of the game. Sorry, I'm out.",

One setting that they also remembered with these type of games with lots of flying and enemies and exploding etc, is the the one to give you a choice if you want to play with High, medium or low graphic settings. That gives you a 1 in 3 chance to play the game and not like others force you too and then its sluggish and glitchy. Well done devs. Great game."

This routine is designed to give a you a mini-vacation. With continued practice, you’ll find yourself more relaxed, more resourceful, feeling lighter, and able to go with the flow.\r\nThe opposite of flow is stress and anxiety. If you are feeling anxiety in your life, you aren’t alone. Anxiety is one of the most common problems people face today. Qi Gong is a quick and easy solution to anxiety that comes from the inside out.\r\nThere’s a saying in Qi Gong, “Let your mind be clear like a mountain lake: reflective, free and open.” This routine will help you find that equanimity, where the body is relaxed\r\nand the mind at peace. Join Qi Gong teacher and PBS favorite, Lee Holden, in this simple and easy to follow routine.\r\n•\tTransform anxiety into inner peace with moving meditations\r\n•\tClear anxiety using simple breathing exercises\r\n•\tRelease tension and stress with gentle stretching\r\n•\tBalance the nervous system with long, flowing movements\r\n\r\nQi-Gong means \"energy-work\". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n      \r\n    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called \"acupuncture without needles.\" \r\n     \r\n    Similar to yoga, Qigong can stimulate the entire body deeply with low-impact movement and develop a stronger mind/body connection. The slow, relaxed movements are widely recognized for their health benefits, such as boosting your immune response, strengthening the internal organs, muscles, joints, spine, and bones, and developing abundant energy. A Qigong session makes one feel strong, centered, and happy. \r\n     \r\nQigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading our free app!

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire.

Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "It's a really good game in my opinion. I love all the song choices and the story. The art is really cute too. I never knew that a music game would make me so happy and emotional. I really love some songs like \"Waltz in devils playground\" and \"I hate to tell you\" although, love all of the songs. I would tell other people to play this. I'm so happy this game was made. Thanks for all the hard working people who helped make this game. Also, thank you Rayark for making this lovely game.",
            "This game is incredible. By far my favourite game of its kind due to the high quality unique music, the stunning visuals and art, and the always compelling storyline. I've been playing Deemo since I first started college four years ago and have been playing it since. I listen to the music regularly, have been inspired to learn some of the songs on piano because of this game, and is in general a relaxing and fun game to play when I'm bored. By far one of the best apps I have on my phone. Period.",
            "Simple story, but the way it is told is superb. Just by the way the story is told, it's easily one of the best, if not the best rhythm game of all time. Not to mention how the soundtrack and bgm are well thought out, and fits the player's mood perfectly. The ending moved me so much I cried. Still get a heartache along with teary eyes every time I hear that one song. It's so good that it ruined my experience of other rhythm games as I can't help but find them lacking in comparison.",
            "My first DEDICATED rhythm game, and it slowly is teaching me, a beginner, to properly play and doesn't punish me for missing notes! Each and every one of the music is unique and has meaning. The story is told in a beautiful but short cutscenes, allowing us to piece the puzzle of the story together. I love it and I hope others will too!",
            "So, after few months after my last review which unfortunately was a 1 star, I can give this 5 stars again, my purchases came back and I can play again. If you like rhythm games this is the best mobile one out there. Great sound tracks, amazing challenge but with an easy start for beginners. Honestly you can't go wrong with this game."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

        "description": "Hi, I'm Zilla. Your fiery friend for a better, longer life. We're building your one app for Healthy Habits. Use the app to measure your Heart Rate and HRV, track your Stress & Recovery, and build Healthy Habits like Intermittent Fasting, Breathing Exercise, and Mindfulness Meditation.\r\n\r\nCAMERA HEART RATE MONITOR, NO WEARABLE NEEDED!\r\nHealthzilla can now monitor your Resting Heart Rate (\"RHR\") and Heart Rate Variability (\"HRV\") using your phone's camera. It takes just 60 seconds, and will measure your RHR (heart health) and HRV (stress & recovery) just like a wearable device. Do the Stress Scan every morning before getting out of bed for best results!\r\n\r\nNEW: 16-HOUR INTERMITTENT FASTING TIMER\r\nThe latest health & fitness trend is Intermittent Fasting. Use our free fasting timer to fit the ideal 16:8 fast into your day. We'll notify you once you can eat again! If you forget to set the timer in the evening, you can edit the start time to capture your fast.\r\n\r\nNEW: 10-MINUTE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TIMER\r\nThe easiest way to fit some mindfulness meditation into your day is to use our unguided meditation timer, with beautiful Tibetan gongs to help you stay focused on your meditation.\r\n\r\nNEW: 2-MINUTE RELAXING BREATHING EXERCISE\r\nIf you're feeling anxious or stressed out, take just two minutes to try our Breathing Exercise. The 1:2 ratio of inhale to exhale will activate your parasympathetic nervous system to calm you down instantly!\r\n\r\nTRACK YOUR STRESS & RECOVERY TRENDS\r\nThe dashboard shows a weekly chart of your Heart Rate and HRV data. If your Heart Rate is HIGHER than normal, it may be an indicator of higher physiological or psychological stress. Similarly, if your HRV is much lower than normal, it will indicate higher stress levels. You can use this information to guide your recovery from workouts, and generally planning your daily activities at work. For active recovery, you can also focus on sleep or add meditation and breathing exercises.\r\n\r\nDAILY STRESS SCORE\r\nAfter each Stress Scan, we calculate your Stress Score based on recent trends: Great, Good, Easy, Rest, or Sick. Use this as a guide for your daily wellness routines, activities, and workouts.\r\n\r\nANOMALY DETECTION\r\nTo help you make sense of this data, our Stress Score algorithm checks for unusually high or low values for your heart rate. Very low HRV or very high Heart Rate can be signs of acute stress, injury, or illness.\r\n\r\nFEELING UNWELL?\r\nYou can now manually override your daily Stress Score, if you're feeling stressed or unwell. You can access the override from the dashboard, or after your daily Stress Scan.\r\n\r\nRESTING HEART RATE (“RHR”)\r\nThis data is much more important than your real-time heart rate. What’s the difference? Heart Rate represents how much work your heart has to do when you’re relaxed. It’s not exactly the same as the lowest heart rate you have when you sleep.\r\n\r\nThe reason resting heart rate is important is that it’s a rough measure of your nervous system activity, hormone levels, and cardiovascular fitness. There is research to show that lower resting heart rate means longer life.\r\n\r\nHEART RATE VARIABILITY (“HRV”)\r\nOkay, so we know heart rate is your pulse. How many times the heart beats per minute. So what is this voodoo, then? Well, it turns out that the beats per minute aren’t steady. There’s a minute variation between each one. Some shorter, some longer.\r\n\r\nThis is some of the most interesting new data out there, because HRV is actually a representation of your central nervous system. If you’re not exactly sure what that is, it’s basically your wiring. How signals pass between your brain and the rest of your body. Analyzing this signal indicates if your body is in fight or flight mode, or rest and digest mode. Naturally, you wouldn’t want to unnecessarily be in fight mode which stresses out your body over time.\r\n\r\nRead our full terms of service: \r\nhttps://healthzilla.ai/terms",

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

Anatomy provides information about structure, location, and organization of different parts of the body that is needed to truly understand physiology.  Together, anatomy and physiology explain the structure and function of the different components of the human body to describe what it is and how it works.<br><br><br>Table Of Content :<br><br>1\tIntroduction to Anatomy and Physiology<br>2\tThe Chemical Building Blocks of Life<br>3\tOrganization at the Cellular Level<br>4\tOrganization at the Tissue Level<br>5\tIntegumentary System<br>6\tSkeletal System<br>7\tSkeletal System: Parts of the Skeleton<br>8\tJoints<br>9\tMuscular System<br>10\tOverview of the Nervous System<br>11\tCentral Nervous System<br>12\tPeripheral Nervous System<br>13\tSpecial Senses<br>14\tAutonomic Nervous System<br>15\tEndocrine System<br>16\tCardiovascular System: Blood<br>17\tCardiovascular System: The Heart<br>18\tCardiovascular System: Blood Vessels<br>19\tLymphatic System<br>20\tImmune System<br>21\tRespiratory System<br>22\tDigestive System<br>23\tNutrition and Metabolism<br>24\tUrinary System<br>25\tBody Fluids and Acid-Base Balance<br>26\tThe Reproductive System<br>27\tHuman Development and Pregnancy<br>28\tReproduction, Chromosomes, and Meiosis<br><br><br><br>The eBooks app features allows the user to :<br><br> Custom Fonts<br> Custom Text Size<br> Themes / Day mode / Night mode<br> Text Highlighting<br> List / Edit / Delete Highlights<br> Handle Internal and External Links<br> Portrait / Landscape<br> Reading Time Left / Pages left<br> In-App Dictionary<br> Media Overlays (Sync text rendering with audio playback)<br> TTS - Text to Speech Support<br> Book Search<br> Add Notes to a Highlight<br> Last Read Position Listener<br> Horizontal reading<br> Distraction Free Reading<br><br><br><br>Credits :<br><br>Boundless (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0))<br><br><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFolioReader%2FFolioReader-Android&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMEoT_FaxGUFopstBKcu7CPZK7eg\">FolioReader</a>,  Heberti Almeida (CodeToArt Technology)<br><br>Cover by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freepik.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkIfW4bVXc1sQujN2x2sVpp616DA\">Designed by new7ducks / Freepik</a><br><br>Pustaka Dewi, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pustakadewi.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvEBnSzHE4Uy2PsdRMg64inZKHdA\">www.pustakadewi.com</a>",

One In-App purchase to get the full contents. You’ll learn about the human Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to develop yours, including:\r\n• Understanding Human Essence  \r\n• How Chinese Define the Organs\r\n• Qi Channels (Meridians) = Qi Rivers \r\n• Qi Cavities (acupuncture points)\r\n• Qi Vessels = Qi Reservoirs \r\n• 3 Dan Tians (Elixir Fields) = energy centers\r\n• The Seven Corresponding Gates \r\n• Yin and Yang of the Human Body\r\n (Choice of English or Spanish subtitles)\r\nDrawing on over 40 years of training in Qigong and his Western scientific background in Physics and Mechanical Engineering, Dr. Yang presents a clear and fascinating explanation of his Qigong theory, and offers a simple Qigong exercise for students to begin experiencing their Qi. This program is a must for Qigong practitioners, acupuncturists, energy healers, and anyone interested in understanding exactly how and why Qigong works.\r\nIf you’ve never attended a Qigong seminar with Dr. Yang, here’s a home version you won’t want to miss!\r\nQi-Gong means \"energy-work\". Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. Some Qigong is practiced sitting or standing still, while other Qigong can be a kind of moving meditation. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n      \r\n    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called \"acupuncture without needles.\" \r\n     \r\n    Similar to yoga, Qigong can stimulate the entire body deeply with low-impact movement and develop a stronger mind/body connection. The slow, relaxed movements are widely recognized for their health benefits, such as boosting your immune response, strengthening the internal organs, muscles, joints, spine, and bones, and developing abundant energy. A Qigong session makes one feel strong, centered, and happy. \r\n     \r\nQigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.\r\nThank you for downloading our app!

I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

        "description": "There is nothing worse than having a nagging cough. Coughing can keep you up at night, interfere with your work and make you feel just plain miserable.\r\nCoughing is a natural response to irritation or a blocked airway and often accompanies allergies, colds or the flu. There are many effective home remedies for coughing in general, but it helps to know what caused a cough in the first place.\r\nA temporary block in the airway, say, from food particles accidentally entering the airway while swallowing, may make you cough hard, but it usually gets resolved pretty quickly. Bacterial and viral infections of the throat may initiate shallow, but painful coughing.

There are many effective home remedies for coughing in general, but it helps to know what caused a cough in the first place.<br>A temporary block in the airway, say, from food particles accidentally entering the airway while swallowing, may make you cough hard, but it usually gets resolved pretty quickly.

Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body's Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.\r\n\r\n    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called \"acupuncture without needles.\"\r\n\r\nQigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.\r\nThank you for downloading our app!\r\nSincerely,\r\nThe team at YMAA Publication Center, Inc.\r\n(Yang’s Martial Arts Association)\r\n\r\nCONTACT: apps@ymaa.com\r\nVISIT: www.YMAA.com\r\nWATCH: www.YouTube.com/ymaa",

Qigong (chi kung) is the ancient art of building the body&#39;s Qi (energy) to a higher level and circulating it throughout the body for rejuvenation and health. This gentle Qigong exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress, increase energy, enhance healing, and generally improve your quality of life.<br><br>    Qigong increases the quantity of energy in the body, and improves the quality of your circulation through energy pathways, known as meridians. Qigong is sometimes called &quot;acupuncture without needles.&quot;<br><br>Qigong can be effective in helping people with insomnia, stress-related disorders, depression, back pain, arthritis, high blood pressure, and problems with the immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, bioelectric circulatory system, lymphatic system, and digestive system.<br>Thank you for downloading our app!<br>Sincerely,<br>The team at YMAA Publication Center, Inc.<br>(Yang’s Martial Arts Association)<br><br>CONTACT: apps@ymaa.com<br>VISIT: www.YMAA.com<br>WATCH: www.YouTube.com/ymaa",
