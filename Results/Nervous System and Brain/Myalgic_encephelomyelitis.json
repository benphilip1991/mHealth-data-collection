Registry is a collection of patient-reported data from people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS) and healthy controls. People with ME/CFS know this disease best and have invaluable information to share based on their lived experience. You + M.E. gives patients a platform to share their share what they know about their disease with researchers.

They also use the You + M.E. mobile app to record symptoms, activity, and other factors related to their disease over time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou + M.E. mobile app users are asked to consistently report on a core set of symptoms: fatigue, brain fog, unrefreshing sleep, lightheadedness, and post-exertional malaise (PEM). Beyond the 5 core symptoms, people can self-select symptoms relevant to them for tracking in the app. There are additional screens for logging life events (e.g. socializing with family/friends), activity levels, and an overall rating of wellness. Graphing functionality within the app provides trends in easy to read, comprehensive charts that users can use to monitor their health and share with loved ones or healthcare team.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\n- Sign up for the You + M.E.

I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",

You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "I recently switched to a Samsung phone. I'm an avid tumblr user. although the app for iPhone works perfect, so far my experience here has been terrible. I can't scroll through my feed without it glitching a hundred times! Whenever I reblog I'm pushed back all the way to the top of my feed and I lose my spot. plus anywhere you touch on the screen, it will start glitch out and do the opposite of what you want to do. I've been able to make it work, but they need to fix this immediately! 👎",
            "Laggy, blurry images, and buggy. Even for just browsing, I run into problems. Reblogging anything takes you back up to the top of the page w/endless scrolling. All images are blurry and poor quality, plus there's some serious lagin loading them at times. Posting options are extremely limited and many core functions are missing. Overall it's clunky, frustrating and disappointing.",
            "the app is basically unusable. Every time you reblog a post or even so much as open an image your dashboard will refresh and scroll all the way to the most recent post. Oh you were zooming in on a photo you wanted to reblog after 10 minutes of scrolling? Too bad it's gone now! Please for the love of god fix this, I know I'm not the only one with this issue :/",
            "Please for the love of god fix the feature that skyrockets me back to the top of my dashboard every time I click on a picture, video, notes or reblog something. If you're going to have endless scrolling then maybe make sure that it doesn't lose its place every time I try and interact with a post. Sick of starting at the top and trying to scroll down to find my place again. And while I'm at it, how about fixing the video player so I can watch a 6 second vine without it buffering 10 times.",
            "I like Tumblr as a website, but this app is terrible and has been for as long as I've had a Samsung. Each update only seems to make things worse. Less convinient, more clunky to navigate, and more glitchy. My notifications have NEVER worked properly, sometimes it just sends you back to the top of your feed, and the new tagging interface is an inconvenient pain. Please get everything working properly before adding useless interface changes we have to readjust to for no reason and LESS convenience"

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "This is such a fun game to play, you can get skins , win plenty of games, and play with friends! I really love this, and the way it was made. I play all night with friends and have fun everyday! I hope it stays free and more people play it, but i have a problem. Everytime i try to move, it glitches and kills me! Please try to fix this, have a good day and thank you for visisting!",
            "As far as an .io game goes, Paper.io has always been one of my favourites. I used to play it way back when you could buy characters with coins. I'd recommend Paper.io to people who just want a simple, fun game to play in their spare time. It runs smoothly, doesn't take up a lot of storage space or battery. I personally don't invest a lot of energy in this game, but I know quite a few people who love it for both its simplicity and bordom-killing abilities.",
            "Paper io. was extremely good last time. Now it's extremely frustrating. Many ppl say that it's difficult to control, and it's only about your own skill and understanding of the game. But the challenges are extremely horrible now. They take a long time to load on this same device (OPPO R9) and it is very laggy when playing the challenges, causing me to crash into walls very often. The normal mode runs so smoothly, why can't the challenges do the same? Please get this fixed.",
            "The game used to be fun, but now the controls suck! It used to be so smooth where you could just glide across. But now it's 90° degree angle turns and hard to control. It was also a lot less complicated. Please make it go back to being smooth.",
            "This game is actually crazy I just wanna say that this is for those who have extra time and they get bored but if they want to play this game they can enjoy, but the worst thing is that if you die in this game you will be very angry, but some have just broked there phones because of that anger"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "I did an update last night causing me to lose lives I had stored up, gold bars and even though I beat level 734 over 6 times it will not let me move past. On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",
            "I've been playing ALL the Bubble Witches for years now and I COMPLETELY fell in love with all of them! 🥰 I have a panic disorder and these games help so much to soothe my anxieties and let me focus on the fun! I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",

I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",

The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

Still not allowing me in! Have emailed the one given on this page and no response.",

Update: I keep getting red flagged and keep getting asked to verify over and over again even though I had several times. This is so stupid. Update again: they won't let me come back in! Saying I need to change passwords but they won't let me! Horrible site. I'm deleting forever and telling others to never use this site.",

I have already proved I'm one hundred percent real but this time I am trying to verify no matter what I do it's not letting me. I don't want to lose my account because I have many people I talk with. Ridiculous. The biometric is stupid and should be updated.",

I've been asked to verify twice in one week. The most recent time I was verified by picture then it asked me to change my password. Problem is I signed up with Facebook and therefore do not use a password to log in. I emailed a few times trying to resolve this issue and still am locked out.",

I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",

If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",

Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "Game is quite good but so many ads! I got to level 17 and uninstalled, only because after every two levels you are being forced to watch an ad. Considering that the first levels are very easy and only take 2-3 seconds to solve each of them, basically after 10-15 seconds of playing you have to watch 30-35 seconds ads, and you can't skip or go back to the home menu, unless you quit the game. I understand that it is a free game and you rely on ads for your income, but man! Let us play a little bit!",
            "I'm getting use to it and I really do love the game that I will keep playing it. You better fix the bug in this game I get to playing then it comes up with a white circle that goes around and I half to turn my Phone off to star it again so please fix it. Thankyou",
            "An absolute fun puzzle game!This game is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played,plus I don't have to worry about ads because i could just turn off my wifi on my tablet!Absolutely love it!",
            "I got hooked as soon as I started playing! I love the style, the puzzles are progressively more challenging but in a gradual way. I wish the developers spent more time optimizing the game for modern screens, the hole-punch cutout on my screen makes the game render with a large black bar instead of a simple fill around the hole. Also, since I've paid for an ad-free experience, I would expect the notification in the corner to watch an ad go away, but they're still there",
            "more ad than game. continual ads. ads on the screen when you play, ads between each puzzle, ads, ads, ads. neat concept, but experience is ruining by continual ads EVERYWHERE."

            "This app can clean junk files and find duplicate files, so they can be deleted (cleaned). It also can find any large files that are taking up allot of space, then you can select the large files that you don't want to keep, so they can be removed. I've only used this app a few times, so if there are any other features that I overlooked, then I probably haven't encountered them yet.",
            "Earlier I requested to reduce the text size and you did it. Thanks a lot, now it is looking very good. I have one more suggestion/request. It shows, for example in my phone, out of \"64 GB\", 20 GB used. But in 64 GB some space are reserved, as we know, so it is quite difficult for me to analyze what actual space I used out of the free space. It should show something like out of 43 GB free space that has been given to user, I have used 20 GB. I hope you understand what I am trying to say.",
            "I love that this app finds your duplicate files, however there is not enough information provided. What does the little white tag in the corner of the photo mean? After you click delete a message asks-do you want to delete all versions of downloaded files? (4) What? Why? I selected more than 4 photos. Which ones are these? Did I select all versions? Then, NO. But your only choice is yes (recommended) or cancel which goes back to the previous screen, thereby blocking the delete function. SCARY!",
            "Like many of the Google apps, this one is both helpful and annoying. It is helpful to have an app that makes it easier to clean up my phone and get rid of unneeded files to free up space. On the other hand, it's annoying that it always wants to delete my downloaded pictures, music, etc., that I really want to keep on my phone.",
            "I have always loved Google files. A lot of times you think you have cleared out a lot of junk. But then you think to see what files may say. And you are surprised to see that you missed some. Great gift you get even more free space. THANK YOU again Google! Edited, I just got a new phone and files was one of the first appt I downloaded. It is still a must have.🤗 Edit. 10/26/20 I just wanted to repeat everything I said already. Especially for my Lenovo Chromebook Duet Google Files is the best."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them.

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

They we're just letting me know about Tom's Place. It's really good too. Kinda slow at times but it's not bad. I would definitely recommend 😊 this app.",

To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "Hello I enjoy the app and feel it is one of the best out here. However, I would love to see the simple features of being able to: 1. Set the back ground image to an image of my own choosing like you can on Android phone's home screen or lock screen.  2. Allow you to like someone's text in a group chat.  3.  Allow you to add an remove ppl from group chats without having to create a new group.  Thanks",
            "Years after my last review, I still use this app daily. This really is the best messaging app out there. Still doesn't support sending videos, for some weird reason, but it's a solid app, backs up messages directly to the Android message store, allows you to customize the background, foreground, text bubbles, even the app icon. If you're one of those people whose default messenger doesn't let you send you send full-sized images, Textra is the only one I've found that lets me do this.",
            "Textra is the ONLY messenging app I will ever use! It's easy to use. You can customize EVERYTHING. Like the colors you use for every contact. You can set up Textra exactly how YOU want it to be. You can change the ring tones for every contact. There are 3 types of emojis you can use. I use IOS even though I have an Android phone. If you have an idea that you think might make Textra better, send them your idea and they may use it. If you need support-it's there. I love, love, love it!",
            "I have been using textra for years, always loved it, but here within the past day or so, chat heads are now popping up for new message notifications while I'm currently in the middle of messaging someone else. When you click to open the chat head it doesn't allow you to do anything, so you have to drag it to bottom to close it. Please how do I disable this feature, it's unpleasant and unwelcomed.",
            "When switching phones I ended up having trouble sending mms messages. When Textra support was contacted they were prompt in answering and emailed back and forth with me to try and fix the problem. Ultimately it was the cell providers/SIM card that was causing the issue. I have used the app for many years and on several different phones. I will continue to use this app and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for the help and a great app. Special thanx to Mandy and Max👍👍"

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "Great! Perfectly useful for local weather situations. As well as, checking the weather all over the world. I personally, use it to warn my friends in the Philippines, when Typhoons are coming (which happens all the time). I live on the opposite side of Earth in New England USA. If it's noon here, it's the following midnight there. Exactly opposite side of Earth.",
            "This app has improved so much, especially as of lately. I gave it 5 stars initially but then noticed issues of it not having completely accurate weather in a timely manner, at least in my area. But it's been really great as of late & I use it several times a day for my city as well as my dad's city. Thank you for the improvements, very much appreciated.",
            "A terrific app, easy to navigate, it's like someone actually designed an app that knows what a human want to see or find. Simple, swipe up/down or across. I like hourly detail, this app shows initial detail at a glance, slide up, you have hourly. Some apps you have to slide all damn near to the bottom. Not this app, they're labeled at the top. Simply put, great app.",
            "great app for the most part, although it does take time to much time to load in my opinion , it would be great if this app gave the pollen count I rate this app @ 3 because of these issues; The radar hangs up( freeze up ) while selecting the layers exp; wind speed; clouds etc; Other these small issues this app is great; I would like to see the cloud ceiling measurement as other weather apps have",
            "Most accurate, user friendly weather app I've used to date. The adsi find reasonable and alerts are all in fair timing. I especially like the FYI tidbits at opening, but they can be turned off if you choose. Only reason for not giving 5*is because on occasion the discussion tab is a little more distant than I consider \"local weather.\""

            "Its a good app, but lately i have been getting spam notification from russian email account. These notifications come to mobile with a document containing a link. sometimes i accidentally click on them. I had to install an antivirus and also resort to better security for all devices in the network because of this. I also see this issue been reported to you guys, please advice on how to be safe on this matter.",
            "Can't upload any file. Tried using mobile data as well as wifi. It shows preparing to upload and an animated icon. Nothing got uploaded. I am facing no issues when using laptop to upload the same file... I tried resetting app data and cache, still no change. I recommend checking your app first and then respond. Same issues were happening with my brother's phone and the files were uploaded after an hour. Unlike him I am not having the time nor patience. I have high speed broadbanconnection.",
            "Total mess. 1. When uploading things to the drive, I used to get a black arrow pointing upwards in my notifications to indicate that the upload was complete. Now, I have to manually go in and check to see if the upload has been completed. 2. Many uploads, for reasons which can only be down to the app, are not uploading completely and failing. The thing is you never know until after think you have saved space in your phone and deleted the item.",
            "Upload from phone won't work. So hit and miss most of the time and often can't upload. Very frustrating. Edit: responding to Google LLC, I am using the app. On my phone. And I have tried incognito and the browser. Also how is a different network a solution? What am I supposed to do? Change my mobile service provider in order to use this app? I've paid for extra storage and honestly think this is a terrible app. I'd give it no stars at this point I'm so frustrated with it . :(",
            "This app is so disappointing..... immediately I installed it, I tried uploading a file on there...it just didn't work, I tried multiple times but still nothing. It was like a complete waste of my time and WiFi. I still haven't been able to make use of it. So I'll definitely uninstall it soon because it's simply..only clugging my phone memory."

Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",
            "Really an amazing game. I've never found a game that's better than minecraft! I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",
            "I love this app. I have played it for many years but recently it hasn't been working. Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

Don't download load it I didn't read the review and its lame that you have to put in Facebook and gmail in order to meet with people then the other problem is that if you haven't log in your phone number and want to unlink the websites you have to add the number in order to unlink it. DO NOT INSTALL. if you don't believe me and other people experience it yourself.",

            "Its a good app just needs to improve more and they should think of some advantages for the senders as the senders invest huge amounts in the app",
            "Do not download. The layout is confusing, invasive, and refuses to respond through their customer service email when they have no option to permanently delete unless you want to link Facebook, google, and your phone number. I didn't read the reviews and tried on a whim. Seriously, don't install it. If there were such a thing as negative stars or turds, this app deserve the lot of those. Has anyone successfully deleted their account from there?",
            "Tiktok is BY FAR better. I spent 4 hours trying to figure out this app, and customer service did NOT help. The app DOES have potential, but the problem right now is, there needs to be an entire rescripting of the English version of this app. User guidelines are vague and not well written. FAQ does not hold enough information. The 24-7 customer service bot is all AI and there is no actual person, unless they give you an email.. which I am still waiting for.. App is fun, but still needs work."

Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",

I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

            "Don't, just don't. I got into the 4400's for my level, so I played this quite a bit. They even got me to shell out money for the events a couple of times, which no other game managed. 500 characters isn't enough to fully explain why this isn't worth your time. And when I post this,if I get a reply from the company, it will be an insincere copy-paste that screams minimal effort for maximum money grab. You will spend less money if you just buy a mobile game. Also, the deceitful ads are a thing.",
            "Same matching game it always has been. They REALLY need to stop advertising it as a different game. They even went through the trouble of adding an initial level thats like the advertisements and then it goes back to matching gems....they could EASILY create the same style of game with different ways to earn the energy you need to complete tasks. I would love to see them develop a similar game with a play style similar to the click-bait ads they create.",
            "Started off as a very good game, but at level 64 it has become impossible to advance without spending money. Very poor as it reels you in then basically the only way to advance is to spend spend spend. Have tried over 80 times and its the same outcome because you don't have enough turns to complete the level. IF the developers respond I guarantee it will the same stock answer they all use. Very poor indeed. Have now uninstalled.",
            "When you reach a certain level, you are mandated to play a Tournament of Champions. You cannot play the regular game. So if you are in the middle of a game and the game expires before the tournament is over, you loose your points and potential winnings. Some people paid to get coins to play these games which is a huge waste of money. The game designers should either be ashamed of themselves or be sued.",
            "Such a great game. What I like the most about this is that it does not have ads. Not even a single ad since the day I first played it. Such a nice game. Playrix company always make great games. So, this was all its praise. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is that the levels are too hard. Hey hey hey! But not every level. I mean 2/5. And it is specially mentioned there that the levels are going to be difficult. But we can clear the levels by using power ups. This was all my suggestion. Bye."

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

We update every week, so keep checking this space for new features and other nifty stuff. <br>  <br>New and Not-so Noticeable:  <br>- Many bug fixes, plus performance and stability improvements. ",
        "comments": [
            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "Very confusing. Every time I try to login I have to change my password. Takes me forever to accomplish anything with ATT. I uninstalled this app, could not get it to let me in. Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!😠😠😡😤 OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

The app should run smoother than ever. <br><br>Plus... we added a sleep timer feature for premium users!

            "Best. App. EVER!! Its amazing! Sure you cant download as many songs as you want, but they are just making buisness! Furthermore, its just great and I am listining to it as I am writing this. I can't think of a better app, spotify is way too expensive as I am a kid. But this here is just an amazing legend. It gets my 5 stars. (It deserves infinite stars though)",
            "I really hate the fact that you know have to upgrade to premium to download as much songs as you want, it really sucks, I've had this app since 2017 when you didn't have to be premium, kinda sucks now you have a limited amount of songs you can download. Also adds are getting worse and worse, need to fix that",
            "audiomack is usually a 5star App ...However, this new upgrade which only allows you to download a certain amount of premiums downloads before forcing an upgrade .... which once was free causing my rating to be as is... i am a long time customer and once im able to download an unlimited amount of download w\\o seeing certain songs being characterized as premiums my rating will increase significantly!!!!!",
            "If I'm being honest. Don't understand the complaints. The app devs need the money that they get for premium, limiting the offline Playlist to 20 isn't bad because you can still have an online one. You just need internet to play the songs and most people have data so I don't see the big deal. The app is good, you find new artist, remix and really anything you want. The staff is monitoring the app constantly from what I've seen and overall just works as a good music streaming app.",
            "First. Anybody on this app that is looking for a Apple music replacement is lame; thats why excluscivity has a fee. Second, if you use Live Mixtapes but are tired of the lack of currensy, this is the type of release access you need. Finally, I use more Audiomack than the LiveMixtapes App, the Apple Music app, because apple is...corporate. Eventually they'll pick it up but Audiomack to me is still getting the links to the streets. Like that Zayetoven release, i cant find it anywhere. Thank you."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",

If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Good game if a bit boring. My main problem is that the yellow balls with stripes look like money from far away. Quite a simple problem and can be fixed easily. Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",
            "LOVE THIIIIIIISSSSSS but there is lots of lagging I have a good quality phone because its lagging it's weird but it's the game. Worth playing very fun and can get a little boring.",
            "Difficult, but extremely fun at the same time. If people are complaining about ads, then turn your WiFi/mobile data off. 5/5"

            "It is very good, there is good editing in it, it is available for free in everyone's phone and it also looks good editing the normal photo, but it really takes backup so I liked it This is a gallery, it is very good to save photos and it also has edits, it really keeps updating, so keep updating it, then you get to see new features and I like it too That is why I did not force stop it and I am using it, I would give it 5 stars but due to the lack of any more good features, I will start it only 3",
            "I really can't say that I love the way this app works. It's not at all intutitive. There's such a disconnect between my sd card and my photos on my phone when I'm in the photos app.. I don't really get why this has to be so difficult? It'd be nice if every pic or video the phone has access to (on device or on sd card or in other apps, etc) would just come up when I go into the photos or gallery app. It's like a mystery I have to solve any time I'm trying to work with this app! Thx.",
            "This update is the absolute worst. No longer are the folders small, easy to navigate single pics, but now the first dozen photos from each folder, filling the entire screen, with a tiny label... I can't just tap a pic to open the folder, now I have to scroll through pages to find the folder I'm looking for - plus, other than \"camera,\" everytime I open \"Photos,\" the folders are going n random order - and there's no way to alter or customize the view. Thanks for making garbage! 👍",
            "mostly positive. i like that it keeps my photos on the cloud and that i can use google apps to switch info from phone to phone. but my pixel 3 had an issue with this app where it restarted randomly as i was backing a LOT of stuff up to the cloud and about a 3rd of the photos were corrupted when it started back up again, even on the cloud, even on my phone. also, it says in the description of the app that you can upload unlimited photos and videos for free but you really only get 15 gb",
            "Good. But we need an option where you can manually set some photos to be saved in full resolution and the rest in high quality (free tier). So that the pictures that the user don't want it compressed can be availed in full resolution but the other pictures can be compressed and saved in free tier without using up the GBs allocated to and account. Right now the entire gallery gets uploaded on full resolution, when you change the mode."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "Ive been using Pandora for three years, and lately I've been having issues. Whenever I choose a specific song on my playlist it doesnt play it and ends up playing a different song on my playlist. I updated it and everything, and it still hasnt been fixed. I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "This has been bothering me for so many times already. i mean, who would like to be verified multiple times when they've already done it once?!?!? twitter keeps asking me to verify myself to prove that i'm not a bot, so i did. then Twitter asks me again. Honestly its annoying, shouldn't once be enough already? now i can't even get into my account cause they're asking for my phone number, and it says that its unsupported, which doesn't make sense cause thats what i've been using 4 making accs..",
            "For the new update, when my list is pinned to my home page, if I scroll through my list and look at a video or picture, when I exit out of the full screen I'm immediately sent up to the very top of the page. It doesn't go back to the tweet I was looking at. Can you please fix it everything was working fine before :)",
            "It's been working fine until I couldn't post tweets as fast as before. Thought it was because of the connection or it just needs an update but no, it took forever before it worked properly. It gave me a scare cause suddenly it wouldn't load the interface, I even thought I was hacked. Please make an announcement if you had a downtime, outage etc.",
            "As many have already pointed out and subsequently ignored by the devs, the latest update is a complete disaster. Everything has slowed down to a crawl, it's laggy, notifications don't work and there is no transparency in what exactly is changed or improved with each download just \"bugfixes\" they write, who knows what stuff they are secretly adding or doing that effects your private things. Heavily Disappointed. Fix this please and reply to the users instead of ignoring them.",

Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time",
            "Its actually relaxing. I see everyone commenting about the difficulty. It happens, but too me that's the point. Why would anyone want too play an easy game. I like my mind being massaged and 4 that reason, I will never quit. I'm on level 1850 something. I lost count. Lol. I do agree at times with winning more, but at other times because of my consistency, I get rewarded a lot of boosters too stay in the game. Use them wisely. Create your own strategy and you'll get ahead. Good luck everyone!",
            "Actually pretty fun. Glad I finally tried it after being bombarded with ads. Still don't know how they monetize this game...I've played as much as I want without being prompted to pay for anything. Graphics good even if storyline is a bit corny. UPDATE: ok...NOW I know how they make coin! They get some $10/month or so from me now. I'm hooked & too often stay up far too late \"just to win one more time.\" The deals can be pretty fair though, and I'd like to think playing keeps dementia at bay :)",
            "You know if you wanna win, you gotta have some tricks.. I'm sorry Gardenscapes, but I have to help them folks... Tricks to beat some level... 1. If you had played for several weeks but can't move up a level, try not to log in for a few days... After that long period, try logging in, and see what Austin have in store for you.. I mean, free gift... 😅 2. Try to create as many boosters as you can then if you're lucky those boosters might sit next to each other then you can make a huge blast!",
            "Fun game. If you want to burn some time, it's not bad. A puzzle game with quests. You literally advance to harder puzzles by doing quests. Still playing after 800 levels. It gets harder and you will need more specials like bombs and rainbow wheels to get past the Super Hard levels or you will start to get frustrated as you will need luck on these maps more so than skill."

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",
            "Love it! Been playing over 2 years, lol... and I'm on level 2,433! It's very addicting. I love playing it when I'm bored and in my breaks at work. I also like how they change things up and the bonus levels! Keep up the good work!",

No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

Half the time when I press a button or attempt to load something, the app just gives up. This includes trying to upload directly from giphy to another site, such as Instagram. This app only works once in a blue moon on the 13th day of every other month.",
            "Very excited to use the app since every article online recommended it. Well, I downloaded it twice, uploaded my own gif and when I try to share it with Instagram all I get is a green bar that says posting to Instagram amd nothing happens. I tried probably 10 times before giving up.",
            "Saving a gif to my device and opening it so it could save to my gallery revealed the worst quality I've ever seen anything on my phone. The effects available are.. whatever. The app in general is ok, haven't ran into any issues.",
            "this is my absolute favorite giph app,only problem is that it used to be an option on facebook messenger and now its gone,i downloaded from the app store but have no idea how to connect it to any other app so that it is easily accessible,so if i want to use it i have to go back and foudth and in and out of it and other apps to use it ,im a huge giph person and cuz of this reason i hardly ever use it,but wish it was easier cuz it is one of,if not the best gif making app,",
            "You can't paste a link to create a gif from a YouTube video? If it's possible, I can't find it. :( Edit: I deleted the app. It kept freezing up, there was no intuitive way to adjust the font style or size, & it would sometimes just go dark. This has to be some kind of platform glitch (Android) bc I can't imagine giphy being this lazy!"

It can also just be fun and silly. It all depends on what you're looking for. I only have one real complaint and it's that I wish you had more characters to write a comment with. I'm an extremely long winded person and the limit makes it feel difficult to communicate efficiently for me. I haven't had the app for very long though. 🤷🏾‍♀",
            "This app is amazing !!! It keeps you very entertained and you can spend hours on it without being bored , but there are lots of problems , minor problems and big problems. A big problem for example would be Tik Tok deleting random videos which really annoys me , some of my favourite videos have been deleted for no reason , and another huge issue is the community , the people in the comments always say mean stuff to the creators of that video and it really bugs me because I feel so bad for them.",
            "I really enjoy the app, very much, but there are a couple/few of things I would love to see updated: *1. Make it possible to edit a video after posting (too many times I have made a last minute change, which (for whatever reason) changed the placement of an embedded text. SO IRRITATING); *2. While in the editing process, make it so the timing duration doesn't disappear; *3. Disclose how one can become \"verified\" (this actually may be in the app somewhere, but I haven't been able to locate it);",
            "I love tiktok. But sometimes the app freezes and its sorta annoying. And why should we have to link our phone number? I can't text like that. And we should be able to have multiple accounts with the same phone number. I know that could be dangerous but you could notify the other account(s) with the same number to see if it is the same person. And until this is fixed I will rate one less star every month.",
            "I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."

            "It's great and I'm surprised it's better than I expected it to be, honestly. But... There's a problem when logging in. I have 5G and full service and a good processor in my phone, and it runs slow when trying to connect when starting up. So it's not my phone, because fortnite runs just fine and I assumed it would give me a lot of problems. But the initial start up is what's troublesome, other than that, great game.",
            "This game is fabulous however there are some problems associated with it which are needed to be fixed in order to make it better. Firstly, its greatest problem is that we enter in those MP matches which have already started, this squeezes all the fun out while playing a match, it was fine earlier but now it happens too frequently. This problem is a major setback here. And secondly, in BR matches its frame rate is a major problem, it is not as smooth as MP matches. So kindly fix this. !PEACE!",
            "The amount of content that you guys are trying push, sell, advertise is what will ultimately drive users away. Keep the design simple man. There's more menu's on this game than a PC game. Stop it. Also unbelievably huge game. It's not enough to download the game. You have to download maps, camps , weapons, modes. Just stop. I gave the game 5 stars earlier. Now it's filled with junk",
            "New updates still can't play the game. Nothing but buzz sounds and then kicks you from the game. Awful experience. Even if you wanted to play every day you can't. Don't waste your money. First experience with app was amazing. Now there is so much lag the game isn't even fun anymore. Okay haven't been able to play game because the game won't load. Just a weird noise and game shots off. Nothing but garbage!",
            "I've never experienced a mobile game so welll made as this. Truly exceptional. I think one of the greatest features of this game is that you don't need to spend money to keep up with multiplayer game play. The game rewards you for playing for free!! Which is unheard of at the level of quality this game provides IMO. I have cricket wireless, and I play about an hour and a half a day for the past week or so and I've had NO ISSUES. not only that but the game doesn't even go through that much data!"

            "Good job in fitting Excel, Word, Lens and Powerpointt in one app. The number of bugs have been greatly reduced over the past months. I'm hoping to see further integration of OneNote in the future. The user experience has been mostly smooth. Files seamlessly sync with OneDrive. Office Transfer is also a great tool built in to the app, which allows for fast media & file transfers between the phone and PC. Would recommend this app 100%.",
            "This app is quite better than WPS Office. However, Office Suite has better visuals and accessibility. Plus, it does not show whether the file was saved or not. And it doesn't have the discard option when you don't want to save a document. Tapping on texts zooms in and out and doesn't point to where I want to type. The app also occupies too much storage in my device. (500 Mb).",
            "Very helpful app. Word, excel, PowerPoint all under one umbrella. But has some bugs to fix. When I use app for some 5 minutes the app exit itself and I want to start from the beginning. This usually happens when I use word, or lens for some time. So please fix this. Or please add a auto save feature. And I can't find a scroll button in the .ppt files. So please add this. So I can scroll down slides very fast when I am not in slideshow.",
            "This Office application will not work properly after only a few days of use. I am unable to open this Office app on my Samsung Chromebook. The app opens for only a few seconds, then closes without notice. I have tried uninstalling the app, then reinstalling the app, but this action did not correct the issue. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing due to my reliance on this app to complete undergraduate coursework in Office type documents. I am unable to retrieve my documents.",
            "Impossible To Keep Same \"Theme Font\". I'm typing up songs I write. It keeps changing the Font of every single word; I must go back & put in smaller font so my words fit page. I changed over from \"Docs\" as the margins are better with Office, but I may go back. Office keeps putting a period after each Guitar chord (Letter) I write above words; Docs does same thing. Annoying. Not user friendly."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "The app opens and allows me to fill in my pre-made forms. The problem is I can't 'save as' to a different file name within the app which is stopping me from easily reusing the form. I can't even rename a file within the app! If it doesn't get resolved soon I'll have to stop my subscription. Edit: Also urgently needed is the option to 'flatten' documents so as filled in forms can't be changed by someone else later. Even free apps allow this. Now cancelled my subscription until Adobe sort this.",
            "This is useful for editing PDF files i have to edit. But there is some problems that makes it annoying to use: 1.using Fill and Sign Text sometimes undoes itself for no reason. So you must save alot of times which is annoying. 2 sometimes saving also undoes some text 3 there is no copy and paste (well you can paste but you cannot select a text to copy it.)",
            "Great extension of the powerful desktop application. The PDF ecosystem is mature and well functioning. There is just no way around Adobe if you want to get the best out of it, especially on the creation side. But seriously, make your applications faster again. They are becoming bloated and slow.",
            "Very convenient though the Adobe Acrobat I love PDFs makes it easier to print and keep on my papers without losing them except for when I have my other account I can't get into it I need all those documents you know what I can do other than that I love it no complaints here really keep up the good work",

You're taking away Hangouts which I used for txt before, so this is unacceptable to me as a solution.",

I lost years of conversations with people, and Google hasn't bothered to fix the app. This is beyond infuriating. The only restoration is to wipe my phone, use Pixel backup, still lose a week's of conversations, and then manually backup my SMS content each day.

            "Hello, Twitch Team! Thank you so much for making this App. I really enjoy watching people play games like Among Us and MTG Arena. Lately though I've been having issue while watching a stream. Sometime it would just freeze and then I'll have to close the app and open it again just so I could resume watching the stream. I know it's not that much but sometimes I miss things in the stream. My phone is kinda old. Is it possible that my phone is at fault at this one? Thank you and bless you all!",
            "Trash app lol, certain games like CSGO are full of scam streamers, which they do nothing about, and sometimes they even ban the real streamer while the fake ones keep roaming with thousands of viewers scamming people. On top of that the sound just randomly starts breaking, it just becomes robotic from nowhere on PC only way to fix it is refreshing. On top of THAT on PC the stream will randomly freeze and u have to pause and reload to make it start playing again. The only way i could solve this was with an alternateplayer. Disgraceful realy, and these issues have been going on for over a year at least, i lost count. The only reason i still watch is coz all my favorite streamers are on the platform. Everything else about the platform except the emotes and the streamer communities is absolutely terrible. On TOP of that they are trying to implement ads in the middle of the streams, amazing to get an ad when an epic moment is about to happen :). Guess i should buy amazon prime in my country which would give me 0 benefit since they dont even ship here. Guess it's time to quit or see how it goes :)",
            "Its really good and simple to understand and use, but there's one big problem. Everytime I start watching a stream there's a 30 second ad, which is really annoying since you can't skip it either. If you could either ad a skip button or put shorter ads, like 5 second ads. If you could fix this, then I'll change my rating to 5 stars :)",
            "Good app - there are a few things that could be better but overall all, if you are used to using Twitch on the pc, you know what you are getting here. I have seen some people complaining about the lack of quality options and the presence of adverts but this depends who you are watching and the ads disappear if you are stubbed so don't worry about these points.",
            "I honestly love this app, it's a great way to communicate with your favourite streamers. But I have one problem. I want to change my username but I haven't verified my email yet. so I tried to numerous times but it keeps on saying something has gone wrong. I uninstalled the app and done everything I could but it said the same thing, and I was even putting in the right email address. Please fix this if you can!! Overall this app is great 👍"

            "Used to function perfectly but for the last couple months the mobile deposit feature very rarely works. It says that the check amount doesn't match the picture and to try taking the picture again but it never resolves the error. Changing the background, light source, angle, distance and uninstall/reinstall doesn't make a difference. I've wasted so much time on this nonsense.",
            "I've always had a good experience with the app. I appreciate how Wells Fargo keeps me updated on new features, changes and privacy policy updates. I'm also not very tech savvy and the app. is very easy to navigate through and understand. Personally, especially in times like this, I'd rather do my banking from the comfort of my home, car, office instead of standing in line waiting.",
            "Great app. The easiest app I've ever used compared to the one that my credit union uses. Just point and it will do the rest for you. Other app that I've used were not as friendly and hard to take photos that I have to do it a couple of times. This app makes all the adjustments for me.",
            "On its own it's OK. Basic functions are all there but the UI and UX could use a some improvement. When compared to the banking apps of competitors, the design and layout feels a decade behind. Things that take 1 (e.g. swipe left or right) action on competitors apps take 3 on this app (e.g. tap menu, scroll to selection, select action). Not an issue if used infrequently, but the little things could get annoying if Wells Fargo was my main account.",
            "Great app. Makes online banking simple and easy to use. I have all my finances in one easy to use app. My only issue is that when I login sometimes the app doesnt recognize my password. Which is frustrating sometimes. But other than that it's a great app."

            "This game is amazing. I love the fact that you can play offline. And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "So many people say that it's way too hard to get brawlers. I think that this game is perfect and it is nicely balanced (except for amber). If people are getting brawlers once a week, then it won't be as exciting when you get a new one. I have 15k trophies and 39 brawlers. That is kinda low for my level, but other than the fact that I want a new brawler, this game is 5 stars.",
            "Lots of different and interesting characters, hampered by an unbelievably toxic community. I have had countless matches where people are sitting in the spawn, doing nothing for the entire game. Or they gather up a bunch of gems and sprint into the enemy base to hand them over. There is no way to report them, so they just keep getting away with it. And that is if you don't get matched up with your level 1 and 2 team against some level 8 opponents, who can one-shot-kill you every single time.",
            "Honestly I'd give them 5 stars but the internet connection is SO BAD!!! (At least not all the time) even when I'm in a room with full connection it still lags like crazy and I'm unable to play. However everything else is AMAZING I would definitely recommend it, it has amazing updates every month and a cool youtube channel where we can follow their development the only thing that is bothersome and prevents me from giving them a 5 stars is the lag of course.",
            "The game itself is good but the \"Brawl-o-ween\" skin challenge skin should be changed to unlimited tries because sometimes when you loose its not your fault that you loose. Also, if you handing out a free skin that \"everybody can get\" why have the 4 looses and your out? It kind of defeats the purpose of handing out the skin in the first place. The fact that im not able to get the skin is making me want to uninstall it.",
            "POOR MATCHMAKING. (Example: Teammates with low power level vs Enemies with Level 10 power level). SHOULD ADD REPORT SYSTEM. I've encountered many teammate in brawl ball just to throw the game. (They take the ball and shoot it at our goal, that would make the enemy win.) Do the developers know hoe frustating that is? AND! they will be your teammates again in the next play!! 🤬 Please don't just add more events or skins. Please add some features that would make the game better."

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

We update the game every week so don&#39;t forget to download the latest version to get all the sweet new features and levels!<br><br>New to the game? Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",
        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

Spotify is much better than that but i hate it also because it only allows 6 song skips when you dont like the type of rock songs it provides. No clue why i searched best music providers and it answered with live x live other than they had a person who works for them say it",

Otherwise very fantastic job you guys have done. keep it up. i will be honest with you. i would'nt mind paying for such an app. i use it very often.",
            "LOVE IT OMG BEST APP EVER! Edit: Now I'm giving it three stars instead of five. Why? Because now it's playing ads all the time. And it didn't do that before. I can't even close out and go back in to skip them, as it's still there!! Stop it!!!!!!",
            "Great player. I'm able to import my YT playlists, there are a minimum of ads and everything works smoothly. It would be great if the app could continue to work behind a lock screen but I understand this is something that Google prevents apps from doing. :(",
            "I love it. It's free...keeps my playlists seperate, has any version of any song I want..i.e.: I like swearing, so I type explicit after the song title in search bar, right at the top are the best dirty versions there is lol great app. Always my first download on any new electronics I get. ALWAYS.",

            "The app does lack some of the features from the version on the computer. Some of these are really annoying, especially not having title page formats. I'm trying to type a paper for my class and a nice looking title page would be great but nope, they don't have it. Another thing that's annoying is the fact there is no \"online pictures\" you can insert or even graphs. Like come on you have charts, why can't you have graphs too? Its just really annoying that they don't have the same features 😒",
            "I'd have given it a five if sth so irritating wasn't one of the main annoying drawbacks of using any Microsoft app in general. You literally cannot log back in to your account, \"supposedly\" being locked or any of the sort and you put your password over and over and it doesnt work. You follow the steps and go to the website to only get the same result and you try and try to log back in and you can't. And I HATE that about Microsoft. I hope you get this issue dealt with, I'd be utterly grateful...",
            "Absolutely love the mobile version if MS Word! It's very easy to use, works well with drop box and I love how I can continue writing and editing documents on my PC or tablet as if I hadn't been using the mobile version at all. I've had no issues whatsoever and fully recommend it.",
            "Word is a very good application software. It allows me to accomplish all of my necessary task with relative ease. The toolbars are functional and very relevant and easily accessed. My overall experience with Word Application has been very enjoyable as it allows me to accomplish All of my necessary task. Most of my difficulty with the application is due to external forces such as supernatural phenomenon interfering with my progress, hence the reason for a 4 star rating and not a full five Star!",
            "Although the app is really good and easy to use you are out of luck trying to edit any doc if you are using a 12 inch tablet. It makes no sense that I am able to edit a doc (granted basic functionality but for many enough) on a 10.5 inch tablet but on the 12 inch you can only view docs as read-only and need a 365 subscription to edit. This is also the case with PowerPoint, Excel and even the all in one Office app👎👎. Really shortsighted for Microsoft when they're so many other alternatives."

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

        "comments": [
            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

        "comments": [
            "3 stars, but with upvote. I love this app. Nothing more has to be said. The only reason you dont get 5 stars: *The app is and always has been a bit quirky neither a good or bad thing. *It's slow, gets bugged easely, and can crash without you even trying to do so. *Maybe make a survey for your users, so they can give you free feedback on what could be better or advanced. (User for more than 6 years)",
            "Most confusing app ever. They need to hire a pro UX designer because the app is a labyrinth. Select coupons seem great, but then it's a huge pain in the arse to find what you want from a store that is also accepting them. You basically will be stuck in the app forever to get $2 off. The sellers I've worked with are responsive, some products are great and others are trash. It's a new frontier.",
            "I love it. It's a great app and I cam find almost anything on here. The only problem is that many items show up on my feed that aren't even available for delivery in my country. I suggest you add a feature where we can filter out where items can be delivered to. Also the \"free shipping\" button only works for certain countries but I want to see products that have free shipping for my country. I think this needs work so that it's not misleading to customers.",
            "Pretty much has become a scam after the covid outbreak. Goods either don't arrive or arrive 8 months later (my case). App design has made it difficult to navigate, as it does with each update. Currently losing a dispute because it seemes like protection time hadn't expired, while there is no way to see protection time anymore, or I couldn't find it because it's hidden away somewhere in the awkward app design. I loved AE so much. Hope this isn't the end of you.",
            "At first glance the app looks great and probably is for people living in USA or Europe but for countries like India, even though the prices look really cheap, the shipping charges on almost all the products are double the original cost. And so the ultimate price is even more than high end products. Lots of other apps are available that dont have this issue."

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "This app can clean junk files and find duplicate files, so they can be deleted (cleaned). It also can find any large files that are taking up allot of space, then you can select the large files that you don't want to keep, so they can be removed. I've only used this app a few times, so if there are any other features that I overlooked, then I probably haven't encountered them yet.",
            "Earlier I requested to reduce the text size and you did it. Thanks a lot, now it is looking very good. I have one more suggestion/request. It shows, for example in my phone, out of \"64 GB\", 20 GB used. But in 64 GB some space are reserved, as we know, so it is quite difficult for me to analyze what actual space I used out of the free space. It should show something like out of 43 GB free space that has been given to user, I have used 20 GB. I hope you understand what I am trying to say.",
            "I love that this app finds your duplicate files, however there is not enough information provided. What does the little white tag in the corner of the photo mean? After you click delete a message asks-do you want to delete all versions of downloaded files? (4) What? Why? I selected more than 4 photos. Which ones are these? Did I select all versions? Then, NO. But your only choice is yes (recommended) or cancel which goes back to the previous screen, thereby blocking the delete function. SCARY!",
            "Like many of the Google apps, this one is both helpful and annoying. It is helpful to have an app that makes it easier to clean up my phone and get rid of unneeded files to free up space. On the other hand, it's annoying that it always wants to delete my downloaded pictures, music, etc., that I really want to keep on my phone.",
            "I have always loved Google files. A lot of times you think you have cleared out a lot of junk. But then you think to see what files may say. And you are surprised to see that you missed some. Great gift you get even more free space. THANK YOU again Google! Edited, I just got a new phone and files was one of the first appt I downloaded. It is still a must have.🤗 Edit. 10/26/20 I just wanted to repeat everything I said already. Especially for my Lenovo Chromebook Duet Google Files is the best."

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",

Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "Love Outlook! Always have! I've used other formats & platforms over the years, when working at someone else's house or office, or using equipment not my own, but nothing has ever come close to matching the complete package that is Outlook. It's extremely user friendly & even the tech-challenged can usually sort their way through pretty much any function, with relative ease. I have always used Outlook & at 55 years old, don't imagine I'll be changing anytime soon.",
            "I use this for work. There is often an extremely long delay between getting a notification for an email and actually being able to view it. The email will be instantly available in Outlook online, but can take up to 5 minutes to load in mobile. The app sends notifications for meetings 15 minutes in advance, but clearing the notification in any way just results in the app resending the notification. Oh, it does the same thing with \"meeting has ended\" notifications. Atrocious app design.",
            "On my old Samsung phone I had the outlook app and NEVER had problems with it. I have had a new phone for 2 weeks and this app has had endless problems. It freezes, it doesn't load emails, it won't send emails and every variation in between. I have followed online suggestions to clear the cache and data and yes the problem is solved for no more than 1 day. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again the problem is solved for a day and then back to having the same issues. Woeful!",
            "Whilst I love the features of Ms Outlook, the app has pitfalls. I will receive a notification of a new email, click to review said email and it will be no where to be found. Refresh, refresh, nothing! However, if I go on the desktop web version I will see everything as it is to date. ... This app defeats the purpose of having a mobile service if I always have to draw for my laptop to review emails.",
            "This version of Outlook (mobile, Android) seems appropriately scaled down to suit small screen and \"keyboard\" use and appears to have been optimised for email. Most (or maybe all?) of its original functionality is there, but some features might need a bit of hunting, until you learn how to find them. . Great to be able to use full strength email via phone, with that robust corporate look & feel that Outlook is known for."

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend 😉",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw! You must download this app !"

            "I really like the idea, the art is very nice. Everything feels natural with the controls. The one thing I DONT LIKE is that it feels like a tutorial for 29 levels and then level 30 took me by surprise. It was a fun challenge. But a steep jump in difficulty progression. Once again, a great game which deserves 5 stars, but tweaks could be made to better user experience!",
            "Would be a good game if they didn't just repeat the same puzzles over and over again, just flipping and reversing previous levels. It's dumb. Also you can't go back to previous levels you can only play the one you're on and the difficult ones come maybe once in 50 levels. Boring. And since it's a VOODOO game, you know you have to turn off your data and wifi otherwise you'll be hit with a ridiculous amount of ads... At least one after each 10 second level...",
            "Good concept, decent design, crappy execution. I think it's relaxing, and it'd be fun if the ads weren't so intrusive, it didn't constantly repeat levels, and if there was actually thought put into the puzzles. Half of the time you can't actually make any choices. You just move the ball on a track. The other half it's very random feeling. There's no ramp up in challenge. Some of the first levels are repeated much later in the game.",
            "You must work on levels. how come level 139 is as easy as level 1.. It seems its just showing up any random level and back button does not work when you are playing a level... you cannot go back to level listing. I could play this game with absolutely no mind involved. Its like drawing doodles on a blank paper. and after some time. people will just delete it out of boredome. Seems like work of someone new with game dev. well if that is the case. Keep it up. Consider players' perspective.",
            "The first time I played this game it was pretty cool good but as I played it more I realized that the levels became easier.... I hate the game now. Even though level 20 and 15 look \"hard\" their really easy so umm.... Why do people even give this five four three stars? ;-; I'm honestly disappointed well done to the people who tried and are enjoying the game. Oh and to many ads!.. the same fricking and keeps playing again (x2) So like um the ads are way to much"

            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",
            "Great game ever but it had a connection problem and more of bugs after this update please resolve it. And other thing is that we want to purchase diamonds there is no other way. And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please? Thank you.",

The other ads like goggle ads are good then unity ads... because they doesn't stop/crash my 🎮game... I hope that you will remove unity ads.. Plz reply about this.... Thank You for reading my post..."

            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "This is a frustrating app. On one hand, on one of my devices, this app is great. It runs properly, is decently clear on what everything does, and having the peace of mind that my photos are safe is nice. On the other hand, on another device, this app crashes every time I try to move photos to a different app, is slow when doing anything else, and ends up wasting my time.",
            "So far I am LOVING THIS!!! I have only just begun using OneDrive, not knowing entirely what it was to begin with. Now I look for it wherever I am. I can open ANY file from pretty much ANY device! Word, power point, excel, etc.! I find that impressive. Especially since it's Microsoft. Like, I think Google tried to do the same thing but something just doesn't feel right over there. This is where it's at. Hands down. So far I highly recommend.",
            "I don't understand what's happend with this app. It worked perfectly fine and then Samsung backup switched to using one drive and it just isn't uploading anything right, it's not uploaded and new pictures from the last month since it change apart from some pictures from a year ago. Then it's saying it can no longer back up from and SD card? There doesn't appear to be anyway to change back and it's not clear what I actually have backed up now. So disappointed.",
            "Setup trying, should be made easier. Sometimes it takes days for uploads. Amazon is good for auto uploads. Making sub- albums is nonexistent (I used to keep info on leases, rent receipts, complaints, etc. in separate albums then group them under 1 album). Even Google changed that capability. I can't deal with these egomaniacs deciding what to do with my pics.",
            "Works ok except one annoying issue. The file dates displayed appear to be the dates the file was initially created and not the date the file was modified/synced. You cannot tell if file is modified until you open and inspect it. This problem is unique to Android version. Works correctly on all other OneDrive apps on other platforms (IOS, Windows, etc)."

            "I understand that the refund is under process and will probably take 14 days to reflect into my account. I will wait for 14 days and check with the bank. However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

            "Great music app, been using it for years. The only things I'd add is being being to edit multiple songs at once and being able to edit the order of songs in an album.",
            "I enjoy all the music that was downloaded on this app. I especially like that It has a favorites. I have them all starred. Sometimes the wrong artists appear with the music choices. I am not sure how many songs this app can hold. That would be helpful, so if I need to buy a memory card for additional storage or not. I plan on having more songs downloaded. My daughter did not complain about any problems transferring music over from one phone to the next with this app. Using app for 1 year now.",
            "for about 6 years April 2014-July 2020 this was always my go to app, I recommended it to everyone. never had issues, always worked beyond great. but lately, as of July 2020, it randomly crashes. in the middle of a song it just cuts out. thought it was just a minor issue, but it keeps getting worse, as of October 22, 2020, I'm deleting it. I love the customization, and options, but I can't listen to not even 1 full song without it cutting off, went from a 5 star rating to a 2. very disappointing",
            "It Won't add songs to Playlists. On my old cell, this app worked amazingly, I loved it. Recently I had to upgrade my phone and on my new cell I can't make playlists. The app is still great, but I need to be able to add songs to playlists. Edit: I can make Playlists now, but I gotta add the individual tracks. If you try to add a whole album to a list nothing happens. Still love the app, keep it up guys",
            "I hate the software that forces users to rate an app after its initial use. Yes, given the short time I use it its functioning well but time will til. One issue that bothers me is the player only finds items save to the hard drive, which is fine, except my drive is all but fill n I'm now saving mostly to SD card. But I can't do so n still use app. A work around need to be made. That said, everything else is okay for now."

            "This has got to be the most retarded app ever. I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now I am being forced to sign up with my different number only. It asks to enter number manually apart from the suggested one but when you click on that the screen just stays like that. No other options are made available. I can't sign in to the already existing account. And also we can't disable the app when necessary. The only way to disable it is to deactivate it. This is nothing but one great retarded app.",
            "Edit: The issue has been resolved, thanks dev team. Old: I don't often write reviews, but in this case I have to. Truecaller is really great, but recently I have started having issues. The app crashes on my and my girlfriends phone. This was never an issue in the past. It is basically unusable at this point, as it crashes as soon as it starts. This has to be fixed for me to raise my rating",
            "Was a great app to begin with, I paid for an annual subscription to get rid of the ads. I want my call log to be just that, a call log. But now truecaller always has something or the other at the top to remind me of some feature. If you dismiss it, it'll be there the next time you launch the app. Also out of the blue from today the app simply refuses to work on my S9. Really considering why I paid for this !",
            "I love what they give, but I hate the constant ads. And the subscription is way too much to pay just to remove ads. If they had levels where you could pay just a little too remove ads without paying for all the premium features, I would do that. Still, I can't bring myself to get rid of it, even though the ads are irritating, because it does offer things that no one else has, and I rely on their services... Stuck.",
            "The app does not work, I can't receive my calls or sms'. It crashes upon opening. The only reason why I use the app is for the identification. Otherwise it is horrible. Hate the design, hate the fact that sms and calls are all together and now when a person calls the phone rings and goes blank. It is definitely not my phone as my colleagues are experiencing the same problem."

Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "Awesome game. Its addicting. Definitely keeps you on your days. I would like to add, although I love this game, it would be nice to receive new cards more frequently. I spend billions of coins on chests to keep receiving duplicates every time and only to receive new cards needed far and few between. I do not pay to play. I like to play within the game itself. So please fix this issue to make the game more enjoyable.",
            "This game is fun, addictive and expensive. I take issue with the amount of coin packs that I purchase back to back to get to the milestone...weather it be village, set or next spin award. Example .. between this morning and last night I purchased over 20,000 spins$$ to get 16k & I still haven't gotten to 16k. I know this is how you make your money and I am just one person. But I guarantee there are thousands of us who feel this way. I know that I will keep coming back but loosen up already!!",
            "I really like this game it's real addictive and fun to play . The only problem I have with coin master is when you get up to village 100 and higher, I think when you finish a village that high up, you should get at least a gold chest and at least 100 spins. As it is now a wooden chest and 25 spins. It should be more because it is really difficult to finish a village and it just gets worse the higher you get. Other than that I have no complaints. \"GREAT GAME\"",
            "This game is DUMB. The tutorial doesn't take you through a full level and after the 5 minute tutorial you are left to wait an hour for another spin? It doesn't explain what the levels are, what you want when your spinning or why. There are lots of pop-ups to get you to buy stuff. Very very slow and totally boring. Not sure how anyone could play long enough to want to spend money. I installed this to get points for another game for getting to level 7 village, that will take a month! Uninstalled",
            "Its getting boring. No excitment. Its one thing over and over. Viking quest is next to impossible now with the absurd cost. Enjoyed it at first now its just lose coins and the bonus wheel is rigged to the point where it gives you no rewards. Thinking of deleting game. My wife and daughters already deleted. I tried to stay and see if anything changed but sadly not. Thanks for making it fun at first."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",

Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

Disappointing really...",

At one time, they took more than 12 hours to respond only to have them de-register my number, & I've been removed from all my group chats. 2. While I was in a call in mobile & switch to a different screen, I can't go back to the call screen. I was on mute during the call. Had to text my responses to the call."

            "It's a good app, but need to be better. There is some problems with this app. My phonetic language is English but whenever I open it, it supports Bengali. It settings,it is showed that FB Lite's language is my phone's language. Another problem is it's network speed. It uses less data, this is good enough. But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",
            "My opinion about FB lite :- Mobile useres think that LITE is for only common smartphone and for those useres who have poor network. Now I am using Samsung Galaxy tripple camera phone. I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",
            "The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",
            "Good but still some bugs. Not possible to save any searches in Marketplace. Since update the search option in Marketplace doesn't work properly. When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

The only thing that needs fixing is The Voice Calls, this happens to me sometimes. I will be in a voice chat for a few minutes, or hours. Suddenly, it will stop transmitting my Voice. Other times. It will kick me out of the call completely, but discord is great overran. And it usually is ok with calls!",
            "Oh my god this update is awesome! It even removed the bug for which I put a 2 star rating. I'm really sorry developers I didn't tell you the problem, I didn't see your reply! I kept getting kicked out of Discord after talking to some friends of mine and this happened quite often. But now downloading it after a long time it seems to have been gone! You did a great job, keep it up!! This app will be a huge success :))))",
            "Very convenient for finding large communities around any subject. I love being able to talk with my friends in a small group chat, or in a large server with fun bots. The premium features are certainly worth it for anyone that spends a majority of their time within the app. However, all premium features are a monthly, or yearly payment. This is not very convenient for those who don't have a steady source of income. There should be an option to get minimum parts of premium for a single payment.",
            "Most of the times it doesn't work without headphones, however if I use it in another smartphone it does work. Something that I've experienced is that while you're in a call, it mutes or something like that, so I have to get out of the call and get in again, this \"mute\" happens while I'm not touching the phone and quitting the call is the only solution i've found",
            "Hello. Whenever I have discord open (browser or app), I completely lag out of games and my discord client, and it causes my web browser to stop responding. Without discord open, I never experience lag. Also, while in both browser or app, I'll suddenly be completely unable to speak in discord, but can hear everything that other people are saying. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm dying for a fix. I love discord, but it's been basically unusable for the last couple weeks."

You can meet new people even if it is online, play with friends and family etc. I like how the battles are challenging, but everytime I play it, it kicks me out the loading screen. I don't know how to deal with this, everytime I get back to play ML my credit score is low because of the lag. Please fix this Moontoon! :'(",
            "In the past, I had issue with the game lagging on me, but ever sice the month of October of 2020, its going very well with here and there lags. So far, things are going well, minus the loading the game but. It starts to load but completely stops when loading other players. I can always exit the app out and load it back in. But by the time you do, the game started and you are behind. It's worse when you are playing Brawl. This bug really do need to be fixed.",
            "Mobile Legends is a fun moba game that has many amazing characters, different modes and pretty good features. The game functions pretty well and has been continuously getting better thanks to the developers being active towards the community of this game. The developer also have been patching,updating and informing the community on the big events, issues and other information that need to be addressed. Overall give this game a try and see how you feel about it, but I enjoy playing this game!",
            "I use to enjoy playing with this game for 2 years but after so many updates its become annoying. I always lose my resounces even though I did not erase it from my file. I tried many tricks to fix it, but didn't works at all. The only way to fix it is to download data again. Now I'm tired of downloading it again and the only choice is to uninstall it.",
            "This game was fine, but when I play the game I always get teamed up with players who couldn't understand me. Result of it I get lose streak. You should fix this problem or make something out of it because it is very annoying. I'm from the Philippines but my teams are always from Indonesia or Mongolia. Fix this or I'm switching to League of legends: Wildrift."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "I was working perfectly until yesterday. I opened it this morning to send some stuff but the message still isn't delivered. It doesn't work on both devices i used it on. I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

            "After the pass started, the gap between the have and have not have widen. Over time this has gotten ridiculous. The matchmaking is also terrible and as a level 10 free to play player I get matched 95% with higher levels with the majority level 12 and above with maxed out units. High level balancing of units is non-existent. Level 13 golem, mega knight or barbarians and good luck with your mob units who will get one-shotted by level 13 zap. Try to defend with what? FtP? Prepare to get rolled.",
            "Not a good F2P game, in fact just an ATROCIOUS game overall. Among the worst games I have played (Brawl is another top contender). As said by many, match-making is completely unfair. Supercell had 4 years to improve the game, but fair gameplay consistently got WORSE with every update and they recently decided to WRECK Clan War (for💲💲💲WITHOUT QUESTION). Enough, I am done with this game. Your games will be remembered forever for sure, but in the form of HATE and DISDAIN. WELL DONE!!!👌",
            "I previously rated this game as 5 stars. I enjoyed free to play fun and the game. Now with the addition of season pass, you have to pay to get all the new things. And lately the match making seems really unfair as well. I'm disappointed in what used to be a great game. I could go on and on about the pay to win garbage this game has turned into but I'll give a short example here. My win percentage is not even 50% when I don't buy the pass. When I do, it's well over 50. Pretty obvious to me.",
            "I love this game and just about everything is perfect but whenever my wifi glitches it just kicks me out of a game and then I have no chance of winning There should be some sort of default win when one of the players leaves the game Apart from that, I am a level 8 and I am at 4017 trophies I do really well in some games but then the game starts putting me, A LEVEL 8, against someone who is LEVEL 13 Then they shoot my score back down again, there is no chance",
            "I began playing around 2016's summer. The game WAS nice. The game program was well balanced; matchup and cardplay, and there was no handicapped for those who would not accelerate by $. Now, its a $$$ game; the season pass (bait), improves 10fold the amount of chests; the matchup is your full counter. There are beginner lvl players with maxed lvl cards. Oh, and if you don't have a 5g mobile connection, or a 100mb fiber connection, don't try playing latter or challenges. Well done SC CR division."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",
            "This game is so best and so cute. 😘😘. But the problem is add some more toys and the main problem is they sleep very quick and add more people. That's it to improve. I would like to appreciate this game. But sorry, I will give only 4 rating because you need to improve this game with more fun. So sorry but please do improve it. The game is so awesome. I liked this game👍👍👍",
            "I love this game so much. You can buy foods,and sometimes,you need to watch add to get rewards. This app is good for children like me. Try this app now! In this app,you can buy foods for Tom and his friends. Not just that! Install this app so that you will know all the the things in here! Try this app now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This app is great! Tom and his friends are soooo cute🤩 There are many surprises to discover and endless possibilities to do! The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people more😜plaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

Trouble with Google is they want far too much information and personal details. Not going to happen. Tried to find away to get rid,sadly embedded and can't be deleted. Also just let it waste time downloading updates that will never be used . The problem being we will never own our own mobile phone ,there always will be somebody sending files to reduce battery power,apps that spy.",

It works but after a day or so right back to the same issue. I'll answer the video call but the phone continues to ring only on my end. I continue to hit Accept until it stops or I hang up and call the person back.",

So far, I'd have to say that Duo really comes through and is probably better than FaceTime. I'm sure it helps when the software fully utilizes the hardware on my Galaxy Note20 Ultra, it it doesn't disappoint. Throughout most areas of cell coverage, call quality is good and I'm amazed by the smooth and detailed video quality compared to FaceTime.",

I wish the devs would add more fun filters and more interactive options for kids. I love the screen sharing feature as well, but it would be better if you can share the audio as well, and not just the video.",

We know it's not a problem with the hardware because we've been testing and when we use WhatsApp the audio is perfect. Similarly when we use headphones plugged into the 3.5mm jack the audio on duo is perfect. Please review and let me know"

            "Overall not a terrible app. has good films and shows on it. One thing that keeps on annoying me is that every time I open the app it reminds me about the profiles feature even tho I have already set up a profile on it. Also what's with the adverts, I am already paying £10 a month I don't want adverts. I get that you are promoting your new shows but put them at the end so when I exit the show give me a recommendation for a new show to watch. I know I can skip the adverts but it's just annoying.",
            "Generally first rate. The apps weak point is with no (or a weak) WiFi signal. Then when you go to play a previously downloaded show, you may get a license error. The license errors come in groups. Connecting to WiFi doesn't fix the problem. Deleting and re-dowloading the show will fix the problem. Sometimes it fixes a group of them.",
            "Almost great. No way to rate content. Unfortunately a lot of content is not available in original language. In Switzerland we have German, French and Italian as major languages so it is hit and miss if a film or show is in a language you speak even if it was originally made in English. Bohemian Rhapsody is only available in Italian, Electric Dreams only in German. Curiously Buffy the vampire slayer is only available in English. Netflix has original plus German, French and often Italian.",
            "The good things about prime video is it is a good deal for a lot of perks. The prime video library is really good too. Now the bad things The app is buggy at times. Sometimes when I close the player it returns to episode menu but is stuck there unless I go back to homepage The video player opens in seperate window and when I'm switching applications I can't tell which prime video window to select in recent apps window. The windows app is even worse, downloads expire as soon as I download them.",
            "It's an app deserving of 5 star rating all right. But this is an updated review because I am unable to stream in full HD on my LG G8x. I've checked the phone just to be sure and it supports Widevine L1 plus all other streaming services like Netflix are able to play HD content on my phone except this app. Please fix this. It's a frustrating experience and no one is even responding to my emails or feedback"

Doesn't compketely replace the actosr face to resemble your face. Some of the clips seem like they do not change a bit. Is there a way to better the consistency of the refacing? If so, then I would give the app a 5 star rating. Thank you",

Had I paid for the full version, I could have been sleeping most of the night but I had to support the app by watching 30 second ads before each reface. 2. I get the ads but maybe not before each reface, maybe every other one. At least change the ads up a little. Most of the time you're watching the same ad like that's going to make me buy the product.

I try to think that's it's just a mistake we can't do anything about it but the glitch level is really too much. I can't handle it anymore! Pls fix it! Hero dash is much better, try to make this game like tom hero dash. And are you serious? 6 hours of waiting just for unlocking a silly vault in a game? The torture is too much. Very mad 😫😵😢👿",
            "This game is really fun and it helps me get past time. Theres just on problem. This is neither happening to me or a few people. When I try to cross over to a different neighborhood through the tunnels I some time go under the road and it lags or theres some kind of invisible wall. Anyways its probobly just my internet. It's a great app. I would say the same thing for talking tom hero dash but leave out the tunnel part. That game is fun too. And a bit better.",
            "This is an amazing app! I love how its wifi free too! Idon't have any problems with it, though, sometimes the app IS a bit glitchy, but that has only happened a few times. At the moment, i am on the second tom up! I DO have a few things you could add to this game such as double jump and add more themes like underwater. I like the under ground bits where you turn up in a whole new world like the skateboard one, in the air, the sewers and ESPECIALLY UNDER WATER!",
            "This game is so cute😊 and cool at the same time. You can get characters like Tom,Angela,Ginger,Hank&Ben that's so cool and when you are running you can even go to different worlds like the underwater world,the dessert etc. The game play run smooth when you dob't have on you're wifi or you're service. This game don't let you stay on one running bath tou can go to different parts.",
            "Very adorable and fun game! Great way to pass time! All the characters are very cute and I smile everytime I play. I love the skateboarding part!Quite a cheaper version of Subway Surfers but much much cuter. But I don't really like the controls. Please make them more sensitive, or improve them overall."

I love pretty much everything about this game! 💕💕 I saw another review yesterday when I downloaded it and it said that you go so fast that you can't see the block and then it is too late. I think that is a LIE! You could totally see the block, but this game just tests to see how fast you can life your finger. 👆👆 I HIGHLY recommend this game! 🎮🎮",
            "I'd like to give it 5 stars, but the ads, dear god! The sheer volume. If you die quickly you get to play straight away, but if you last a good while you have to watch a 30 sec ad everytime. It's like you're getting punished for getting better and performing well. I still play the game, but... my word, the ads.",
            "I can't stop playing but there are so much ads nearly after every level it's an ad!. I'm not going to pay for premium however it is an addicting game and is fun but the ads get pretty infuriating something 4 stars because I feel like it's kind of a hard situation if you can fix this i'd be delighted along with some other friends of mine who get annoyed by this problem too but it's ok I guess because this game has different challenges and levels and you can even compete so 4 stars it is fun",
            "The Gameplay is nice. BUT the multiplayer mode is fake (that means you play with AI) and that sucks. Also why would there be a premium when you can just turn off your wifi and play... You can play multiplayer without wifi. It's a nice game but the multiplayer sucks.",
            "Great game. Bad customer service. Ad version/non premium is so full of ads it's unplayable. I bought the premium but got demoted back to ad support version. Sent contacts, emails with purchase receipt. No response. I want to be reinstated to paid premium. Would be 5 stars if I got what I paid for."

Works on heavy data transfer.",

Since the starting of this week, there is a glitch for the teachers in the school that disallows them to join the meeting and sometimes even the app. I have given it Four stars cause it is very annoying and we students can't study properly. If this situation is fixed I will give it a five I swear.",

But there is this thing that I would like to request the developers to add in Teams that there should be an option to delete an entire conversation with a specific person. We have to delete every single message to vanish the whole chat. Try to add this feature also to make it work more flexibly Overall nice application.. keep it up 👍🏻🤟🏻",

I tried signing out and signing in, but that also didn't work. Whenever I click on join button, it is showing that, \"Your call dropped and we couldn't reconnect\". So, I deleted it and installed an old problem free version. Edited : Now there is no problem after updating to the latest version. Thanks for solving the issues."

            "I really love Pinterest, it's a great source of dopamine for my ADHD brain. But more and more frequently I'm having trouble saving Pins. They take FOREVER to load (sometimes they don't load at all) and if the Pin isn't fully loaded it won't let me save it to my boards. Also, why can't I search for other people's boards anymore?? Please bring that feature back!",
            "I love this app. It is exceptionally handy, simple to use and much more. It has most of the topics ranging from celebrities, Do It Yourself (D.I.Y) , and many many more. It also helps me to pin the photos, create new boards, looking for new ideas and many more. Thanks for your kindness, helpfulness and keep it interesting. So, keep on improving. I will be looking forward to see many more topics. As I always replying politely, stay home, stay safe and have a great time.",
            "This app has been great in so many ways and I love it. But lately the app keeps crashing. It doesn't stay open for more than 2 seconds and as someone else mentioned, it does stay open in the background. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I switched my cell off and on again. Cleared cache and even did a deep scan of my phone. But nothing seems to be working. Hope the issue gets resolved quickly.",
            "This app was pretty good. I've been using it for 2 years. But lately the app has been crashing very much. It does stays open for more than 2-3 second. Also when i am using any other apps then suddenly a thing pops out saying \"Unfortunately, pinterest has stopped\" . I have seen that others are also facing this same problem. If you can then please repair it asap.",
            "Idk what the hell is going on, but it will go from allowing you to scroll to not allowing anything but moving up and down the pin. You have to back out of the pin you're on, which is possibly really are far down or closer to where the LAST time it stopped letting you scroll, and have to go all the way to the pin you were on. THEN it'll stop scrolling like three pins. Or five. And it needs to be fixed before I change my review. Even updating it didn't fix the issue, if anything it got worse."

I wish I could choose the plain black square, as the other colors are easily confused as I am color- blind.",

I play the game and I am instantly distracted by the longest name ever that goes WAY off the screen. I die. The controls are a little bad, or maybe thats cause I'm on a chromebook. I like it, but I think it works better on the website. I don't trust VOODOO anymore cause I think you guys make us play with robots on the apps... none of these names look real... Anyway, I had fun. Gud Game.",

I had 30ish percent covered....and for no reason went down to less than 5%. Fix these issues for a better rating",

But the problem is They can show at the top in the whole map where we are in small version , Show our way after the game is done where we see our percentage how much we covered .

Also, this can only be done via desktop, as even individual doc removal of headers/footers isn't an option via app - another extreme inconvenience. And when I change the font, the doc has to be refreshed in order for it to reflect the new font. Much inconvenience.",
            "Love it. You can write tons of things. And documents never deletes unless you deleted them. 2 suggestions though. Can you make it so of your writing a story to have the option to have book pages that you can adjust the size cuz im writing a story and i wud LOVE that option. Also not just for storys but for essays and stuff. Would be great for printing 2 so you know size of page. Also have spelling corrections. Thanks google!!",

            "I like it but for the life of me I can't find out how to change the settings for sharing documents. Now whenever I want to share a document it goes automatically to Gmail, and I don't want that. There doesn't seem to be anyway in the app to change that."

            "Been playing for awhile and got enough coins to cash out for a voucher, however everything is showing as sold out. I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore 🙃"

            "Mostly docking points for the system integration (which is classic Adobe arrogance imo). If I could open images directly from the gallery (etc), it would be much more efficient. As-is I have to add it to \"All Photos\" (no other options), open the app manually, open the folder, find the image, and then I can start editing it. Also, while I like the new UI, it took me a bit to find everything. It's not visually obvious that you can swipe the toolbars for one thing.",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! - I have been using this PAID product for over a month and have experienced nothing but persistent crashes.It cant even do an export to JPG without crashing. I have sent numerous reports to Adobe, but nothing has been done. So disappointing, as the product has some good features, but is totally overshadowed by instability issues and the fact Adobe charge you monthly for the pleasure. Maybe it works OK for other platforms, but for Android its a car crash. I've cancelled my subscription and uninstalled. On the look out for a professional product that allows you to edit/save work.",
            "Needs a way to allow the theme to be changed from dark to light. Poor choice of text color for files uploading count. Needs a way to get a list of the files claimed to be uploading which never seem to finish! Always hangs on uploads. Syncing fails on a regular basis to LR Classic. Camera only uses some of the lenses on my LG V40 using Android V10.",
            "A great app I have yet to try the paid version. It does almost anything you want it to. I do have a minor complaint. I use this on my android tablet usually and I wish there were ambidextrous controls. I use my pen a lot and it's very difficult to tune the color and lighting which are all on the right side as a left handed person.",
            "I'm blown away by how much you can do with the free version. It seems a little complicated at first but the more time yo give it the more you learn and the more you realize this is probably the best free editing app available on your phone. Have so many lessons available aswell. Honestly excited about any new updates."

        "comments": [
            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

            "It has been good so far. It is unobtrusive and has provided interesting news items. It is not 5 stars yet (or possibly less) because I have not used it often enough to form an opinion on if the news is biased or not. Update.:. I am liking this app alot. I find myself checking it at least once a day without fail. I like that it sometimes asks if a particular news item is appreciated (hopefully getting a better understanding of what I like)",
            "They've really put a lot of work into the interface and quality of the app which, to be honest, wasn't very good in the past. It seems much more deliberate and with a much greater investment of thought in how it attempts to deliver the news in a \"context\" relavant format, as opposed to how it once felt as if Google was treating it as an afterthought just to have a cursory presence in newsreader apps. Much, much better, I o.",
            "It's pretty good, especially for searching historical articles and emerging trends, but for day to day, you have to be very careful with your curation, it is very easy to create an echo chamber of the same articles, for days, to the exclusion of new things you would want to see. And, on the flip side, not curating your tastes results in only top headline pop culture garbage. Oh, and if you use a browser other than chrome, it gets flaky. I'm looking for something less finicky and more robust.",
            "Not working well in split-screen mode (Tab S7+). With 2 side-by-side apps, opening some articles has the layout configured for the full screen width of the tablet, rather than the width of the split-screen window. Makes it difficult to read, having to scroll both left-to-right on each line. I will revise my review when this issue is fixed.",
            "It's a good news app, it's doesn't have all variety of newspapers all over world ofcourse but it do have popular newspapers. The video quality is good, keeps you up to date in whatever field you want. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars cause it doesn't support \"e - newspapers\". I love e - newspapers a lot and they don't have that feature. Looking for this feature in future updates."

            "At first the app was fun to use and it was helped me to make funny skits. But when I accidentally deleted it and just downloaded it today, it made me let Picsart have the permission to access my Storage. I went to settings to change the permissions but it wouldn't let me, and now I can't do anything. For now I'm giving this 4 stars overall. FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!!!",
            "Okay so, I like this app. I love how you can edit your photos and videos. It's just why cant you edit your videos without the text costing too much. Like I want to edit my videos and add text and it cost too much with the premium. But overall theres not a lot of problems, it does lag so it always mess up my edits and I have to start over. BUT I recommend this app for anyone!👍🏾",
            "been using the premium version for over a year. good but has issues. sometimes slow, sometimes doesn't see images (even those you just edited with this app), even after multiple refresh/reopening the app, the gallery, cleaning the cache and even restarting the phone. no other pics editing app has this issue on my phone. will switch to another app once i find the better option. p.s. they should definitely work on their text editing options. poor so far.",
            "well, it's always going back while im editing, but maybe it's just my phone. it's just MY experience with it. no need to get worked up by it. Edit: well, I've changed to my 4 stars to 2 stars because it won't let me edit. It won't let me do anything. I thought it was my lack of storage space, but I've fred up a lot and it still won't work.",
            "The app is quite good but the only thing I hate is that when I actually want to apply effects to a picture, it keeps loading and then they turn me back to the editing page. I reinstalled the app but it still does the same thing. Please fix this issue real quick or I might uninstall the app"

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "I didn't like at all the latest update because the total system is changed a lot and against a comfort zone. Secondly, the presented screen is small, which is quite disturbing and disappointing. And sending of messages is so difficult and different. Besides, checking infos, links are quite difficult. I am not able to see the participants in a meeting. In short, not so user-friendly. Please fix this and update to previous version. The previous version was much better. Thank you.",
            "The former version of this was better. Ever since my google meet updated, it did not allowed to me join peacefully. It just kept saying either \"Failed to join the meeting\" or \"Cannot connect you to a video call\". It really irritates me, in a way that I'am the President of our class and it's very humilliating for me not to attend. I really HATE the new version. It works on my other relatives phone, but I don't have the chance to ask them to lend me their phone even 'cause they are using it.",
            "After the integration of meet and Gmail app, I can't adjust the volume of the meeting. Even if I click the volume button and move the level to mininum, it stays the same. Please fix this. Seems like this is happening to my specific device model. Edit: After the latest update, it's working fine. Still the 3 star to bring back the old UI.",
            "The recent update is worst!.. Trust me, I am not able to handle this new version of Google meet. I was struggling to find where the chat section was and from where to send messages. I have to zoom each and every thing presented on the screen. The screen looks too small. Once you go in the chat section,you are not able to see the screen. The old version is way better than the new version. Please bring back the old version. Please!",
            "The latest version is the worst and it's a shame considering the app was already great. Typing a message is very frustrating with all the names entering and leaving the meeting appearing in front of the message, this could be solved by putting this feature in the top instead, sometimes your message hides behind the keyboard. This version also doesn't allow to see the chat at the same time as the meeting. Please comeback with the older version and we will all pretend this version never happened."

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

            "THIS is No Joke I'm Positive About This.. Just One... one! Thing. Change it to the old version It's way better. The version in paris where You can send angela Letters And sing with Angela. can we have that back? i Really. really! Like the first version way better than this. Its A Not Kind of fun game now The Update Ate whole of the game. I Promise you If You Change It. it will get more Rates. Its Not only for me Fun, But You to change your new boring game to the old",
            "I WANT THE OLD VERSION! It was so nice . Tom would sing with Angela ,chat with her,ginger would throw a flower pot on Tom's head,there would be an earthquake, a strong gust of wind,the would sing together, Tom would give gifts to Angela.I was awesome!but this version is just boring",
            "Listen here dude the old version \"Tom loves Angela\" was way better. This version is boring and you can see them kiss, hug, dance which is gross. I want to the version when Angela is on the balcony and Tom on the roof, and you could write letters 📝 to Angels and she would answer, also you would sing a song called \"you get me\". Do not install this game. Not good game dev. I have no idea how this game has so many 5 stars.",
            "It's a good game, But I want to add some more features in this games like Tom and Angela live with each other. They go out and we have to dress up them. We have to make food for them, decorate there house and many more. And I also want some action scenes that some thieves took Angela with them and we Tom will go on a mission to rescue her. Please add these features. 🙂",
            "We want the old version So the old version was amazing, And so fun. They could sing songs and chat (I would troll her) She was on a balcony and Tom was on a roof, there could be a earthquake and Ginger could throw a flower pot on Tom's head. Tom could give her gifts and stuff, And there was really fun games as well. This Version This version is really boring. All they can do is Kiss, Hug, dance and read cards. That's literally it. It's super boring, If I could I would give it no star."

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "I have been trying to use my lyft account for about 2 years. When I type in my debit/credit it doesn't not accept it error when I have triple checked it and still won't take it. I typed it in right. It pretty frustrating when you need a ride and can't even access your lyft account for a ride. This has been going of for 2 years now.",
            "Up until tonight Ive loved the app, but as of tonight it charges me for the ride but after I go and order it it just goes back to the select destination screen it doesn't look for a car then it tells me I found a car and be ready in 18 minutes but there's no trace of it inside the app I don't know what's going on right now, I'm very disappointed and kind of stranded not because of this possibly unless this guy just shows up mysteriously in 18 minutes I have no clue if he's going to or not",
            "I have had an account for years but have not used it since 2015. I moved to a new state recently and had re-download lyft and tried to attach my payment methods. I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",
            "Changed my address a week before downloading. My card didnt match my new address when adding it yet. Understandable. But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",
            "Terrible. Added my credit card a day prior and thought it was set to go. Now I request a ride and they want a second credit card that has matching address, provided this unnecessary info and rejected because could not validate, your problem not mine. Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

I use the call feature to reach family and friends in the UK, Hong Kong Indonesia, add Canada inexpensively. I also appreciate not having to set up a link in advance, I just dial and get on.",

You may also add balance and use it as you go. Highly recommended!",
            "Works well for video calls - of course it requires a good internet connection. Occasionally the video will halt for a moment, and once or twice the audio has dropped out. Usually there are no problems. Update: I wish the developers would prioritize the audio. It's usually not a problem if the video freezes briefly, but too often the audio drops out completely.",
            "Works great.... most of the time? So many times messages are delayed because Skype says \"no connection\" even though I have Fiber Optic internet, 895 Mbps connection at the moment. Sms, and othe aps work flawlessly. Unfortunately I get this message multiple times a day which tells me there's an issue with Skype servers. Please fix so I can stop closing the app, clearing the cache and reopening 10x a day!"

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ☹️"

They just look like the branding/marketing team have taken over any they no longer look like they represent a symbol for the apps functionality rather a Google something. I'm beginning to question Google's direction with the inconsistent pixel experience now this garbage...",
            "I have been using this app for many years, however, the new goal-setting function is very inconsistent. I will set a goal to occur every day, and it will skip random days, with no way to re-include those skipped days. It also does not let you define the duration of your goal, which is quite daft. Goals must have dates in order to be effective. The 'smart' notifications are pretty silly; they remind you to complete your goal, and have an option to tap 'later', which defers goals by a whole day!",
            "New update hijacked my Outlook calendar & added notifications for all events, despite NO NOTIFICATIONS set in BOTH Outlook AND Google Calendar app. Update also caused Samsung Calendar to also trigger alarms for Outook events despite being previously disabled as well. Dev's suggestion to cancel alarms in Google app 1 by 1 for each Outlook event is not a fix. As I stated, NO NOTIFICATIONS is the default, so there's nothing to turn off when new events sync."

            "Use to be great but now when editing documents the words jump around to different areas miles from where you are typing. Last update didn't fix this issue and has created many more. Some documents have gone missing, tells me I need to upload already saved files when you try to open them, uploading creates two copies then if you save the newest when you reopen it asks if you want to open the new document and opens in the old file!!! Hours of work lost.",
            "It has very nice features and plus it gives; any benefits like creating forms of our choise... It can be of checkbox, multiple choice. Etc But there should be effects like darkning or lightning the presentation or any other thing to make without upgrading to the premium....... And also without buying. It should be free and there should be more creative templates.",
            "Used to be a good app until the last update now basic functions are just for the premium accounts and it's more bombarded with ads and that's just frustrating. Fix this or put me on the previous version. I still like the app, if you can fix these issues in the next update I'll be glad. Thanks🙂",
            "It's an mediocre app , it lets me view any pdf files that the in-built pdf app imln my mobile doesn't let me see. But, I'm willing to bet that there are many more good apps than this one, it doesn't even let you share pdf files without the premium version. In short : It's a good app for just viewing and editing pdf files, but I wouldn't suggest i for professional or daily use.",
            "Was good and bought 1 year Premium but all of a sudden they start to give me adds again. And its started to change some of my documents to different format like Chinese and diamond shapes. This app is now pretty useless. Spent 2 days rewriting my documents and 24 hours later they changed back to different format again. Extremely unhappy"

In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "Loved this app until I got paid version. There are too few filers and it gets boring. None of the previous filters are in it, and I've seen many over the past couple of years. The fun section still only does side by side comparison instead of the whole picture. I'm not sure why it's so expensive with so few features. What it does do, it does very well. Impressions and presets are almost identical, make up too. A few pre-made looks could do the trick e.g \"Beach babe\" , \"barbie\", \"dictator\"",
            "I absolutely love this app. There is honestly no better app of its type. A massive problem though, is that I couldn't pay for the lifetime membership :( - the monthly plan works, but i wanted the lifetime plan... I'm new to Android, so if it's something that I need to fix, can you please inform me. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, and added many different payment methods (all with enough money in the accounts) my problems aside, even the free version of this app is worth 5 stars.",
            "This is the first time I'm saying, \" Today, 22-10-2020, I'm declaring that if there is a option to give 7 🌟, then I must give that. Seriously 😘. This AI app is the best of best! If I want to change the face or other tasks it will take an hour in Photoshop. Thanks for giving us Pro feature using Ad. Stay happy all the time, take care and stay safe at home 🏡.",
            "I absolutely love this app! There are still so many features available even without the paid version, and they actually all look real!! However, I am encountering one issue. For some reason, the \"My kids\" 1 and 2 are taking FOREVER to load. I know it's not an wifi problem because all the other ones load just fine and my wifi is really good. I will definitely change my review to a 5 star once this is fixed, thank you!",
            "This app is very good. I love the option on the app that allows you to see what your future children may look like. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because of minor errors such as having the girls look like 80 year old men or making the children look more like girls in the boy part instead of boys. I also suggest that this app would be really cool if an anime option was added. I've seen videos on this, and I think it would make the app more successful and up in rankings! Thanks!"

Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

            "Zedge is an awesome application for the customization of your ringtones and notification sounds. It has an incredible selection of wallpapers but I wouldn't say that's the star quality of this app but when it comes down to customizing ringtones and notification sounds... I haven't searched for a notification, alarm, or ringtone that Zedge didn't have, or a supplemental sound that sounds just as good if not better!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! I don't think I will ever use another software/program!!",
            "I love it . But they don't have \"WHAT'S UP\" . They used to. I had it as my friends ring tone and somehow I lost it. I have been trying and trying to find it again, to no avail . All I could find is these stupid whistle songs. I really want the loud \"WHAT'S UP \" I believe it came from a Budweiser commercial. My friend says it all the time. I am hard of hearing so I need a really loud ring tone. Otherwise it's a great app.",
            "Went downhill. Can't find download files for live wallpaper and mandatory 30 sec ads to download each wallpaper, and then not being able to find it. And they even include a little useless chat bubble that says it's stored in internal storage > data but it's not there (and the article they link you to is useless too!) 🙃🙃 Honestly I have this app cause I've used it for over 5+ years but yikes it sucks now.",
            "Mediocre! It used to work perfectly, no problems. But recently when I allocate a ringtone to either my phone or a contact it works for a short time, then reverts back to the default phone ringtone. When I try to reallocate the ringtone in the app, it states, 'Something went wrong'. I initially paid the £3.99 thinking this may fix the issue, but no luck. Cancelled the prescription immediately. Only get this app if you like getting ignored by the app developers, as I've still not had any response.",
            "I like the Zedge app's massive amount of ringtones, notifications, and wallpapers to choose from, but I don't think this app has enough different categories of smartphone customizing features available. I think this app, it's developers, and it's users would all benefit greatly from a few theme customization options to download, for example, there could be an in-app option that allows the user to create their own custom app themes, custom text fonts, and a customized wallpaper creator."

Once my sister was playing and suddenly she got to see an add with an almost naked person. It's disturbing to see such things especially on a kids app. Please, the developers should look forward to it. Thanks.",
            "Very cool! I personally think that the outfits are very cool and stylish. The graphics and audio are also very adorable and cute. My 2 year old sister is very joyful about this application. Please add more updates and try to fix some bugs. Keep up the good work and never stop until you feel happy and pleased with your game. You're very amazing to help us with stress. I love taking care of Tom!",
            "I wanted to install the game again and immediately installed it... I used to love this game and now there afe THREE packages you can click to earn something by watching an ad and normally I don't mind that but they won't go away. They follow you in every room and it annoys me so much that the fun of decorating is taken by that... So no, not again... Pretty sad",
            "Never pass this game. All the comments about this were wrong. They don't know how to play and always loose so they give all of you a bad review. This is my suggestion do not leave this game. I was always on this game when ever i have time. You all would like it. And it's birthday's come very fast ❗❗❗❗and it level up also very faster. I love this game. There are some rumors about this game but they sre not true, when speaking of Talking Angela the things are true. I saw something in her eye. 🤗🤗",
            "I played this game since I was 3 years old my brother gave the suggestion of this game and I only not love this game but all your games and also your to see your videos . Now too I love to play this game now I am 10 years old. But please add more mini games.😺"

It says my account already exists. Why are you guys making it difficult? Why isn't there a customer service centre or a quick helpline? It's frustrating when I want to use your app but can't because of this glitch. Can y'all please help me?",
            "I got a new phone so now I can't sign in since I don't have access to my old phone number. I would try and make a new account but someone is using my new phone number. I tried to contact customer support but they tell me to sign into the app and send them some information. Funny thing is, I can't sign in, that's my problem!! Worst customer support, all they have is bots that keep repeating the same things over and over, I'm honestly done, and Uber can suck me.",
            "App doesn't have a sign in feature that is easily accessible. I can't log in to change my phone number to my new one, because my email is in use. If I try to sign in by social it also locks me because email is use. This is a joke of a UX, use LYFT, this app and experience is trash.",
            "Previously i had booked many cab with uber. But now i dont know what is this otp thing that has come. Firstly the trip is not shown when i have already booked. I have to again do the booking so that trip info comes up. Next when the cab comes he asks otp. And this has been three time. I have even updated my app and rechecked the phone no too. But still i dont recieve any otp. So please look into it.",
            "It's very hard to get support from a real person, and even if you manage to do it (it's hidden behind layers and layers of FAQs, ridiculous) they're unhelpful af, and don't even understand the platform they're supposed to work with. I've deleted my account and uninstalled the app, and you should do the same unless you wanna go through hell when something goes wrong (it will)"

            "It's great at first but it start to get really irritating when you can't do anything without paying or watching ads. The ads are incredibly long. When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",
            "Some users are complaining about the bubbles, and how the useful colours don't show up until it's far too late to win. I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",

Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

            "The app is super great but there's just an improvement I would like to see. It's about the touch option on my Bluetooth earbuds, coz it has an option that touching it once either play or pause the video. The pause function is working but the play isn't. It's working on VLC but I kinda like using your app coz it's much easier when loading subtitles. I know it's really not an issue, hence rating it 5 stars coz I can just play it on my mobile but just wanted to let you know on something to improve.",
            "I have been using only MX player on my phone for years but the recent update has messed up its navigation system. Reasons: 1. A new feature has been added to seek the video by 10 secs by double click and now I'm so much used to using it for play/pause & there is absolutely no way to turn this feature off. 2. When you try to seek the video by swiping screen or even by using the forward/backward button, it doesn't move ths video according to the customized settings. I'm using it Note 9 btw",
            "Please Add Subtitles option for movies added in Mx Player. It will be good development in app to enhance user experience. Right now only online Subtitles available for playing movies from our folder. Already added Websereies and movies please enable the subtitles option. In case if I want to watch Tamil movies or kannada movies there are subtitles available. Please develop this option for MX Player.",
            "This app is awesome... I've been using this app for 2-3 years by now. The local video player is amazing and the customization is beyond amazing. But there's only one little simple problem though, that you haven't fixed yet. The brightness bar. Yeah the brightness bar you gave is 15 point bar instead of a 100. And the lowest point in the bar isnt even the dimmest brightness of the handset. Please do this one upgrade as soon as you can. And do the same for the volume bar too while youre at it plz",
            "This has been a really useful video player. I'm able to watch some of my favorite movies which I didn't get to by downloading or via Youtube. It also has a great feature of synchronisation to fix the videos which are not synced correctly. It also saves me the trouble of seeking subtitles of movies and TV shows from the browser. But I gotta say the ads are way too annoying. Whenever I open it or pause a video while the mobile data is on ads get in my way. Fix this so that I'll be glad to give 5 ⭐"

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "Not sure what's happening at the moment but Shazam is not picking up any songs, it's struggling with movies, TV shows, new releases etc etc. I do absolutely love this app, but I'm missing so much good stuff! I just hope all my recordings you're taking is going to good use! I'd love to see some stats. It scares me how much you take on of everybody's lives when they use your app. Please be smart, safe and sensible with our lives 🙏💪🥰 #illgiveahigherreviewsoon",
            "This is awsome! I was wondering how could i identify the music I've been watching in YouTube, cause the owner of the video didn't credit the song. I was finding a way to detect this song and i found the Shazam app it was a great pleasure to detect my interest song in just a seconds! Great job! It was useful to other people who wanted to find their fav song! I gave 5 stars ✨ keep it up shazam! ❣️",
            "EDIT: Tray icon added. Now I can instantly launch 5 Stars, like I promised, leaving my original review intact... OK so far... But I just want a button in the notification tray, I don't want the bubble on screen the entire time. Sure, I can move it around, but that's a pain. If there is some way to ONLY have something in the notification tray, it's 5 stars otherwise.",
            "I was using an app from sony on an old xperia but they discontinued the app, been using this for a year or two now, helps when finding a song from a movie or the show I'm watching, since upgraded to a new phone I get an issue now and again it keeps the app open and recording for songs apparently, manage to get it cancelled but it happens again over time",
            "Like many others, I'm uninstalling Shazam due to Shazam recently adding a persistent notification alert that can't be dismissed. Sorry Shazam, I don't need your un-dismissible spam cluttering my notification area, especially when I only use your app a few times a year. Whoever added the un-dismissible notification to the app deserves to be fired and never work in the tech industry again!"

            "Good but needs updation There is no flexibility to change the font, size of the font, underline, highlight with color, etc. When we take a lot of notes we demand certain highlighting options that makes the important points to be visible. But this note pad, unfortunately doesn't have the feature. Also the theme should be flexible. Not everyone would love dark theme. Or not all the time dark theme suits. Perhpas what Google docs have should be incorporated in google keep too.",
            "I like this app too much, but any sequence of number it thinks is a phone number and suggest me to call it, but it isn't a phone number. It's very hard to edit line of numbers, because the app alway pop-up an window to suggest you to make a call, you have to click on edit, but if it was on the wrong spot then you'll have to click again, select edit. Always like that, can you guys fix it? I don't save phone numbers on Google Keep, I do it on contacts. 160 (14) /559 isn't a phone number.",
            "This is a great app with a wonderful user interface, but it would be good to have other fonts for use. Additionally, it would be good if we could change font sizes. Lastly, it would be good if you had the option to make the list only partly a checklist (if you press the checklist button it makes everything apart of the list, granting it a checkbox). Thanks! 👍",
            "Hey Google! I hope this isn't too much to ask for, for the Google Keep app...but When writing a note, the date & time is saved but when edited it changes and that's perfectly fine but I was wondering if u could still have the original date & time saved. For example, I wrote a note yesterday at 5pm & edited it this morning at 8am, but let's say I wanted to look back at the original time and date that I wrote the note on, I think it would be a good idea to tap on the edited date & time to see it.",
            "I personally love the app and I use it almost every day for everything. Though I think there are things that could be better. Like for example, a feature where you can protect notes with password/pin. I'd also love to see a feature wherein we can add more photos in whatever part of the notes we choose (not just one at the top). Also, the ability to change font size or at least make some texts italicized/bold. Would it also be possible to make a subtask under a subtask? Thanks a bunch!"

            "I've been using Google Maps for years, and update my timeline every day so I've got an accurate tracking record of where I've been. And then, today, I find that most of the data for this and previous years has suddenly disappeared (it was there yesterday). Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",
            "This had been one of the most useful apps I ever used. But for the last several weeks it is not responding. I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",
            "Stopped working. I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",
            "Terrible! Google maps has been my go to for years on every phone I've had now over the past week the maps won't load the addresses and won't give directions. I have uninstalled then reinstalled for under a minute temporary fix then it does it all over again. I can't get any numbers or find my way unless I zoom into the map and follow my blue icon showing where I am. If I didn't know how to read maps ill be f***ed. This is bad."

And then, today, I find that most of the data for this and previous years has suddenly disappeared (it was there yesterday). Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",

I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",

I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",
            "Terrible! Google maps has been my go to for years on every phone I've had now over the past week the maps won't load the addresses and won't give directions. I have uninstalled then reinstalled for under a minute temporary fix then it does it all over again. I can't get any numbers or find my way unless I zoom into the map and follow my blue icon showing where I am. If I didn't know how to read maps ill be f***ed. This is bad."

Now I cant even open up the app. When i attempt to do so, it just crashes every single time. I've already cleared the app data and cache via the settings but it still wont open up properly. Hoping to get this fixed asap before I have to stick with google chrome going forward. **UPDATE** Fixed a while ago. Best browser period",

However, as much as I do enjoy the fact that you can change how you want to display your tabs, the password for \"secret mode\" especially with a biometric scanner is genius in my opinion. However, I just wish the address bar was easier to use.. it feels like im using an old Samsung before mobile compatibility was a thing",
            "Samsung Internet is the best app ever seen It is easy to use and customizable settings. I loved it using this browser. I recommend all the others to use this app. But there is some drawbacks. It doesn't have settings for downloads like concurrent downloads. I would like if it is added in the next update.",
            "It works good and I like it! The only thing is you can only have 50 (or now 99) tabs open at once, so be sure to bookmark or save elsewhere any pages you think you want to go back and see again sometime. If it gets to 50 (or now 99) tabs open and you open another tab, the oldest tab will automatically be closed."

            "This app is great. Lots of options. However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",
            "Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But \"watching\" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

            "There are lots of things I liked about this app like the ability to modify its appearance, but the autocorrect is really getting out of hand. Even though I've gone into the app's settings and turned off autocorrect, it's still changing every other word I type into something I have to go back, delete and correct. I'm just about giving up on texting or emailing from my phone now because it takes at least twice as long to clean up all the autocorruptions and retype. Is there a fix for this?!",
            "They've done something to The voice to text option and it is not picking up when I am using punctuation. Instead of inserting the punctuation it's actually spelling the word out. For example once I am done with the sentence if I say (period) ......before it would normally put a . (period) at the end of the sentence whereas now it spells the word out. it also does this randomly. it is a real pain and makes using voice to text very annoying and irritating!",
            "It's a great application except every time I do voice recognition it does not capitalize the first word of every sentence. Even though I have the setting to capitalize the word at the start of each sentence. how do I fix it? Now whenever I say period it spells out the word period instead of putting punctuation. Please fix that as well.",
            "Seems to be allowing a GIANT glitch in my operating system. Until recently I didn't have any problems, then I think something was updated and allowed a virus to be entered into my phone. This has happened before. I just started to uninstall applications until my phone started to work properly again. What a pain in my backside!",

            "App has stopped syncing. It stopped for 3 or 4 days. It then worked for 2 or 3 days. Now it has stopped syncing again the last 1 or 2 days and still won't sync. Previous to the last 2 weeks it was what I used for my email accounts. Now I have to think about finding another email program. Is this a known issue that you are fixing? What has happened in the last 2 weeks that is causing the app to become useless? Please reply thanks.",
            "I used to use search a lot ( in my iPhone mail) . But in Samsung Email the Search is poor. It seems I cant search for text in emails? ( I can only search by email addresses (?) ) Also why is the search option buried? I have to open the side menu then scroll down to search. Email Search is probably the most important thing in an email client (after sending and receiving emails) It needs a one click or swipe nav option from the front screen of any email client.",
            "This app was great. It's the only one I have found that I can sort my email. It has so many options to choose from to keep your email the way you want. Unfortunately it will not sync my emails anymore. This started happening weeks ago.. I would have to turn off sync and turn it back on and restart my phone, it would update my email. But not anymore. It has not updated in 3 days. Is there a fix to this?",
            "Takes forever to find old emails. When searching it first gives an option to search 6 months, once it starts you cannot do anything until it has completed the search. Once finished it will then begin to load the content of each email. Even if i can see the email i want listed, i cant access it until the entire search has been completed!! Why not have a stop searching button so i can get on with what i need!!!",
            "I like the convenience of the app. Only wish it recognized spam mail more better. Other than that I'm very pleased with the app. Not having to go to several emails saves a lot time. Honestly I've tried this with another app and it was absolutely awful and didn't receive all of my mail. I've doubled checked and I receive everything. Highly recommend."

If you are watching on a phone, you can minimise the screen and have it playing in a small box which you can move around, so you can play games or text at the same time as watching something. It so good, I completely recommend it, get it now! No ads disturb your watching experience either, and I really like that. You can also have multiple accounts for different people.",
            "Netflix has recently started to be a lil buggy The first issues I am having is, As I am watching my show, all of the sudden it just freezes. Second issues is that it once in a while their is a minor lagg. . I think it had started about a week or two ago. But other than that, it perfect. I hope that they fix it ASAP.",
            "This used to work fine on my phone but now for some reason the audio in some movies stops working as the video plays, video stops and audio plays, or even sometimes both audio and video stop. I try skipping ahead and going back to my spot but it rarely fixes the problem, and if it does, its only fixed for a few moments. This has happened in numerous movies ive tried to watch so i try a different movie and the same problem keeps occuring. Its getting on my nerves. Please fix it quickly.",
            "Only thing I wish you guys implement is to add a proper video resolution selection option for both streaming and downloading. Just let us control the resolution that we need. You can definitely add an algorithm to reduce the selected resolution if the network doesn't support it. Apart from that everything is great. Just look at prime video. Their app is so good. This rating will change when a proper resolution selection tool gets implemented.",
            "My only complaint is the subtitle size. I switch between my phone and TV. I like small subs on phone and normal on the TV. It doesn't make sense that I can only change subtitle size through the web and not the app itself. It should be a basic function within the app. It's very annoying that everytime I want to switch devices I have to go through the web, which takes ages to reflect. Take some inspiration from Amazon Prime app. They let you change anything about the subs. Improve please."

            "It is absolutely really helpful. It helped me with alot of things like my module, homework, math, measuring, etc. I love this app and it's completely free! So what are you waiting for? Download now! This is probably the most awesome math problem solving app ever! #1 the best calculation app ever! I can't stop using it! This app is awesome and what i like about it is that it knows how to multiply and calculate everything which is awesome!",
            "It's the best maths solving app I have ever seen. I am not a premium user but I am happy with my experience with this app. It is not necessary to buy premium because an average math student can understand the steps provided by non premium photomath.I don't know how much the premium is good but if the non premium is this much good then premium will be outstanding. And the best way to get rid of ADS for a non premium user is don't turn on internet while using this app. But there's no deceptive ADS",
            "For me, personally, the app used to be better when explaining solutions, but it's still very good. I wish it would explain graphs however. There's no ads, however you have to pay for some features, but it's not bad to the point that the app loses value if you don't buy premium, personally, I haven't. Highly suggest",
            "Brilliant! This app is very helpful and useful! I used this to check my answers to math problems and equations and it showed me the correct answers as well as the solution too! Not only that, most of the features we all need in solving mathematics is in the app for FREE. Now I understand Math even better without the feeling the uneasiness of solving math problems and equations. I really love it.",
            "I liked the app ever since. It really helps me solve my math problems that gives specific and understandable solution. I deleted the app years ago, and now I installed it again. Ot surprised me knowing now, you will have to pay in order to access such as show specific steps. I'm kinda disappointed at the same sad. It does give you 7 days trial, but really I was expecting more."

App cannot launch properly so it closes. I try to launch again but theres the same scenario all time. Im on Huawei P30 Lite. Message to developers: please undo last update if you can. Now many people cant even open the app. I was on level 1410, its a pity to lose all this progress. This game is so cool and I dont wanna put it in the garbage.",
            "I loved the game until the new update, I was at level 1171. The new update made it so I can't even open the app anymore! I may never play again because I don't want to loose my levels. Also the controls sometimes glitch and if I try not to complete the line all the way around the obstacles it'll mark it as if I've touched it. The game is pretty enough for what it does.",
            "Brilliant gameplay, my go to game. I was on level 482 before I updated. Now, the app won't even bloody open. I have been trying to open it for the last week or so but still no hope. I've tried every solution under the sun, except for deleting it because I don't want to lose my place in the game. Nevermind I guess🤷🏻‍♀️",

Nice casual no brainer albeit not difficult at all, no matter what the game ads say. Edit:app keeps stopping at start,will not run anymore. Since there was no update to the app I suspect the Corona terror related rubbish that was put into Android.",
            "This game was my favorite game but after its latest update(the change of the icon of the game) the game had stopped working and is just taking my phone's storage and whenever I try to open this app it does not open and it shows that color fill 3D is not responding or it shows that color fill 3D keeps stopping and we always get 3 options 1. Write a feedback 2. App info 3. Close app and even after sending many feedbacks in which the same problem that is occurring is written but still it's the same"

            "It was all fine until I had to transfer to YouTube Music, which to listen to music properly, requires a subscription. But YouTube didn't transfer my music, it just didn't work, which is frustrating. They don't care about people's satisfaction in listening to music, they only care about gaining money through subscriptions. Google Play Music was good, see that key word, was. YouTube Music doesn't need my money so I could listen to my music. It needs better function.",
            "It was working fine. I could happily listen to music offline. I honestly think that YouTube Music is really pointless since there's already a bunch of songs, covers, and instrumentals on YouTube itself. This is only getting a 1 star review and I have no actual regrets. Honestly who was dense enough to think of this idea, they should've known that no one would like this idea, it's such a fraud. If we now need internet to listen to music then that's really dumb. Have fun reading all the reviews",
            "Used the app a lot from the get go. Worked perfectly. I put all of my purchased/downloaded music on it for about 3-4 years. Then, the app was \"moved\".... along with all of my music. 3 years worth of music erased completely. I'm pretty disgusted.... so much, that I don't even want to give YouTube music a chance once I saw that my music wouldn't transfer. Not one song. All of my playlist titles are there... but no songs. I've tried multiple times and searched extensively. It's a complete RIP off.",
            "I have been using this app for years, even I changed phones. And I am happy to use it even when offline. The last time I used this app was yesterday before updating. Then I realized the app is discontinued and becomes Youtube Music. The wonderful memories and arranged music just gone. Well, it is nice while it lasted and it's time to move on. Goodbye.",
            "This app was perfect. Loved the format. Very user friendly. Love the fact that I could play music on my phone while phone was asleep or when using other apps. YouTube music sucks . I have to keep my phone awake while using. Also I can't easily play my personal music downloaded to my phone. Ill pay for Google music if I have to. How can I get it back? F your commercials, F your format, change something that was flawless. I will never listen to any music on YouTube music."

            "This was a great app. I used to be able to navigate through my downloaded episodes in a single swipe. Now it takes a couple taps to get to my downloads... Annoying, but I can live with it. More recently, the app won't download new episodes of my favorite podcasts. It churns and churns, and eventually shows an error. I've tried clearing the cache and force stopping the app, but no improvement.",
            "At first, I didn't think I would like the change over. But so far I am loving it!❤ These are the things I like: Being able to see other podcasts that interest me, with this Covid 19 many of my subscribed podcasts are not able to broadcasts regularly, so now I have my regulars and new ones.🤣 Having watched podcasts automatically deleted after a period of time. This is what can be done in the Settings section. 😍Now I am loaded with great podcasts!",
            "Pretty decent. Navigation and appeal would be greatly improved by implementing simple colored and semi transparent boxes/containers. With the current b&w layout the look and feel is muddy and immediately makes you want to look for other options. If you stick around to play with it, you get yourself used to it. No good reason why it needs to turn you off before you even give it a chance.",
            "The app is currently unusable. It won't update available podcast episodes with new releases, and I know others having the same problem. This isn't the first major problem I've had with the app either. In the past, there were serious audio issues, which were eventually resolved. Overall it's poorly maintained, and I'll be moving on permanently to other apps.",
            "I was going to raise my rating when I figured out there was a \"sleep\" function, but I really dislike the new home page layout. I liked the grid and ability to order podcasts. One line bar across the top is a pain to scroll through since it appears to go in I assume newest update order (which is not how I choose what to listen to). Edit:Getting used to the crappy layout but until there is the ability to add an rss feed I will not change my rating. Also the ability to rate podcasts would be nice."

            "Last update on Google play was sept 16, and today Oct 10 I am told my app is out of date. This is a security app, not tetris. Also, won't start automatically after restart sometimes. I have to manually start it (if I notice it's not running).",
            "Hello, my phone has been spammed. I thought this app is supposed to protect against that. Now I don't know how to stop the spamming. I keep getting messages that my phone will be locked if I don't install and pay for Spam protection.",
            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",
            "App doesn't allow Web security. You turn on 2 seconds later the app crashes I have no idea if I'm safe browsing on the Web > latest version 9/16 Issue still a problem !!!"

And the other problem is that I get the notifications for new messages but they don't load in chats and channels!!! It's so annoying... Please fix it .",
            "No way to delete my info. Installed to find no way to make calls. Very unclear about why the selected only 3 contacts to sync out of my list. Was hoping to be able to make voip calls but this does not replace a conventional messenger and phone. No dial pad. No video calls like I was under the impression were here. Just really unsure what the point of the AP is all together. Like is this just for messeging strangers? I don't want that at all.",
            "i updated the app last night and since then it doesn't shows the last message in some channels and groups. you can see the last message from chat list but when you open the channel it's not there. and it skips some messages in channels or groups. it also doesn't show the source channel when i forward a message to my own channel.",
            "I would give it a 5 star rating. The animation are great and the fact that I have been told that I can send file/s up to 2gb in size is great (Not done so as yet) The problem ⚠️ I am having is I receive no notification sounds. Just vibration. I have looked up and down on how to change it, but no joy😐"

            "Once I catch on how to maneuver within this app just maybe I'll be able to say it's a good one. One thing I can say is there's too many changes all at one time. Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... I like this app, but it's appears when using other apps. Otherwise, interference, unpredictable behavior and isn't stable.",
            "The app is pretty good. As it says it's fun to search and it's life too? The only issue I have is with downloads. We can't download pages like we can in chrome. Since there is no multiple tabs option there should atleast be an option where I can save some sites I wanna read later. If this is the only browser app a person uses like me then it's not so efficient. Coz I disabled chrome since it takes up a lot of space. Please do something about this. Else it's a great app. No complaints. 😄",
            "This app is great, and a great alternative to Chrome and Google. It is very easy to use and it has Google Assistant built into it when you voice search. It has a lite, incognito, and normal. It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much",
            "Excellent for many features, 1. Multiple sessions, each search in a separate window. 2. Lite mode, pages load faster and easier to read 3. More convenient search box location. 4. Opens some of the blocked sites in some countries. 5. Has bookmarks to open frequently visited pages. And more... The bad: if you left the app to another app then back, the page reloads again, very annoying when you read and compare two pages.",
            "This is a very good light browser. Very fast, always loads practically instantly even on my 4 year old s7. Very helpful side features; though I dont use them very much personally, I can see that many people would. It gives relevant search suggestions. Some features such as advanced searches are missing, but I have found that I mainly use this for finding a fact or an image quickly. Then, if I need more information, I switch to my normal browser, firefox."

            "I mostly play free style but one problem is there that player there are coward, means either they left their chance of strike and wasting time by fearing that they may open the beat so opponent get advantage. Please do something player like this. Better you implement overall game time system eg. 5 mins or 10 mins per match max so that atleast time will not be wasted.",
            "A good game. However, it encourages cheating rather than sportsmanship. Why different strikers. A person looking for another person to make game for him. Sometimes if you are given the striker to start never starts. No fine and he still wins. This game favours who make purchases. Total cheating and nothing. All matches are fixed. Had suggested times and again but no hearing from your team. It seems above facts are correct. Encourages fixing and cheating. Worst game ever i played.",
            "Good to play in spare time but few of the things are not that great about the game.. 1. You need a very good internet connection. 2. Rules should have been same as Carrom. There are certain scenarios which are not counted as a foul. E.g. Directly hittting opponen's puck and not hitting any of your pucks etc. 3. Another turn should be given in case of double fine. 4. No sportamanship at all. Players can have different strickers with more abilities. 5. 2/2 matches will be great if provided.",
            "It is a awesome game I would like to give more than 5 stars but still there are some issues in it. I think there are some hackers. After the time ran out the opponent can still operate and control striker and they pot a coin this is unfair and I also tried one time but for me it is not working after the time runs out. So please notice my issue",
            "The game is very good and it is good for time pass. I loved the concept of variour strikers and powers. It has made the look of the struke phenomenal. However, like the last month the season should be carrom pass event there for each month. So, that one should get some rewards after completing each level in the carrom pass whether they have purchased it or not. That promotes the players to play this game. I hope we will receive similar kind of update soon."

            "I HATE games that force you through an extremely slow tutorial without the option to open settings. I'm listening to my audiobook and have been tapping for 20 minutes and still there is no option to turn off the sound. It's also incredibly dumb that you can't tap tap and upgrade at the same time, and there is no \"buy max\" button. This tutorial is going on forever, I hate being railroaded by a game Edit: apparently the railroading never stops. Uninstalling",
            "It keeps you busy at night and it's just a game to keep you distracted when you need it in the game you save up money and you tap to Rainbow and the more you tap the more buildings you can buy the house gets upgraded it's really fun and I've already playing it for 2 hours",
            "Wants to give us random ads during play but when it comes time for ads to double prizes like being offline for 9 hours and double that income suddenly ads no longer will load and you lose the double income. Had daily reward and went to watch ad to exchange only to get no reward at all",
            "I don't know why there's no close button after spinning for an advisor. I tapped all over the screen and nothing happens and basically you're forced to close the app and restart after every spin because there's nothing else you could do."

I am just a bit disappointed with the new updates because of some errors we faced when messaging the sellers. We already confirmed the items, yet when it loads the confirmation is lost. We are unsure if the product is already on process. Please, read the reviews over here, Lazada. Thank you.",

            "It has always been clitchy and slow loading but it was tolreable. But, since the latest update when I place my order it says 'oops something went wrong' ! And I am unable to get to the payment page! Had this problem 6 months ago and now it has happened again !! Constant updates! Used work well....if it ain't broke don't try to fix it !!!",
            "The worst app ever to cross my phone. I don't understand how people are. Comfortable using this app when you can simple be lost while ordering 1 item, different sellers and different tabs to open and every seller has his own page and the bugs the app have with the confirmation and the Ads.. After all of this.. How Could a person accept buying an item and paying double or maybe triple the item price as a shipping fee.. I ordered 4 items with total 600p and the shipping was 549P...",
            "The app overall design and feel is just fine but their customer service is bad. I have already reported and followed up a concern multiple times about a bug (status mismatch, already delivered but still in To Receive list) in their app 3 months ago but they did not fix it until now"

            "Well, these are some ideas for this app to become better: 1. Add a chat room for the respective people in that classroom, so the communication between student-teacher is a lot easier. 2. The teachers should a notification when we turned in a homework and see how many of them we turned in. 3. You should be able to select multiple files, not only one by one. I think that's all for now, but I think I'll find more issues ASAP. Please start add more QoL.",
            "The app is great but got worse after the new updates. The to do list keep on refreshing but nothing popped up, the notification section complete got removed and this made navigating the app much more difficult. If these problems are resolved, I will change the rating. Thanks.",
            "this app is very great but I am experiencing some issues. my school provided a school account to us and i logged in to that account in google classroom on my laptop and it worked really well but when I downloaded Google Classroom on my mobile and when i tried to login through my school account it said that i have no permission to login into google classroom when clearly I was using google classroom on my laptop I hope this would be fixed soon please consider my concern and help me out on my problem hope this info was helpful",
            "Google Classroom works fine for the most part. Everything seems to be working fine and I can access all my classes easily. However, there is one annoying issue I am experiencing. The app stopped sending mobile notifications a while ago and I can't tell whenever an assignment is posted. The whole point of me downloading this app was to receive mobile notifications. Please fix this issue. Also, a dark mode would be nice.",
            "I request the respected developer team to kindly change the layout completely...🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 ...as whenever i use to open Google classroom its a boring layout .... Just try to make it attractive so that whoever goes to use it become mentally active and be happy ..... Also please try to add more functions to it .... Its a request to the developer team ...... Kindly read my review and try to do whatever you can do..... Full respect to your work....🙏🏻🙏🏻"

The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

It just freezes and does nothing so now I can't go on websites anymore! Can you tell me what the problem is so I can fix it? If you don't have the answer, I'll be bored forever without going to any websites! 😡😡😡 I hate this app sometimes because of this problem, but it only happened there.",
            "About 1 out of every 4 searches won't go through. They'll load for a second before the bar gets stuck at the end, and no search results populate the screen. Nothing is wrong with my phone or internet. Chrome app searches work 100% of the time. Google app is the issue, its been like this off and on for years, but recently has been acting up constantly.",
            "I am using a oneplus nord and whenever i search, this kept showing me ' check your internet connection' even when my connection is fast. Now, after the recent update, it is not even showing that, its just a blank white screen and nothing else. Sometimes it's working when i try again after reopening the app. Most of the time its not. Hope you'll fix this problem ASAP.",
            "So actually, i like google since years ago. But 3 days ago or 1 week ago, i can't translate. It's maybe not like i need to update it, beacuse it only said \"UNINSTALL OPEN\". So it's probablly confusing. I don't know why i can't translate. And also, There's a lot of bugs that i can't explain. Please fix these. Thank you! By the way, I apologize for my wrong grammars or bad english.",
            "I'm honestly going to switch to another app. Google has been ok with simple searches. However with the election coming up I've been trying to search up different facts and information on Biden and Trump, only to find rather biased results. I can even look up specific dates, name, and even addresses. The results are the same, many articles on things Trump has done wrong, or praise articles on Biden. It's not because of my search relevance either, I had all of that reset. Very disappointed."

When I also understood that review your edits and use the brush for Double Exposure, I was so stoked because the only problem I had with this app was that the image does not get inside properly and when I try to darken the added image, the 1st one gets lighter and then gets beneath.

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*.

And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

My android cell phone had an update recently, the app icon has changed and e mail works fine from my phone but not my tablet. I've looked for an update but nothing so far. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail.",
            "Please make a simple way to delete in bulk. Ie, create a check-box to select multiple email at once. (Be sure to advise everyone that they'll have to change sync settings in all Google apps and devices. (Make that easy to do as well!) Or perhaps create a simpler way to check all settings that need apply. *Ease of access is key* It's annoying and is the reason I had to create 25 different Gmail accounts bc we don't have money to purchase any extra storage features. Please and thanks!",
            "Edit: the update got a new logo and now my emails take 30 minutes or more to send. Nice. Very nice. 🙄 This app is very behind compared to other apps. Where is the \"select all\" option? This app will only work with its limited features for those who dont have a lot of emails.For someone like me this isnt a possibility so this will no longer be my main emailing app.",
            "Just like all of Google's other products, this too does not work as expected. All of Google's products are failing lately. I have emails sitting there waiting to be read, but I rarely get a notification of them. And I am talking about the emails in my inbox, not the ads or subscription emails. That part of gmail actually still works quite well with those being separated into separate folders. I'm looking for apps that replace all of Google's apos... might even consider (gasp!) Apple's iPhone!",
            "Updates? Practically every other day but out of 15 emails I had today not one was in primary list. Every day I move them between primary; updates and promotions and still not one in the right place. You work on it every day but as far as I can see not one useful thing comes out of it. Oh yeah!!

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

            "This is one of the best apps I use. Makes paying friends, storing rent money, and buying things online way easier and more convenient. Edit: I have LastPass and I've noticed this may be the only app where I can't get the password to copy over after I've pushed the autofill button for my password app. I have to manually copy and paste my password. For that reason I had to downgrade. Still a necessary app for me, and I like having it.",
            "This is a great app. Very simple, you really don't need a bank account linked to it and still use basically anywhere for anything. I would and do recommend this app to anyone trying to purchase on line, transfering/recieving money to someone, even getting paid from jobs on line I know this is the safest and fastest way to keep track of my money.",
            "I haven't used PayPal in a while, and I recall why. When the money is received it gets stuck for another 24h, sending error message with no explanation if you try to get it before. The fees are awfully high, to receive and transfer. It takes 10 DAYS to transfer the money from PayPal to you bank accounts. I do not recommend that app for money transferred",
            "Needs to support Face unlock, still unsupported as of October 2020. Update: It's not possible to log in when trying to auto fill the password as it auto closes the pop up and the password does not get to be filled in the field. Haven't seen it happen in any of my other apps, only in PayPal. I am now forced to sign in via the web version which actually works.",
            "I like the app, however, it would be nice if it would save my preferred login method, such as Fingerprint scan, because everytime I open the app, it asks me if I want to set up fingerprint scanning, which I do, but it asks every single time to set it up, even though I have it saved in my account login and security preferences. Also, this is more of a wish and not an bug/glitch it would be cool if we could pay on the PayPal mastercard balance before the statement is sent in the app. :Fixed now:"

Next one, back flips. I did several back flips & only one was counted. Did it again & still, only one had been counted. Repeated the process again & same result. Hope I have helped in some way to resolve the problem. Thank you & have a great day",
            "I started playing this years ago only because my friends were playing it in high school and I remembered it being really fun. Especially just trying to beat each others highscores and trying different cars to comeplete stages. Its so nice to see that the game still has so many downloads and still has its charm as it did back then. Addictive gameplay, smooth, simple but yet beautiful graphics (looks and feels good on a bigger screen device), fun progression and also completely free to play.",
            "This is a really nice game. But the idea of havingbto start from the beginning every time is really bad. There should be lives or check points. If you die,you start where you died. You can do this maybe only twice,then from there you have to start from the beginning again. Starting over n over makes me not wanna play anymore",
            "Great app with a great features there are. So much entertainment in it it is the one of the great feature of this game. This game is good no ads in it is also a good feature in the game new cars are good and improved . That is why I love the game there are new and entertaining paths and ways I like the game very much thee are no glitches in the game ( app. ) . This is also quite funny when the man sitting in the car dies this is a great app. I have a great experience.",
            "Overall i love this game. The graphics, and ease of play is relsly good. Ive been playing it for ages and i did get really far at one point until i lost all my data before saving it.

They also need to add more stages because once you get far enough into the game you just repeat previous levels. I have seen every level at least 3 times each. But the overall gameplay and idea is amazing, and the repeating levels dont bother me much, which is why i am 2000 levels into the game. 3/5",
            "TOO MANY ADS. I like the gameplay but an ad every 10 secs (some even un-skippable) kind of breaks the flow and makes a good game disengaging.

            "Though the features of zoom is really awesome. I am unhappy to give it 4 stars due to the same video issue. Many people are facing the same problem like me I guess. When my video is on and I go to the participants list, it shows that my video is off. Even the other people cant see my video. That creates a great problem to me during online classes. Please find out a solution to solve this problem. I hope the next updates will make me rate zoom 5 starts.",
            "So yeah, I've facing this problem for 1 month or 2. First it worked good both in mobile and in laptop/computer but now, mobile is facing problem. However, there are 2 problems. 1. It lags so much when my network is excellent and it lags the other apps too. 2. When I switch tabs on my mobile during a meeting, the camera automatically gets switched off and I've been facing this problem from a month or 2. Please fix these problems and I can have a peaceful meeting.",
            "It's a nice app 🙂 it works nicely but the video camera settings is worst . Whenever I use zoom I always turn up my brightness full but this app always show my video null .So I want you to try to fix it . And then zoom is perfect for getting 5 stars. Try to fix it as soon as possible. I hope so you can do it.",
            "This is one of the worst apps. I have used this app for online classes. There are many problems during online classes. The voice of the other participants does not come through clearly in the entire meeting. This app drains the battery very fast. It takes a lot of internet to work. If the network is good even then it does not work perfectly. If I want to open my front camera and unmute myself then I am unable to do these things. The functions in this app are good but the performance is worst",
            "Worked great until for some reason my password was no longer accepted and regarded as invalid. I clicked on \"Forgot Password\" to receive an email that would let me change the password to a new one, but it sent me useless links that lead me to practically nowhere as it says, \"log in to access this page\". Seriously? I clicked \"Forgot Password\" for a reason. If I ask for a password reset, send me what I ask for and not links that lead me to practically nowhere. I missed a lot of important meetings"

            "Experience on the flipkart app has been good. It's user friendly. But 1 thing I would like to add for the development team, when we use certain set of filters and want to see any product let's say listed on number 10 and when we click on the back button, the app takes us to the starting of the page and it takes a alot of efforts and time to reach back to the desired product. This should be rectified.",
            "Best app I have ever seen.Better then Amazon and other shopping applications I am very happy with this app. I have order several times and I get every product safe and as shown in photos. This thing is good.But I only think the problem is that it take a long time in delivery. So I request decrease the delivery time and then its the perfect apk ever made and get 5 🌟 full ratings keep it up.",
            "It's an outstanding app and the best thing is that the products are really good, it appears the same as shown in the app. All products are of good price. I have been using Flipkart from an interval and I am very satisfied with it. And customer care services are really good, they give a very good response, they understand and they accept the issue. It's a beautiful shopping app. Love you Flipkart",
            "App is superb, the filtering works much better than amazon (as there are more parameters). Just a few hiccups: 1. Ocassionally notification bell icon would show a large number of notifications, but when I click on them, there are none. 2. Flipkart original videos cannot be played:( 3. There should be an easier way to switch among multiple user accounts like Amazon allows.",
            "FLIPKART = A Beautiful Neatly Arranged App. Vibrant Blue Color, Bold Text. Neatly Organized Categories. Millions Of Products Available. Real Product Photos, Specifications, Dimensions. Easy To Understand. Language Options Are Available. Bold & Clear Notification. All Payment Methods Are Allowed. Easy Cancellations, Exchanges, Returns & Refunds. Friendly Customer Service. I Love Flipkart."

Again, I enjoy this app but l'm just tired of looking for ways to answer clearly and that the questionaire with understand it more because of the problem. Thank you for this application",

You might not get ur answer some times so u can post a question and get an answer from other users. So you should definitely try this app. It will really help you alot🏆📖📚📑🎒",
            "The old version was very useful. But this one is not user friendly. Audio questions are only in hindi, if i ask in english it started to type in Hindi . And also the scan and solve option is also not working correctly, if i ask a question, it is diverting to other questions. The old version was very useful. I don't know what is happening in the new version.",
            "The app is awesome. The problem is with the latest version of android. There is a bug. Eveytime i work with formula tab, the app crashes. Also you can make improvements towards making inserting formulas much more easily and conveniently. The idea of app is good . I myself contributed answers. Please fix this issue as soon as possible in next update at earliest.",

When I searched on Google for one of my questions, I found this app. I downloaded it and it is amazing!

            "It's a great app so far but I have run into a slight issue with renaming songs. It seems like if you rename any songs you have downloaded with apps other than samsung music, it doesn't pick up on it. For example, if I have songnameA and I rename it to songnameB, it shows songnameB in the folder but in the app it doesn't change and is still songnameA. In the recently added section however, it shows songnameB, but as soon as I add it to a playlist it changes back to songnameA.",
            "This really is a good music app. It's simple, clean (mostly), user friendly, and not glitchy. I'd only change 2 things, but they bug me enough to drop rating 1 star each. #1 PLEASE add the option to list multiple, separate, Artists and Genres in 'edit Track Details'?! There is one line to list any & all, but if I add 2(+) names or a 'feat', the track won't show up under each artist, only the 2(+) names together. #2 NEED 'Do Not Show Again' box on irritating SiriusXM ad when app starts up.",
            "I have championed this app along with the very polished Internet and email apps Samsung makes. It is smooth, snappy, has good sound, is simple and light. But... Ads... They bothered me for a while, but I'm just learning to suck it up and deal with it. It's a couple of clicks every now and again. It's still the best in terms of functionality playing my local files. I like it's dark theme and generally feels intuitive. One star off because it would still be better without ads.",
            "As of the last three updates this app has been the bug central. The worst of any music apps I've used. The welcome ads; freezing before playing a song; long pauses before deleting a playlist or removing a song from a playlist. What gives? It was never like this before. I wish there was an option to reset it to factory settings. I'll be looking for a new app today.",
            "I had to move to this app because Google play shut down & YouTube music is garbage. It's alright. I can add music to some magical queue but somehow cannot look to see what's in said queue. It's good to make playlists & listen to music on random. However, unlike google play, when I put all my music on random I cant see a queue so I have no clue what's next, cant change my queue, and I dont like that. Unlike google play I cant swipe to the next song, I have to hit next, so in the car is not good."

For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf.

Today I use a low end Android phone with Android 8.1 Go edition. Unfortunately I don't get the reliable experience I got from the above mentioned phones. I think OM is trying to fix something that is not broken and got everything messed up in the process. I would like to have the old reliable OM back. Thank you",
            "I found it better than chrome. I was using chrome before but recently when you browse for list of movies in chrome their new format is very inconvenient. Also when I start to download a file chrome don't show any download progress, in fact it doesn't even show if the file is being downloaded or not. Very frustrating. So I went on to play store in search of another browser and stumbled upon opera browser. Downloaded it and what do you know, first time lucky. Love it.",

A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King. \r\n\r\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees).

            "My favourite game for best time - pass, all things is good but one thing make me very sad, I had purchased a Product from the given add in Ludo King that's become fraud.. There was options only to online tv payment that's why bi credited, more than 15 days over but not till one Email/Sms/Call not Came.. till I was watching , i wase also email the company but not responded... If i don't get the product i will Record a FIR in the police station in the name if Ludo King.. Why u promote like this..",
            "I've been getting kicked out of games left, right and center. When I go back it sets me up with a new game and doesn't let me in on the one that I had started playing. I end up losing coins like crazy. I was upto almost a 950k and now I'm down to almost 800k. Also, the ads that should show up in order to earn coins never show up (this is for the button on the left bottom corner). Please resolve these issues ASAP.",
            "Update: my phone isn't heating up now. Why is my phone heating up? My phone gets hot when I play and my battery drains a lot. This is not a game that needs lot of processing or graphics like a car race or a first person shooter game. Something is fishy. Are the phones resources used for something else in the background? I also noticed my battery draining when I opened the app but not started a game yet. Waiting for your reply.",
            "The dice rolled by script not randomized. You will never have 6 for three times consecutively. In reality it should be possible! The other one is, your token will never occupy the same position together in the same cell except in the safe place (starred or coloured). Based on that, I assume that you will be majority lost except you do some in-game purchasing. The more money you put in the game,the more probability that you will win the game. Deserve 1 star only!",
            "This app is fixed. If it is random, why would first you lose 5 matches and then win 5. Please don't believe them. Even if you mail them, they won't reply. Ultimately you will win 10 matches but you will lose 100 matches. They are making fool of you because money is involved here and they also know it. Don't download. Sorry but there is not a option for 0 star."

            "This app is very nice! I just got to know about it from an advertisement, and I'm not dissapointed at all. All the filters are very realistic and amazing! This app definitely deserves more hype. Does not take as much storage as other apps and, whenever you click a pic or take a video, it saves it directly to your gallery, so you don't have to export it. I am very satisfied. Would recommend this app!",
            "B612 is really an awesome app for filters, photos, video shoots, and everything.... it has the best filters.... It is not less than \"tiktok\"... I like shooting videos but no posting... so I just shoot them on B612, with the awesome filters and music... the only think that must be improved is that the music search must be there..... And everything is really awesome... 😍😍",
            "Full support excellent application for photos and videos. A Minor thing I downloaded all the stuff in this app like effects,stickers,make ups and what not everything went good until last update. I updated B612 and guess what everything I had downloaded was gone and has to be downloaded again.And sometimes when I open the app it presents me with a blank screen and I have to restart.One more thing there are bugs and several options which wouldnt work.Like the hair colour changer for instance.",
            "I am very happy after using this app but i have rated it 4 stars cuz i got one problem. I do some editings with this app. It would have been better if there was video merging option and text writing in videos. I will rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed in the next update.",
            "Plz add separate slides for makeup..means it must be separate for lipsticks,highlight your face,blush on...when I want to highlight only MN face ,to look natural,dark coloured lipstick has been applied which is so so irritating.please consider that...if we want to only highlight face but don't want any lipstick,than what will we do? And also add good highlighters for face!"

            "It is OK ish, with basic functions available to phones for years missing. Speed dial contacts on home screen. Once a norm, now hard to find. Google contacts will give option to add a contact to home screen, but it omits the option to make it a speed / direct dial action. It only opens that contact in the app... The whole point of sending a contact to home page is for this reason, to be able to directly dial key contacts. Please implement this feature. Now that google contacts for various reasons are becoming the default app, instead of an option, with native contact apps missing (like in recent Xiaomi phones which did have this feature) there is even more urge to add this functionality"

            "Full of bugs, why replace a working app with this? Too many bugs to cover. Volume drops until the app decides to randomly pause. When expanding from letterbox to fullscreen, the aspect stays in full screen untill it pauses randomly, then, when play is pressed it stretches across the x axis, leaving the black border of letterbox while stretching horizontally. On top of that, I have never had a smooth experience trying to download and of my 250+ purchases.... Wifi or cellular",
            "Just installed itself one day. I can't uninstall and if I try and put it in a folder the next time I open my phone it always reappears somewhere else on my screen. I don't need ANOTHER streaming service. Y'all already rich, you don't need another app, especially since I didnt want the app to begin with, nor did I approve its download.",
            "One thing that I like about it is that I can limit my searches to only \"free\" movies, so it limits it to my current subsctriptions, but it would be nice if you could do that same limitation when browsing by genre. I have so many subscriptions, I'd like to limit my browsing to those subscriptions. Also, how is YouTube TV not one of the supported services? You're literally the same company!",
            "Disappointed! This review is for the Google TV dongle. I was excited about it. But it hasn't lived up to expectations. My biggest drawback is the lack of \"Continue watching\" on most apps. This device was supposed to consolidate all of my contents in one place but it doesn't. I hope an update can rectify it. The outlay and ability to disable contents from apps one doesn't use will be great.",
            "I like the upgrade, but when I'm offline, it doesn't want to show my TV show library. Instead, it says \"Start your own collection\". I already have a collection. It can show me my movie library, but not my TV show library. It doesnt even show the content I've already downloaded to watch offline, unless I get connected to the internet to do so."

Honestly screw google play games forcing me to re-enable it even though I didn't need before and to update it on the little space I have left on my phone. You're a waste of time and stop me from playing the games I love.",
            "I liked it until today. Today I found some sort of glitch that some of the games I played, it said that they were played 1st January 1970 for some reason AND NO MATTER WHAT I DID IT STAYED LIKE THAT!!!! I found it absolutely ANNOYING and I need you to know about it and fix it, GOOGLE!!!!! >:(|",
            "Google Play games helps to save your progress in each game and when you uninstall and reinstall it, you can again play the game from where you left. But even after enabling automatic sign-in to the supported games, it's not connecting sometimes. We have to connect from the game. In the achievement section for each game, my achievements are not showing. Sometimes I am not able to connect with the supported games, I don't know why. Please fix this problems, also I'm finding bugs in the app.",

But now in this update you can play MORE different games, ADD friends, EARN achievements ( that was old lol) but still. Look how much it offers you! It's incredible, It's one of the apps that you can actually never get bored of. Good job developers, I'm more than surprised!! :))",
            "Loved what this app was doing until I had to get a new phone. Now some of the games I've played lost all the progress I made in them because my profile no longer exists even though I never deleted it and its under the same Gmail. It wants me to create a new one and doesn't offer a way to try and recover my original one. Typically would care but I invested a lot of time and a little money in marvels contest of champions and now its all gone."
