This is a really convenient app to log down your attacks and see the duration of each one and how often. It's hard to rely on memory alone or write when having an illness so this is a really quick way for me to record for all my doctor's.",
            "This used to be a 5 Star App, but some of the features are now only available if you pay a subscription. It also keeps sending me reminders about things I don't need. I know my triggers, I don't have scheduled upcoming dr appt cuz I don't have insurance. Please stop suggesting these things",
            "App is awesome and quite useful. Just a couple of cons: when selecting gender on our profile we don't have more than the binomial options and, also, it's be great to be able to customize the avatar at the main page (the one that tells you how much time you've been on or out of attack)",
            "Still crashes, required uninstall then reinstall to get it to work some. However, several times unable to save sleep notes after reinstall. Still broken on my Note 9 samsung phone.",

Because dark works better during the attack. I like it so far. I have a question though: does it have a report that you can look at? Sorry, couldn't figure it out. And I wanted so sign it, but not sure how beneficial it is? Help will be greatly appreciated.",

            "Great app but I have seen in some other comments how people were not happy about the logging of past headaches.... it is possible but they didn't know how to use it. I would like to see an improved version of the pain location. That for one headache you could logg in more than 1 pain evolution and add the time which would make the reading of the time line of the pain intensity more effective.",
            "It lost a lot of information I entered about a headache because I hit the wrong button. It has some features that are easy better than *migraine buddy* but in some cases the app is difficult to use. The developers should design it with the idea in mind that people with migraines might not be feeling or thinking the best when they fill out details in the app. It should be harder to lose details and data, easier to enter times and days, and easier to side scroll the timeline of symptoms to specific points and see where you're at. If you change the start time of a migraine it competent screws up the pain levels timeline."

            "I have been using Migraine Buddy for a long time and just decided to try a new one. That one offers more \"preloaded\" choices but I just realized that it actually doesn't matter because after a year of entries I have to click each one to see what I wrote. This app is EXACTLY what I have needed but never knew existed. It is 100x better, user friendly, has more pinpointed options, and I love the dashboard. Only glitch is active migraines button text is garbled. THANK YOU FOR THIS AWESOME APP! 5*s!",
            "I've been using the app for a few weeks now, just long enough to start getting feedback from it on my migraine trends. It's fairly easy to use. I would really like to be able to record headaches while offline, but I've had no success with that. Editing the pain location, medication use, and intensity is also very difficult if not done in real time - part of the reason that offline use would be great.",
            "I needed to track just how many headaches I was getting to try and pin point the triggers. I was very surprised to find I actually had headaches on a daily basis. This also will help my doctors to hopefully assist in getting rid of them",
            "I have an intractable chronic migraine and this is the first app that I have found where I can track a continuous migraine.",
            "Easy to use and insightful. Has helped me spot trends and possible triggers. Useful for providing information to my doctors for further treatment."

Its relatively simple to figure out and I like that I can add my own descriptors for pain/symptoms, location, and triggers. I wish there was a way to kind track possible triggers as I'm not always sure what has caused my migraines. However, I just list all the options possible for that migraine in particular in order to try and figure things out from there.",
            "Useless, tried it once and deleted it. (Better off using migraine buddy instead if u have migraines or diagnosed medical issues) This is completely pointless-for example, there are no migraine/headache medications listed under medications other than asprin, tea & coffee??? There are not even basic triggers listed under triggers. Completely and utterly useless.",
            "Seems to lack an important feature...or maybe I just don't know how to use it. I'm talking about recording the progression of a headache. For instance, it stars off as a three but within an hour, it's 6. But all you seem to be able to do is to change the number without keeping the old score, which means that your final record will show that all your headaches started as 6 and did not develop gradually. Please tell me if I missed something as otherwise the app is really easy to use and v. good",
            "I just used this app for the first time today. It was relatively easy to use and self-explanatory. However, at the end of the day I needed to edit that particular migraine and I could not find a way to edit what I had posted earlier in the day. 🙁",
            "I really like this app. It tracks my headaches, but I also keep track of what I eat every day to see if food might be a trigger. The only reason why I didn't give this app 5 stars is that I wish when I record a headache of 0 severity it would be counted as not a headache...otherwise a great app. Highly recommended!"

        "comments": [
            "I can definitely see the difference in tint of my screen when the filter is on and I like the notification bar widget that lets you control whether the filter is active with a single tap. It also only requires two permissions to draw over other apps and the OS to keep the whole screen changed and it's easy to schedule it to turn on. Although, the filter stops working after awhile and I'm not even sure if the schedule works or not.",
            "Easy to use and toggle. Unlike other apps I've tried, it has the option to keep the on and off option at the top of the notification area so it is always accessible. I also like that it supports more than one intensity of overlay; having options is much nicer than not having options.",
            "Was the best night light filter out there but since I updated to Android 11 it bugs every time I watch a video on full-screen (the filter only covers a square in the center of the screen while two big sides of the screen so not have the filter). Other than that it works well. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, don't push premium on me every time I turn on the app, allow users to choose \"no, thank you\" instead of \"later\".",
            "Honestly, this is really a good app which helps us prevent the exposure of blue light of the screen for better eye health. But, sometimes all of sudden it stops working, especially when I open some apps like sticky notes, YouTube, VPN, etc, so I have to open this app and turn it on again. Rather inconvenience sometimes. I hope there will be some improvement about it. Thanks in advance :)",
            "Some bugs, like occasional it stops working, and when setting up a new filter it will revert to full brightness during the set up, but potentially this could be one of the best blue filter programs I've tried. I have light or medium on during the day and dark at night. It would be nice to be able to set up a schedule for this. You can set up your own filters too, or adjust the pre-sets to get it how you want it."

I have been looking for something like this for a long time.",

It appears to assume you're logging after a migraine has happened and that they don't last for more than 24 hours when in fact some last for days or even weeks. Additionally it assumes that medications are only used as an abortive measure instead of as maintenance to prevent. Will be seeking an app that better fits my migraine patterns with more in depth tracking abilities.",

Available on Apple and Android, in English and French.<br><br><b>Here are five good reasons to keep a diary:</b><br>• Get a clear idea of your headache frequency and patterns<br>• Use the data to work with your health care provider<br>• Monitor the response to treatments (acute, preventive, behavioral)<br>• Observe triggers <br>• Watch medication overuse <br>• Bonus: detect menstrual migraine! <br><b>Less is more: simple, focused and designed to optimize your discussions with your health care provider</b><br><br>You can monitor what is important for you: headache frequency but also triggers, symptoms and medication response. <br><br>We built this tool to make communication with your health care provider (family doctor, neurologist, nurse practitioner, pharmacist etc) easier. The App focuses on the information usually discussed with physicians. Our reports can be sent to your health care provider in two convenient ways: PDF and email. <br><br>We hope that you will find this application convenient and easy to use!

            "Can't enter what time you took medication. Who doesn't need to know that? It's also very slow, like it is syncing after each thing you enter instead of after you've finished an entry. I did like that I could turn off tracking for all the things I don't need to make it quicker and easier to use when I have a migraine, but without being able to track medication, it is of no use to me.",
            "The notes section is horrible. It always says \"something went wrong\" when I try to save my notes. So frustrating, especially after I write and then I cannot save them. How is this supposed to help me when I cannot even go back and read my notes? Notes are really important when trying to track my migraines! I only use this app because of my neurologist. I used migraine buddy app before and never had this issue.",
            "Overall a good app, but there are a few limitations which need to be improved: 1) No capability to track actual mg or # pills taken for preventative or acute medications 2) The \"Get Report\" function doesn't pull in all of the acute medications listed in your profile (for me it pulled in 5 of 11) which defeats the purpose of the report 3) The \"Get Report\" function automatically checks \"Aura\" off for every day you have a migraine and includes \"Menstruation\" even if you aren't tracking that",
            "Very useful app, there are some issues with it that others have mentioned. One quality of life improvement would be to remove the Ok dialogue box after setting a migraine free day. There should be no confirmation dialogue box as the day has a visual colour change.",
            "It's pretty good. The impacts on your day only talks about work so doesn't apply to us retired folks as well. Perhaps some additional descriptors would help. Also my attacks kind of wax and wane throughout their 3to 4 day duration. I hadn't thought of each recurrence as a new attack but I can record them that way I guess. Also I have postdrome that lasts for a day or 2 and would love to be able to track those symptoms, treatments, activities that help etc. Love to have this record!"

There are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being (including improved control of headache and migraine).

So I basically could not complete set up because it's different everytime. My headaches don't always start on the left side, throb, at about a 6 for example. You should be able to choose these details at the time of the event that you are logging, not beforehand. Unfortunately I will be deleting 😔"

The Raag Darbari works to relieve my head, however the Raag Ramkali does not. On a side note, some of these sitar tunes remind me of The Beatles Help album where there is a really upbeat sitar tune that always puts me in a good mood. Maybe the sitar has a gift. I wish I understood it more. Anyway, THANK YOU developers for the app and the relief it has brought me. Many thanks!"

I've only ever had one (ONE) alert come through notifications since I started using this a couple years ago. and again, yes. the settings are all correct. i use the app to monitor chronic pain, but it's useless now.",
            "Great app, I've always been fascinated by air pressure, no idea why but I've tracked it on the BBC weather for years. Now I have a barometer in my pocket, a log of data and it all plotted on a chart. Minus one star because the notifications bear little resemblance to the recorded data! Like zero use whatsoever it's comical. Update: I now have 6 months of data and my graph is looking rather cluttered. It would be good to archive this data and start again afresh",
            "My migraines can be triggered by weather changes so I paid for the full features, set up My Places and set up Alerts - but the Alerts don't ever come through and they aren't saved anywhere so you can't check. Think I've been sold a lemon. **all fixed, thanks!**",

        "description": "Relieve Migraine Headaches Naturally\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many new migraine headache treatments available that can be both safe and effective. Natural treatments for migraine headaches are usually safer and cheaper than traditional pain medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in many instances they can relieve pain just as well or even better than prescription or non-prescription drugs. The possibility of a negative reaction to a safe and natural migraine headache treatment is still there, but it is less with most natural treatment methods than it is with pain-relieving medications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person on the face of the earth is unique. Their body chemistry is different than anyone else’s. One person may find relief from their migraine headaches with one type of treatment while someone else may try that same treatment and find no relief at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo two people will experience the same reaction from the same treatment. But why is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body is made up of a mixture of chemicals. Every person produces certain chemicals in their body so that they will be able to function at their best. Histamines will increase gastric secretion and dilate the capillaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsulin is secreted by the pancreas and helps regulate the blood sugar levels. Hormones are produced by the body for many different functions. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is produced in response to stress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery body is unique and produces different chemicals in differing amounts. When a person takes aspirin (a chemical) for their migraine headaches it changes the chemical make-up of that person’s body. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou’ve always heard that when two chemicals, in the same amounts, at the same temperature, etc. are mixed together they will cause the same reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat may be true, but when one chemical (such as aspirin) is taken by two separate people their reactions will never be exactly the same because no two people have identical chemicals in their body. One person taking aspirin will not have the same reaction as someone else taking aspirin. And it’s the same with natural migraine headache treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince no two people are identical no two people will respond exactly the same to a treatment method for migraine headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo just because one migraine headache treatment does not work for one person does not mean it won’t work for your migraine headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many effective alternatives to taking medications when it comes to relieving migraine headaches. You just have to try one for yourself to see if it will work for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne natural and popular treatment method for migraine headaches is chiropractic care, or chiropractic manipulations. Studies have shown that over 80% of headache patients find some type of relief for their headaches with chiropractic treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd chiropractic treatment has been shown to be extremely safe. Spinal problems cause headaches and when these spinal problems are treated by chiropractors a high percentage of their patients experience relieve from their pain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother natural way to relieve migraine headaches is biofeedback. This is a safe and potentially effective way to eliminate pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiofeedback is not actually a treatment, but a training program designed to help a person develop the ability to control their autonomic (involuntary) nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions that are normally automatic in the body, such as blood pressure regulation or heart rate can be controlled voluntarily. This technique makes it possible for a person to control their own heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature or relaxation of their muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s no secret that stress causes muscle tension. And nobody will deny that muscle tension causes pain and headaches. And it’s also a fact that by relaxing this muscle tension, especially in the neck and head, it is possible to relieve the migraine headaches or neck pain that is being caused by the tension.",

            "I tried using this app about a year ago, and it was very rigid for being a social app. Other social apps are more encompassing, having a place where you can post to everyone and anyone, others then scroll through the homepage of these posts to easily see who is around & who they relate to. There's usually also a feature to search for friends by age, gender & country which is very helpful in finding someone to comfortably connect with. This app lacks those features as well as private chat. :/",
            "Every time I try to go on even after uninstalling and installing it I keep getting a error fetching error...",
            "It's a great idea, except you need to be 18 to use it. I'm not sure why since a lot of social media has the age limit at 13 (I'm 16), so I would like to know the reasoning behind it. I was excited to use this app since a lot media seems to cater to adults that suffer from migraines, and I usually can't relate because of that. I thought this would be a great for possibly connecting with others in my age group, but I guess not."

            "Content is great... When I can access it. If I pause a recording it is very hard to get out to open again. I have to try repeatedly and don't know if it will work. I've given up and read the transcripts for some things but that doesn't work well for a meditation. Please fix these bugs!",
            "I think this is a brilliant app and my pain is so much more manageable after only a month. My reason for only giving 4 stars is that an awful lot of the work is going back to childhood. I have done years of therapy and I just don't need this so a lot of exercises etc are useless to me. Some brain training exercises and the somatic taking is really helpful... Building new neural pathways.",
            "As a musician, RSI has had a significant effect on me for years and finally now I'm able to play again. The app works on the premise that after the source of pain has healed, the sensation can remain because the brain gets stuck in a pain loop, exacerbated by anxiety and anticipation of the pain. The app is based on valid (and relatively recent) research and I'm delighted to say it has worked for me. Thank you Curable.",
            "Great concept but app needs some fixing I love curable and what they do. The content is great but sometimes my meditations stop playing somewhere half way and it ruins the whole meditation experience. Another thing is sometimes the shortcut for the meditation will stay on my drop-down in which nothing will make it disappear unless I restart my phone. Just a bug I'm assuming hopefully the developers fix this",
            "This app may help you. You will need to be able to tune your body to certain unknown frequencies and believe that the MRI study they refer to was not a flawed study from the start. If you are easily brainwashed this is the app for you. Worth a try if you are in constant pain. Good luck."

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",

        "description": "Millions of people suffer from painful migraines. So, what can you do when an excruciating migraine strikes all of a sudden? Following are some great home remedies for migraine headaches that you can apply quickly and get fast relief.\r\n\r\nA migraine is an acute headache that is extremely painful and can even be a disabling condition for many. Migraines are common among the population as a whole. In the U.S., 18% of women and 6% of men report having had at least one migraine headache in the past year. Migraines affect about 30 million people in the United States. They may occur at any age, but usually begin between the ages of 10 and 40 and may begin to diminish after age 50. Some people experience several migraines a month, while others have only a few migraines throughout their lifetime. Approximately 75% of all migraine sufferers are women.\r\n\r\nSome people complain that visual problems accompany their migraines. These visual symptoms include; bright shimmering lights around objects or at the edges of the field of vision, zigzag lines, wavy images, or hallucinations.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms may include severe pain in the area of the temples, around the eyes or in the back of the head. In addition, migraines may be accompanied by nausea, fatigue or tiredness, and mood changes a day or two preceding the headache.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, migraines appear to run in families. If one of your parents suffered with migraines, there is a good chance that you will get them too.\r\n\r\nSo, what events trigger severe migraines? In most cases, migraines are brought on by the following triggers; stress, anxiety, fatigue, certain medications, alcohol and certain foods. Monosodium glutamate (also know as MSG), is thought to be a factor in the cause of severe migraines for a number of people. MSG is frequent used ingredient in Chinese and Asian cuisine.\r\n\r\nConventional home remedies for migraine headaches focus on trigger avoidance and symptom control. If you find that eating certain foods or situations are frequently followed by a migraine, avoid it in the future. This is common sense, but many people do not make the connection between the two occurrences.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches is moderation in your consumption of alcohol and caffeine. These are common triggers. Home remedies for migraine headaches should also include getting adequate sleep, eating meals at regular intervals, and drinking plenty of fluids. Dehydration is also a very common trigger for severe migraines.\r\n\r\nMassage therapies are often very effective forms of home remedies for migraine headaches. If you feel a migraine coming on, get a massage. Headaches and severe migraines are frequently caused by stress. When you are stressed, your muscles tighten up. A massage works to delicately stretch these tight muscles and help alleviate the accumulated stress in your body. By working the muscles in your neck and shoulders, as well as those at the base of the skull, muscles relax and the discomfort will be eliminated. Ideally, this technique works best if someone else does it for you but, if that is not an option, it is possible to give yourself a neck and head massage. A massage is one my personal favorite home remedies for migraines.\r\n\r\nSome people get some relief by applying either a cold or warm compress to the effected area. Most people report that a cold compress works best, but if that is not effective, try a warm compress.\r\n\r\nAcupressure is also one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches. Like acupuncture, it is a well-known alternative treatment for many medical problems that has been used for thousands of years. To get headache pain relief, squeeze the fleshy area between your thumb and forefinger for at least five minutes for one of the quick remedies for migraines. Many folks also can relieve migraine pain by gently rubbing [using small circular motions] the little indentations just in front of your ears.",

        "description": "Millions of people suffer from painful migraines. So, what can you do when an excruciating migraine strikes all of a sudden? Following are some great home remedies for migraine headaches that you can apply quickly and get fast relief.\r\n\r\nA migraine is an acute headache that is extremely painful and can even be a disabling condition for many. Migraines are common among the population as a whole. In the U.S., 18% of women and 6% of men report having had at least one migraine headache in the past year. Migraines affect about 30 million people in the United States. They may occur at any age, but usually begin between the ages of 10 and 40 and may begin to diminish after age 50. Some people experience several migraines a month, while others have only a few migraines throughout their lifetime. Approximately 75% of all migraine sufferers are women.\r\n\r\nSome people complain that visual problems accompany their migraines. These visual symptoms include; bright shimmering lights around objects or at the edges of the field of vision, zigzag lines, wavy images, or hallucinations.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms may include severe pain in the area of the temples, around the eyes or in the back of the head. In addition, migraines may be accompanied by nausea, fatigue or tiredness, and mood changes a day or two preceding the headache.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, migraines appear to run in families. If one of your parents suffered with migraines, there is a good chance that you will get them too.\r\n\r\nSo, what events trigger severe migraines? In most cases, migraines are brought on by the following triggers; stress, anxiety, fatigue, certain medications, alcohol and certain foods. Monosodium glutamate (also know as MSG), is thought to be a factor in the cause of severe migraines for a number of people. MSG is frequent used ingredient in Chinese and Asian cuisine.\r\n\r\nConventional home remedies for migraine headaches focus on trigger avoidance and symptom control. If you find that eating certain foods or situations are frequently followed by a migraine, avoid it in the future. This is common sense, but many people do not make the connection between the two occurrences.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches is moderation in your consumption of alcohol and caffeine. These are common triggers. Home remedies for migraine headaches should also include getting adequate sleep, eating meals at regular intervals, and drinking plenty of fluids. Dehydration is also a very common trigger for severe migraines.\r\n\r\nMassage therapies are often very effective forms of home remedies for migraine headaches. If you feel a migraine coming on, get a massage. Headaches and severe migraines are frequently caused by stress. When you are stressed, your muscles tighten up. A massage works to delicately stretch these tight muscles and help alleviate the accumulated stress in your body. By working the muscles in your neck and shoulders, as well as those at the base of the skull, muscles relax and the discomfort will be eliminated. Ideally, this technique works best if someone else does it for you but, if that is not an option, it is possible to give yourself a neck and head massage. A massage is one my personal favorite home remedies for migraines.\r\n\r\nSome people get some relief by applying either a cold or warm compress to the effected area. Most people report that a cold compress works best, but if that is not effective, try a warm compress.\r\n\r\nAcupressure is also one of the good home remedies for migraine headaches. Like acupuncture, it is a well-known alternative treatment for many medical problems that has been used for thousands of years. To get headache pain relief, squeeze the fleshy area between your thumb and forefinger for at least five minutes for one of the quick remedies for migraines. Many folks also can relieve migraine pain by gently rubbing [using small circular motions] the little indentations just in front of your ears.",

Headaches are one of the most common problems people face in the modern world. In fact, migraines rank as the 19th most common cause for disability.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do about it?\r\n\r\nHaving severe headaches interfere with your ability to work and play. It’s time you found relief from your headache. Even if you suffer from occasional headaches, it’s time you found out what the exact cause is so you can find the perfect treatment!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to headaches, you will find that it is a condition that will be painful in the head, neck, and even back area. You will need to understand that the headache is not always just a pain. It could mean a sign of some sort and you will need to see a doctor if you get a lot of headaches. When it comes to symptoms or being a sign, you will need to consider that it is very rarely anything but a headache, but you will want to see a doctor if the headaches are persistent. \r\n\r\nAs for causes for the headaches, you will find that it could be tension, eye strain, low blood sugar, sinuses, and even dehydration. You will also find that it could be a symptom of some life-threatening conditions like high blood pressure, brain tumors, and meningitis. You will also get a headache if you are injured in the head. Head trauma is very serious and you should seek medical treatment. You will also notice that the headache could simply be a part of your menstrual cycle, because you are fluctuating in estrogen levels. \r\n\r\nAs for treatment you will be able to take some of the over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen or aspirin. This will help you to get rid of the headache, but you will want to avoid some of your triggers, if you are able to identify them. Things like stress and even particular foods should be avoided in order for you to avoid having a headache. You will also want to seek medical attention if you feel that your headaches are persistent.\r\n\r\nMost of your headaches are going to be nothing at all, however, you will still want to get checked out so that you can avoid having it manifest into something that is very serious. You will need to keep in mind that you will want to keep a headache journal. This way you can identify if you just have some specific trigger. Often your headaches will mean nothing, but it is always safe to jot down what you were doing when you got the headache and rather or not you have anything in common with other headaches. This way you can simply avoid the food or activity that makes you get headaches.",

You will also notice that the headache could simply be a part of your menstrual cycle, because you are fluctuating in estrogen levels. <br><br>As for treatment you will be able to take some of the over-the-counter painkillers like Ibuprofen or aspirin. This will help you to get rid of the headache, but you will want to avoid some of your triggers, if you are able to identify them. Things like stress and even particular foods should be avoided in order for you to avoid having a headache. You will also want to seek medical attention if you feel that your headaches are persistent.<br><br>Most of your headaches are going to be nothing at all, however, you will still want to get checked out so that you can avoid having it manifest into something that is very serious. You will need to keep in mind that you will want to keep a headache journal. This way you can identify if you just have some specific trigger. Often your headaches will mean nothing, but it is always safe to jot down what you were doing when you got the headache and rather or not you have anything in common with other headaches. This way you can simply avoid the food or activity that makes you get headaches.",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

Therefore it comes as no surprise that those affected frequently reach for painkillers. However, this can have serious consequences, because the frequent use of painkillers may result in drug-induced headaches - a true vicious circle!\r\n\r\nAlternative methods are often more effective and efficient for getting rid of the annoying pain of headaches and migraines - especially in the long term! They not only relieve the pain, but also treat the problem at its source. One example is the hypnosis program \"Get Migraine-Free! Headache and migraine relief by Hypnosis\".\r\n\r\n\"Get Migraine-Free!\" is based on the healing power of hypnosis and supports the relaxation process which is particularly essential for the treatment of headaches and migraines. It works like this: your subconsciousness activates your „inner doctor“, the awareness of your own needs raises and you learn to listen to your own rhythm again - with noticeably successful results! \r\n\r\nTension disappears from the blood vessels in your head, irritability diminishes, frustration over the constant pain fades away and exhaustion is replaced by targeted relaxation. Special voice patterns and goal-oriented suggestions lead the psychotherapy practitioner through a visualization process which allows the body and mind to relax. The music developed for this programme promotes the relaxing effects of hypnosis and contributes to the success of the audio program.\r\n\r\nABOUT KIM FLECKENSTEIN\r\n\r\n„Get Migraine-free!“ was designed by well-known German Hypnotherapist Kim Fleckenstein. Kim Fleckenstein is a certified alternative practitioner in psychotherapy, a clinical Hypnotherapist and NLP-Master-Coach. Based in Munich she already published a range of best-selling self-help and hypnosis programs as Apps and MP3s under the label GET ON APPS!. Her unique technique and self experiences have helped to create the special character and heart of her recordings. Together with professional and native speaker Cathy Weber she also publishes her programs in English.\r\n\r\nThis special hypnosis program was developed in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Ralf Herwig according to the latest knowledge of medicine and hypnotherapy. Prof. Dr. Ralf Herwig is Head of the Andrology and Urology Department at the Vienna General Hospital.\r\n\r\nWHAT YOU GET\r\n\r\n• A highly effective 25-Minute professional Hypnosis session using the latest hypnotic and relaxation techniques – suitable for both, beginners and more experienced users.\r\n• The professional and warm voice of Cathy Weber, which leads you into a deep state of relaxation and change.\r\n• A high quality and state of the art recording.\r\n• Professionally composed background music for every program by CSW Music.\r\n• Customize your settings and discover other useful features.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n\r\nDo not listen to this program while operating a motor vehicle or during any other activity that requires your full attention.

And if you are like me it never fully goes away. It just gets worse, goes down to bearable, then shoots back up. You can't even record ANYTHING!  No triggers, no symptoms, no medications used, nothing useful. You may as well use a stopwatch because that's what this is. Uninstalling!!",

            "Useful app and I use it every night. It is very helpful when I can't get to sleep. I would risk waking up the others with the glare from my un-dimmed screen I would pay 10 times over for the pro version. Thankfully, I only need pay a single time to receive the benefit of this app which allows me to use my phone without waking the creatures in my home who are frequently bothersome or dangerous in the night. Best blue light blocker ever has been godsend buy it and support the developers. Yes!",
            "Truly life-changing for those with migraines! Instead of lying in the dark, with nothing to do but think about how much your head hurts, you can actually use your devices even through the worst of the migraine. I turn on the Med setting with the first symptoms and change to Dark mode as they get worse. If you buy the app, there's a super dark mode; I rarely need it, but if you tend to have severe light sensitivity, you'll probably want it. Overall, this is the single best app I've ever gotten.",

They can, more often than not, be treated more effectively and without the need for medication. This type of treatment usually involves looking at your lifestyle and learning a few natural healing techniques that can have amazing results.",

And cicles, well, it's the fourth time that I'm about to complete a level and out of the blue and without any reason, it starts again as if I had skipped one day. So much of my time wasted. I consider that a scam. I had bet a lot on Bowhead. But If you handle things like that, well, I do not know.",

In response to the reply of the developer : I've taken that multiplier into account. In fact I continued for a while and saw that my estimation of increase of the multiplier was optimistic. It might take even longer.",

            "This app. actually works!It seems easy to use as well.I have tried another simple app and I had to install it because my phone didn't have the proper support.I don't think it was worth it even still.The one thing that I noticed with this app was it I have an error notice stating that there was a weak GPS signal,the same as another user. It's only a guess, but it's mine, that it's the app that's the problem.",
            "Not usable without location setting turned on and internet access, that's a problem if using where there is no internet. All I want is just indicate the freaking barometric pressure! Duh! False advertising.",
            "Far too plain and \"basic\" looking. (Not stylish at all); full-size app covers the whole screen and has NO widgets; doesn't support horizontal (Landscape) mode. And it repeatedly says: \"Weak GPS Signal\". What!!! (ALL my other apps show it as STRONG)! All in all, not a particularly interesting/useful app. Uninstalled.",
            "Works fine so far. Don't know if my smartphone has hardware for direct measurement of earth's local magnetic field strength in Teslas - this is in any case outside of the control of the (software) app - but I like that the magnetic field strength is displayed, & also both of magnetic north & true north. True north will require additional input, presumably from GPS satellites. App also helps me decide if smartwatch doing same thing is worth it, both practically & aesthetically. Good app, like it.",
            "The fact that you have the ability to adjust the offset and calibrate the barometer was the killer feature for me."

        "description": "Headaches happen. The good news is there are several simple things you can do to ease the pain without a trip to the doctor or drugstore. Try these tips and get to feeling better fast.\r\n\r\n1. Try a Cold Pack\r\nIf you have a migraine, place a cold pack on your forehead. Ice cubes wrapped in a towel, a bag of frozen peas, or even a cold shower may lessen the pain. Keep the compress on your head for 15 minutes, then take a break for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Use a Heating Pad or Hot Compress\r\nIf you have a tension headache, place a heating pad on your neck or the back of your head. If you have a sinus headache, hold a warm cloth to the area that hurts. A warm shower might also do the trick.\r\n3. Ease Pressure on Your Scalp or Head\r\nIf your ponytail is too tight, it could cause a headache. These \"external compression headaches\" can also be brought on by wearing a hat, headband, or even swimming goggles that are too tight. In one study, women who loosened their hair saw their headache disappear.\r\n\r\n4. Dim the Lights\r\nBright or flickering light, even from your computer screen, can cause migraine headaches. If you’re prone to them, cover your windows with blackout curtains during the day. Wear sunglasses outdoors. You might also add anti-glare screens to your computer and use daylight-spectrum fluorescent bulbs in your light fixtures.\r\n\r\n5. Try Not to Chew\r\nChewing gum can hurt not just your jaw, but your head as well. The same is true for chewing your fingernails, lips, the inside or your cheeks, or handy objects like pens. Avoid crunchy and sticky foods, and make sure you take small bites. If you grind your teeth at night, ask your dentist about a mouth guard. This may curb your early-morning headaches.\r\n\r\n6. Get Some Caffeine\r\nHave some tea, coffee, or something with a little caffeine in it. If you get it early enough, it could ease your headache pain. It can also help over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen, work better. Just don’t drink too much because caffeine withdrawal can cause its own type of headache.\r\n\r\nTOP PICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Practice Relaxation\r\nWhether it’s stretches, yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, learning how to chill out when you’re in the middle of a headache can help with the pain. You might even talk to your doctor about physical therapy if you have muscle spasms in your neck.\r\n\r\n8.Try Massage\r\nYou can do it yourself. A few minutes massaging your neck and temples can help ease a tension headache, which may result from stress.\r\n\r\n9. Take Some Ginger\r\nA small recent study found that taking ginger, in addition to regular, over-the-counter pain medicine, eased pain for people in the ER with migraines. Another found that it worked almost as well as prescription migraine medicine. You can try a supplement or maybe brew some tea.\r\n10. Take medicine in Moderation\r\nPharmacy shelves are stocked with pain relievers for all kinds of headaches. They may work, but to get the most benefit with the least risk, follow the directions on the label and these guidelines:\r\n\r\nChoose liquid over pills. Your body absorbs it faster.\r\nTake painkillers as soon as you feel pain. You’ll likely beat it with a smaller dose.\r\nIf you get sick to your stomach when you get a headache, ask your doctor what might help.\r\nAsk your doctor what to take to avoid a rebound headache -- pain that sets in after a few days of taking pain relievers.\r\nAnd be sure to talk to your doctor about what headache symptoms you should not try to treat at home.",

L’emicrania cronica è un sottotipo peculiare di emicrania che si associa ad un’elevata disabilità. L’emicrania cronica è una patologia che può migliorare con un trattamento medico adeguato. Il corretto inquadramento diagnostico del disturbo è alla base di qualunque terapia. Questa applicazione, attraverso alcune semplici domande ti permetterà di stabilire se la tua cefalea può essere una emicrania cronica.\r\n\r\nL’applicazione rappresenta uno strumento per permettere di identificare nella popolazione soggetti che, con elevata probabilità, potrebbero essere affetti da emicrania cronica. Ti saranno proposte delle domande sulla frequenza del mal di testa, sui sintomi che lo caratterizzano, sulla assunzione di farmaci antidolorifici e sull'impatto del tuo mal di testa sulla tua capacità di svolgere e fare programmi relativamente alle comuni attività di vita familiare, sociale e lavorativa. In base alle tue risposte, l’applicazione sarà in grado di identificare se la tua cefalea può essere un’emicrania cronica.\r\n\r\nTi sarà fornito un report delle risposte da te fornite e l’esito finale del questionario. Potrai condividere l’esito del questionario con il tuo medico di fiducia. Il questionario potrà essere di supporto al tuo medico per effettuare la diagnosi ed indirizzarti verso il percorso terapeutico più opportuno.\r\n\r\nL’emicrania cronica è una patologia curabile. Molti soggetti con emicrania cronica hanno anche un peggioramento della loro cefalea quale conseguenza dei farmaci che assumono per trattare il dolore. Esistono diverse terapie in grado di impattare in modo significato sul dolore. Le terapie disponibili includono: l’uso di farmaci specifici ed appropriati, la modificazione dello stile di vita, la rimozione di fattori scatenanti ed in alcuni casi terapie non farmacologiche. \r\n\r\nNota bene: Il risultato dell’applicazione non è in grado di supplire in alcun modo ad una visita medica completa e non permette di escludere la presenza di malattie strutturali quali causa della cefalea. Non si consiglia alcuna terapia come conseguenza del risultato di questa applicazione.

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

        "description": "Almost everyone has had a headache. Headache is the most common form of pain. It's a major reason people miss days at work or school or visit the doctor. The most common type of headache is a tension headache. Tension headaches are due to tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp and jaw. They are often related to stress, depression or anxiety. You are more likely to get tension headaches if you work too much, don't get enough sleep, miss meals, or use alcohol. According to Ellen Drexler, MD, director of the headache center at Maimonides Medical Center in New York City, \"Avoidance or management of stress, relaxation exercises, yoga, meditation, and other alternative medicine treatments can certainly be effective for many people, since stress is such a common headache trigger.\" According to guidelines published by the National Headache Foundation (NHF), once you have an accurate headache diagnosis and have been assured that your pain is not related to any other serious condition, your headache treatment can be improved by the addition of alternative therapies. Traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their headaches with alternative techniques. This app is an ultimate solution. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself.

            "Love the new update. There are a lot of new features. Might be confusing for most people as they tend to like the old version when it was simple and not as complex but the problem for me is the accuracy. The feature Looking Ahead, shows that there will be no rain within a 2-hour span but the Hourly tab says so otherwise. I don't really use the radar but it is very laggy for me. Overall, a fantastic app!",
            "Very disappointed and irritated with the update. I can't see the hourly at the top, the layouts changed to make it a pain in the ass, and I can't find a location with the map option anymore which was very helpful. Also the search for places sucks a lot now too, I can't even find Jasper, AB, really?! Even if I could only find it by using the map function that would be fine, but its gone so I can't. Just read your newer reviews and fix it, I would be very happy if you just withdrew this update.",
            "New version is a lot more cumbersome than the previous. More swipes needed to get to the same info. Really liked the previous version and was seriously considering getting the paid version to get longer forecast days. Now definitely not! Is there an option to reinstall the old version? Congratulations Accuweather! Somebody finally decided to take action about some of users numerous complaints. Unfortunately, only a few issues have been improved.",
            "Accuracy is poor. Forecasts are a crapshoot. Current conditions not always correct. Interface is overly complicated and unattractive to me. Widget doesn't keep itself current. I only keep using it because all the other weather apps I've tried are as bad or worse. I think the source material (nws, noaa,) has been affected by politics and reduced airline traffic, but I'm not sure any app is doing a good job with it",
            "Installed the app on my Samsung S10 as well as my Samsung Tabs S6 Lite. On the phone it works well. Layout is attractive, the information simple to read and certainly seems to be accurate. Everything works perfectly on the phone. But not on the tablet. The layout always rotates to landscape mode, regardless of the tablet settings. Customer support told me this cannot be changed in my settings but they intend to fix it with the next update. Until then I will uninstall it from my tablet. Too bad."

            "This is full of amazing ideas to help with persistent pain, broken into bite size pieces that you can try. Some seem more appropriate than others but this will obviously vary from person to person. A mix of physical and mental emotional suggestions, and they don't take a lot of time. Little and often is what's needed so even on a busy day you can do something to help.",
            "Excellent for chronic pain sufferers. It has helped me to rewire my brain to deal with a severe back injury which I'm now at the tail end of. However this app is more than dealing with pain. It's about neuroplasticity which is now helping me eliminate vertigo and tinnitus. Definitely worth the subscription as they are constantly updating content.",
            "I love this app. I learned so much about pain and I feel understood in my issues. Thank you soo much",
            "I have sciatica symptoms related to a bulging disc that have continued for a year. I have already found benefit in reduced pain symptoms after a few days. I am really shocked, in a good way. I am normally reluctant to pay for an app but compared to the thousands spent on gp, physio, chiro, pain medication, this is really not much. It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",
            "WOW the whole app changed since I been thinking of doing it. Is there no more old sessions? What happened to the old sessions? I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

            "Very poor communication so far. I asked them if they needed any more information from me in order to get my birth control, and they have yet to even respond to me. Giving it a 2 star rating for now, but it could easily drop seeing as I just started using the app. Honestly, it might just be best to schedule an appointment with your doctor. 🤷‍♀️ Edit: yes definitely a 1 star. Just go to a doctor please. It's just a huge scam",
            "I am overly grateful for this app. I've been using them for a little over a year and im happy I dont have to see a Dr in person for birth control. They are a rad bit slower to responding to messages since covid occurred but not by much. I've gotten all of my questions answered since I only started pills last year for the first time. Love it! ♡",
            "Convenient, affordable, accessible. Takes them days-weeks to respond to messages. Another week or so to to put the order through, no option for expedited shipping. But then your card gets declined (bank issues, low income, etc.) they lock the prescription until you change cards/message them to re-up the RX. Birth control is something you have to take regularly and it's ridiculous for them to make it so hard and time consuming EVERY time I try to order. Planned Parenthood is still best.",
            "I used to love this app for bc. I needed an emergency contraceptive and decided to get it through this app. It said $20. I checked out and my total was $35 because of the \"consultation fee\" which is dumb cause it's just plan b but hey I'll pay $35 instead of $50 if I got it directly from the store. I picked it up for it to be the regular $50 plus a stupid $15 consultation fee! Ridiculous! Very misleading.",
            "I used them for a couple of years. I have had to change my password three times over the course of three months. Could not get access to my own account due to an error saying that i did not have permission to access this account (after i already changed my password so i knew that was not the issue). I tried reaching out several times and was told to change my password and nobody has reached out to help me since. I have since changed who i get my birth control from."

            "after playing with the app a bit more I'm going to have to pause in my use. I love the simplistic way of checking off symptoms as I have them and the ability to find correlations. how ever this would be helpful for gathering the frequency of my symptoms. I'm currently using the flexable journal app if that app would correlate like yours with more flexability in what and how you can correlate and link it would be an amazing program"

PMR is a - scientifically proven - very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:\r\n\r\n• tensions\r\n• migraine or headache\r\n• inner unrest\r\n• sleep disorders\r\n• back pain / pain\r\n• states of excitement,\r\n• anxiety and panic attacks\r\n• high blood pressure\r\n• psychosomatic complaints\r\n• burnout \r\n• stress and much more\r\n\r\nWith regular practice, you will always find it easier to get into deeper states of relaxation. Once you have enough practice with the long form of PMR (Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups), you can switch to the short forms with 7 and 4 muscle groups and finally to the Mental form: Body Scan. Then you can relax your body even mentally.\r\n\r\nALL COMMON 4 FORMS OF PMR\r\n• Basic Form (17 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form I (7 muscle groups)\r\n• Short Form II (4 muscle groups)\r\n• Mental Form (Body Scan) \r\nfor Beginner, Advanced and Experienced are taught and practiced in this app.\r\n\r\nBASIC FORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1.

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

You need to take 75 milligrams twice each day.\r\n\r\nMagnesium: When taken daily, magnesium may help reduce the frequency of migraines. The mineral helps to quiet nerves, which tend to get overexcited throughout a migraine. Some studies have found that migraine sufferers are usually deficient in magnesium. You’ll likely need a lot more than the average multi-vitamin contains or about 400 to 600 milligrams each day. Look for amino acid-chelated magnesium (many brand names contain magnesium oxide, which is not absorbed as well).

And you can always research more after finding what plant works for what in this app! 💚💚💚 I also love the added feature of relaxation where it will play soft forest or river sounds for 10min! And I still have to keep exploring it, but it's really nice and user friendly!",
            "This is amazing! Very organized with lots of herbs and diseases with their remedies. I hope you can expand the app more (more herbs and diseases it can cure, maybe even how to plant these herbs, and how to use them) it's a lot to ask from me, I know 😂😂😂 But I'm sure doing so will result in this app becoming more popular as I'm already in love with this simply organized version 😍😍😍 Thanks a lot! Keep improving 🥺🥺🥺",

When you understand what makes your pain worse, you can begin to work on ways to reduce or deal with your pain “triggers.”\r\n\r\nThe more you know about how your body reacts, the more you can be in control. And being in better control can help you be less afraid and better able to manage your pain. \r\n\r\nThis app makes it easy to track your pain & symptoms and report to your doctors. Use our pain diary to keep track of your pain over time and share it with your doctor at your next appointment. Track a variety of pain elements, including location, pain duration, triggers and more.\r\n\r\nA pain diary is used to monitor levels of pain over a long period of time and collect data on possible triggers for that pain. One solution pain doctors recommend is keeping a pain diary, a consistent record of your pain experience.\r\n\r\nYour doctor will be looking for triggers, stresses, and patterns. The more detailed you can be about the factors that seem to influence your pain, the better. An accurate record of your pain will help your doctor give you the best treatment.\r\n\r\nWhy a Pain Journal Works for Chronic Pain\r\nThis information is useful both for you and your doctor. It can be used to help identify patterns of pain, such as time of day or level of stress, or pain triggers from certain activities. A pain journal can also show what doesn’t increase your pain, which can help you make better decisions about how you spend your day. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you log in a pain journal? Everybody uses their journal differently, but in this app you can do the following:\r\n- Give your pain a scale rating. We use the pain scale with the 0-10 rating system, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.\r\n- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.\r\n- Track the time of day pain occurs. \r\n- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. \r\n- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.\r\n- Write down what you ate and drank that day.\r\n- Describe your mood",

I'd like to pick that. Same with the possible triggers...  would love to find an app that combines this with a period app too. Mine tend to be connected.",
            "Good basic app. I need the ability to edit medication and to track possible triggers on pain free days. It would be good to track weather and geographical location automatically. The effect of stress and sleep is difficult to measure. I suggest to track the level of stress and hours of sleep. I would also like to be able to track attacks according to weekday. I would like to get the paid version but do not understand the advantages of doing so. Do you have clinical results of the tests &brainwave treatment.",
            "Gave up less than halfway into logging headache. Why ask for my demographic info? Too many spelling errors. Does not include my doctor prescribed migraine abortive, or allow me to enter new med. Does not allow me to enter multiple causes. Don't like the look of it - not professional.",
            "Not useful when i need to put my Rx  & the times i took it/effect, ect in notes instead of being able to add it to the given list and fill in the questions.",
            "This app is working well for me. There's a place for notes. It has everything the neurologist' headache form has."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "So far this is excellent. I was recently diagnosed with depression and need to keep track of my symptoms as well as effects of medications. Most of the other apps have a pre-set list of symptoms, and user is limited to those symptoms. This app allows you to create your own labels for symptoms, so you can be very specific with tracking your health issues. Also, the app creates a nice graph for visual representation of your symptoms. This app is exactly what i needed.",
            "I was searching for a log which seemed to be quite difficult until I found health log. You can add symptoms to the list, and pain levels. Just what I wanted.",
            "HELP option needed. It does everything I need so far. Had to read 100+ reviews to find developer comments to learn how to use, how to edit, etc. A \"how to/help\" in the dropdown menu is missing. Also, haven't yet figured out tracking >1 person. I got this to track my kid but would like to add myself. Overall it works well so far. Also, I haven't upgraded. Access to the full version (3day trial) would probably yield more upgrades. If full is just ad removal I'm ok with ads",
            "Good pain track and has a calendar view. Handy for a cancer patient like me. I haven't upgraded so far but i'll see in a few days when i need to backup.",
            "Really useful to track so I can keep my doctors up to date. However this morning when I went to sort categories it crashes everytime! EDIT: All fixed! Rating edited to 5 stars."

Thank you so much!!! :) I have not found a replacement for this so I'm super happy 😄 to have it back. Made my day.

        "description": "Simply track what you eat, your symptoms and moods and Endive will help you identify correlations in a visual graph form.\r\n\r\nFood is a common trigger of digestive symptoms.

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

        "description": "Migrapp relieves the pain of migraines with binaural waves (requires headphones for best effectiveness) and visual stimulation.\r\n\r\nA binaural wave in an audio made up of 2 tones at different Hz, if one tone has for example 400 Hz and the other tone 440 Hz then a subtraction between 440 Hz and 400 Hz would be 40 Hz.\r\n\r\nWell, those 40 hz are created within the brain in the form of a three-dimensional wave, facilitating the brain's frequency to adapt to the brain waves that would be 40 hz.\r\n\r\nIn this case the frequency is 0.5 hz which makes the headache and migraines disappear little by little\r\n\r\nSegún un estudio realizado en la Escuela de medicina de la Universidad Harvard, la luz verde con una longitud de onda de unos 530 nanómetros no perjudica tanto a las personas con migraña. Bajo condiciones de oscuridad puede incluso calmar los típicos dolores de cabeza de la migraña.\r\n\r\n«Más del 80 por ciento de los ataques migrañosos está relacionado y aumenta con la sensibilidad a la luz, por lo que muchos afectados de migraña buscan la oscuridad, con lo que se aíslan del trabajo, la familia y deactividades cotidianas», señala Rami Burstein, autor principal del estudio.\r\n\r\nDolor menos intenso con luz verde\r\n\r\nLos investigadores solicitaron a 41 pacientes con migraña que acudieran al laboratorio en el momento en el que sufrieran un ataque de migraña; una vez allí, les pidieron que contestaran una serie de test. Antes de llevar a cabo esa prueba debían esperar en una habitación con una iluminación tenue, que podía ser verde, ámbar, azul o roja, además de tener una longitud de onda concreta. Después de la sesión, los probandos debían indicar sí había cambiado su sensación de dolor y, en ese caso, de qué manera.\r\n\r\nEl equipo constató que la luz brillante acrecentaba el dolor de cabeza de los sujetos, independientemente del color. Sin embargo, ese efecto era más débil con la luz verde en comparación con el rojo, el ámbar y el azul. Además,cuando reducían la intensidad de la luz, el dolor mermaba de media un 20 por ciento con la habitación totalmente iluminada de verde, según se desprendía de las afirmaciones de los probandos.\r\n\r\nEl hecho de que las personas con migraña puedan soportar mejor la luz verde podría estar relacionado con que los conos de la retina y las neuronas que se activan reaccionan más débilmente a ese estímulo, señalan los autores. El equipo comprobó dicho fenómeno tanto en ratas como en humanos.\r\n\r\nLos investigadores esperan que el hallazgo contribuya al tratamiento del dolor de cabeza que sufren los pacientes con migraña; no obstante, advierten que faltan más estudios que confirmen los datos obtenidos. Por otro lado, el precio de las bombillas necesarias para aplicar este método en el ámbito doméstico resulta, de momento, demasiado elevado, explica Burstein. \r\n\r\nMore information at: https://www.investigacionyciencia.es/noticias/la-luz-verde-alivia-la-migraa-14262\r\n\r\nSources: Spektrum.de / Daniela Zeibig and Harvard University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\r\n\r\n- Drink water after listening to the audio.\r\n- Listen 2 times a day.\r\n- Use headphones preferably.\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS:\r\n\r\n- DO NOT listen to audio while driving.\r\n- The audios are NOT a substitute for medical treatments.\r\n-If you have a history of epilepsy, if you are pregnant or if you have a pacemaker, consult a doctor before using the app.\r\n\r\nThe developer, owner, author of the app \"Migrapp\" is not responsible for the effectiveness and effects that the app produces, for more information consult a doctor.",

Once I had and went to cancel this, I was still charged enough though I had not spoken to a lemonaid doctor to renew my prescription. I received a response of asking if my mental health was okay to my message requesting to cancel.",
            "This app is awesome i just renewed my prescription for another year. I love that i was able to pause and continue my prescription when needed with a simple phone call. Also that everything gets delivered to my door automatically so im never able to forget about it.",
            "I've been using this app to get my birth control for about 2 years now. I have them send the prescription to my local pharmacy. The doctors are always polite and professional. The app is easy to use and I've never had any issues with it. Love the fact that you can call or message them any time if you need an alternative prescription and they reply pretty quickly. The short phone consultations are great too!",
            "This app is amazing! I was able to get my birth control perscription sent to my local pharmacy very quickly. In the end, this visit was quicker, more affordable, and much more accessible than what was available locally! Update: I was even able to refil my perscription through their pharmacy for my next refil for quite a bit cheaper than my local pharmacy. I can not recommend them enough!",
            "well I would like to use the app but all I get is a spinning blue circle saying please wait at every single step I've had to restart my phone at least half a dozen times and it still doesn't work even though I have full Wi-Fi connectivity like seriously what in the actual f***? UPDATE: called and was told that bluetooth interferes with connectivity - ok - turned off bluetooth - that seemed to work - THEN the app stalled out with no way to proceed as I was trying to input my CC info - what garbage - just another rush to market useless app from the graveyard of failed ideas that is Silicon Valley - maybe all of the homeless urine in San Francisco is interfering with their product - who knows - but I give this app -800/10.

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

PMR is a very effective relaxation method. It is recommended by doctors and therapists for many symptoms that are mostly stress-related, such as:\r\n\r\n• tensions\r\n• migraine or headache\r\n• inner unrest\r\n• sleep disorders\r\n• back pain / pain\r\n• states of excitement\r\n• anxiety and panic attacks\r\n• high blood pressure\r\n• psychosomatic complaints\r\n• burnout \r\n• stress and much more\r\n\r\nWith regular practice, you will always find it easier to get into deeper states of relaxation. Once you have enough practice with the long version of PMR (Basic Form), you can switch to the Short Forms and finally to the Mental Form (Body Scan). Then you can even relax your body mentally.\r\n\r\nALL COMMON FORMS OF PMR\r\n• Basic Form: 17 Muscle Groups (Lite)\r\n• Short Form I: 7 Muscle Groups (Pro)\r\n• Short Form II: 4 Muscle Groups (Pro)\r\n• Mental Form: Body Scan (Pro)\r\nfor Beginner, Advanced and Experienced (Pro) are taught and practiced.\r\n\r\nFORM: 17 MUSCLE GROUPS\r\n1.

There should be a way to slow down the speed of the breathing in and out, it's going too fast from the very start. Very unpleasant for anyone who is trying to learn deep breathing for the first time. Might be suitable for someone who has done breathing exercises before.",

            "i like the audio cues for inhale & exhale. agree with other reviews that the breathing exercises could do with a bit more introduction, however, if you have ever done yoga breathing before this week be simple to use. the meditation is also good, a simple \" check in with your body\" approach, but british users will definitely Google at the butTOCK part 🤣",
            "I love simplicity of user interface. 8mins meditation is really very useful,this is what i was looking for. Manny other apps are too complicated to use, some have 1 hour meditation, because of that we lose interest. But here due to 8mins we do it regularly.",

Including what exaclty do I go into on settings.",

            "Very sketchy app and address is a restraunt as well as needing to give a permission to overlap apps and says that could change what your actually seeing also the responses to some ratings are weird and have typos which is not what I would expect from a 4 star app company with hundreds of thousands of downloads",

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "It was okay on my first visit, but ever since then it's been awful. I had my initial appt, he gave me a prescription and said to msg him in 2 wks. I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this program👍🏻KUDOS TO YOU❗",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

            "Good and addictive game mainly for rich players. If you have money you can grow very quickly othewise you are like a snail. I suggest IGG to introduce new equipment and weapons that gives you superpower and can only be achieve through knowledge, skill and decoding codes, so that only intellectuals can achieve this.Then this game will be balance for every players.",
            "Purchase packs are mostly affordable, but boatloads are needed for any real impact. There is a good social aspect to the game. The game is enjoyable and addictive for the conflict style of game. It's by far the best that I've played of it's style......It's a pity IGG is more interested in making money than the players. Expect to get a \"dah\" response to any real review of the game where they try to promote themselves in spite of your review.",
            "I've been playing the game for a few years, yes is can be grinding at time. And yes, the giant players are pay to play. Buut, it's been a great expereince. I've made a lot of friends, had a ton of fun and keep coming back for me. Also, full disclosure I've probably spent 50 bucks on in game purchases over the last 3 years so I didn't have drop a ton on money to have fun. Mainly spent it on Monster Hunting so in my opinion worth it to have more fun in game.",
            "The game is fun, no doubt about that. The in app purchases seem lackluster at best, as they seldom offer you what you need. Also, if you are willing to roll the dice with the \"chest of chance\" that they offer you, be prepared to spend some money because buying less than 100 of them will leave you as disappointed as a kid on Christmas with no gifts. However, as I mentioned before, the game is fun to play. Customer service ultimately killed this game for me though. Uninstalling now.",
            "What I like about this game are the cool heros. It can be addictive. This is the only game in which I have ever had my hands trembling in anger and anxiety. When my castle gets attacked; screen flashes red making me panic. Then the stupid popups when you open the game gets in the way of you quickly activating your sheild, b/c every second counts in this game. This game also attracts the worst kind of people and also a few nice(guild) people. This game is too demanding so I'll be uninstalling."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It used to be a good game until the last update. Instead of the usual 25 diamonds reward players usually got, now it's only 5 diamonds. The most ridiculous thing is that now you have to watch ads in order to apply lipsticks for every single client. What is this? I've watched ads and paid gems for many of the lipstick colours before but now?? Basically have to repeat all of that but now it seems endless. This game becomes kind of unbearable to play now. Please bring back the older features.",
            "Fantastic and creative game but why so many adds?! Adds are too much, every 30 sec. and they cause the game to lag. Please consider our time too. Recently, I finally paid up for no adds and now my game is locking up constantly. Newest updates cost too much money and you don't win diamonds like we used to in tasks. Not happy with the direction this game has gone. Used to be my favorite fashion game. So, so sad. 2020.",
            "Very wonderful and my favourite game of all.....💐💐🧡 I am playing super stylish from many months . Last year I downloaded this game I reached till level 21 or 18 but the game was hanged it wasn't loading . So I had to delete my favourite game. Then again I wanted to download it this year then I was feeling angry I had to start now from level 1 again!! Then now I have reached level 10 . Please ensure that this game should hang once again !! Please! See to it .. but it is my favourite game!",
            "I love this game so much fun especially since I love fashion games and dancing games the adds are a little crazy but not that bad. It is a lil annoying having that in app purchase add pops up everytime u level up but that's ok I still absolutely love this game no doubt about it. Another thing can u do is make it so ur character has a name please. But no other complaints. :D",
            "Omg where to begin. I've reached level 80 and no longer get any clients and it's hard for me to get any collection. When i tried to install and play other apps recommended from the app itself and decided to uninstall the new game, super stylist got uninstalled as well and i had to start all over again and lost collections i used to have."

            "A small in game fit in a Bunch of Ads.. TOO MANY ADS It is one of the most pathetic games i might have played. Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",
            "Well I was playing the game and there were so many ads and there 30 seconds ads😠. Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk.

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",

            "Sends chills immediately down my spine when she chases and it is amazing. Normally FNaF games give me a flatline heartrate after one jumpscare but this is not as scary as I imagined. Great graphics and hope to see updates in the future!",
            "It is superb game but , at cat 🐈 level it struck and it shows only loding .So ,then I uninstalled it but after some time I install it then I started playing again but at cat 🐈 level it struck again . It's previous levels are super I want to play more level . It has too many glitches .",
            "This is best offline and 3D game I have ever seen I like this game so much I am playing this game from 3 years and the grafics of this game are amazing this game is very funny and entertaning I couldn't bore while playing this game this game is better than scary stranger virtual mom and etc but I think you have to fix some things 1.this game's size is too big and update of game is above 300 mb in ordinary games the the update is not too big like this please make the update below 100 -150 mbs",
            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",

            "Fun game but glitchy. More often than not, when I attempt to access the \"Winner's Club\" screen, I'm greeted with the message, \"Sorry. There is a temporary issue with Winner's Club. Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different. Plunge into a whole series of adventures, going down into the city subway, traveling to the mountains and national parks on the edge of the city, and venturing through the wasteland, all while shooting your way through hordes of the walking dead.\r\n\r\nRPG AND SURVIVAL\r\nPrey Day is one of the most dangerous zombie survival games full of players who may have different goals and methods of survival - run, shoot, defend, team up, target, and fight real players fighting for survival just like you. Shooting games challenge your skill, speed, and reaction time, and when you're fighting for survival, you'll do everything you can not to die. With both co op and PVP elements, you can communicate and unite with friends, or oppose and kill competitors - the best traditions of MMO and online multiplayer games!",

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

Then I found that one of the symptoms appeared on today's date, when I haven't had it today. There was no way I could remove this symptom from today without deleting the actual symptom from the database! Such a lovely idea for an app if it worked properly. And there are no instructions.",
            "The app ws working great for a few months. I was tracking everything in readiness for an important doctors appointment next week. Woke up this morning to find all my tracking has gone! And there is no way that I can see to bring it back! Months of tracking gone. Now this is going to make a huge impact on my upcoming appointment.",
            "Can't export data because I can't add an email. Can't fix this because the email address provided on Google Play Store is no longer valid. Very, very disappointed and sad. This app is incredible but without being able to export data, it's 100% useless.",
            "very simple and easy to use for recording symptoms. the reporting leaves something to be desired. I'd like to be able to select one symptoms and then see how all the factors compare for that one symptom instead of selecting then one at a time.",
            "Excellent. Simple, customizable and for the data junky: exportable. I use it to track any environmental variable, moods, sleep, excercise, water etc and of course every outcome: vigor, acuity and the negative of course headaches, etc etc. Along with myfitnesspal it's the only health ap I need."

            "This is a cute game, but there are WAAAAAY too many ads! I don't need them forced on me in such an aggressive manner. Everything you do is another ad. Update: I bought the full version advertised, \"ad free\" of the game and you STILL are forced to watch ads. I immediately went for a refund and there wasn't an option. Do NOT let these people steal your money! THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM!",
            "Love the game. Although it has way to many ads, after every round there is a ad. I hate this so I'm giving it 4 stars. Please fix this, and I might come back and change my answer. Besides all the ads this Is a great game so I recommend anyone that likes tricky games and dosent mind lots of ads this game Is for you. But again please fix the ad problem it is getting on my nerves! But I will not delete this app. Thank you",
            "The ads are manageable if you keep your wifi off, and the graphics are cute. The biggest problem is that it just becomes tedious after a while. 2 choices for every level, sometimes logical and sometimes meant to be funny ... but it jusst gets boring really fast.",
            "I uninstalled immediately. After literally 3 seconds of playing a portion of the game, there are two ads: one of which you need to wait 5 seconds to skip, and the other is a full 30 seconds, all after 3 seconds of game play!! Absolutely obnoxious. And then it repeats.",
            "Clicked on only 2 things in the game and was hit with 5 full length adverts. This is just advert city. You have no time to enjoy the game, its just random tap and boom you're bombarded with adverts. I get that adverts fund development but there needs to be a trade off. In this case there is almost zero game and just one advertisement after the other. The hubris of calling this a game and then asking you to rate it after only 2 interactions with the game is staggering."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",

But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

In such a situation, people do not pay attention to their health and the resultant body becomes the home of small diseases. Even if these diseases seem normal, but take it seriously afterward. Headache is also one of these diseases. Many times the headache gets so high that people start taking up the headache medication. Later these drugs have a bad effect.

Headache is the human nervous system i.e. the nervous system and the neck related problems. Usually when you undergo any emotional or physical stress, then this problem appears as a physical reaction. In such a situation, not only the head, but the neck and the back also cause pain. Nowadays the headache is a very common problem, but if the meditation is not given during the time, then this problem can increase.\r\n1. Tension headache\r\n\r\nThis is the most common headache. In this type of headache, the person feels the acute pain on both sides of his head, like someone is pressing the rubber band from both sides. Due to such headaches, neck and shoulder muscles become very tight and feel swollen.\r\nReason: This kind of pain is caused by stress, lack of sleep or injury to the head.\r\nNote: Stress-related headaches can also be exposed to cold air. When the winter comes and the cold air moves or the air comes in contact with the air condition, when the air appears on your neck and head, this condition can also be a headache. Physiotherapy can be quite beneficial in tension headache .\r\n2. Migraine\r\nThe pain in migraine occurs on one side of the head, which is also called alfalfa. In this headache, the patient may have trouble with nausea, vomiting and light. In this, the patient feels pain like sticking something in the head.\r\n\r\nCauses: This headache can be due to the sharp aroma, changes in gold currency, changes in hormones, consumption of alcohol, stress or even loud noise.\r\nNote: Apart from this, this headache is also done with the consumption of certain foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, fruit of groundnut and citrus.\r\n3. Cluster headache\r\nThis type of headache is quite acute and painful. Cluster headaches can occur several times in a day, but do not occur for a long time. Sometimes it starts at any one time, like - if it starts in the morning, then for some time it will be in the morning only. This pain can occur at one side of the head and one eye, because it also affects the nerve of the face.\r\nReason: It can be due to heat, exhaustion, smoking, alcohol intake and more or faster light.",

I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

The screen moves, I can craft and destroy blocks but I can't move. I made a new world and it works just fine, I'm kind of sad that I'm losing everything from the first one, since I made a lot of progress and I had a lot of things. I will try to play again in the new world but if the problem happens again I will rate it lower",
            "I FOUND THE GAME FINALLY. This game was my whole childhood. When I couldn't afford Minecraft, I would play this, and I remember spending hours building things. If for some reason you can't spare 10 bucks to get Minecraft, this is definitely one of the better rip-offs out there. If I could recommend one thing however, maybe implement a feature that would allow you to transfer worlds? I would be very curious as to what the world I spent hours making looks like.",
            "Very good game, good graphics. D game is cool cuz u can go to other dimension its so cool like this is d best game ever. But am rating it a 4 star bcuz in other mine crafts u can fly but this one u can't fix that and also make a setting to on/off d zombies and creepy things so u won't be scared when playing. If ur reading this download d game cuz its cool download u won't regret it.",
            "Excellent Game . But there are some problems- 1. The blocks are disappearing whenever i am visiting the snow fields 2. Today i have brought a empty milk bottle from the shop at day and went to get some milk from cow , but after going a distance from my house the game had automatically cutted ❌🚪 when i again start the game it is night ,I was in my house and there is no bottle with me ! Please let me know why it is happening🙏🙏",
            "Old Minecraft gamer- Needs auto filling in the chests so you don't get left with 5 things that can go in one stack, the bow is pretty useless even if you get amethyst bow... It doesn't shoot far enough and takes too long/awkward to draw. Other than that it's pretty awesome, although a world map would be very very useful along with having the compass."

It is to small to put the photo of my face inside. I would like it if you make it bigger. And when I cut the persons hair, it is messy. Please make this game better.",

This is a challenge for the 3 year old as the ads messes up her game play. I'm one of those people who will purchase a game to remove ads and sadly, that doesn't appear to be an option.",

            "This is the perfect little sound machine in a mobile app to help me sleep living on a busy street with a lot of inner apartment noise and thin walls. There's a great variety of nature sounds and sample background noise with complete mixer options to layer the sounds and play with or without a timer. Truly a sleep saver and well designed app.",
            "I love this app but hubby loves it more lol. I can finally turn the AC off when it's too cold and he doesn't complain about needing the noise. Once in a while the app turns off at night but I just turn it on when I notice. It's probably just my phone settings that I haven't figured out how to fix.",
            "Wonderful app marred by ads that can't be removed. But all the sounds are spot on and there's a sleep timer. but dev, please release a Pro version or add IAP to free version so we can get rid of the ads that crowd the controls and ruin the look.",
            "I love this app! It's easy to use, has lots of different sounds and you can layer them into hundreds of different combinations.",

            "I like this app alot that I could not resist. If anyone that doesn't know how to play this game you just need to slide your finger and whatever character will fall down and escape. But be careful if you are in a biger level there will be harmful enemies. Still I rated this app 5 stars.",
            "The game is not so good, it has low quality graphics. Also the level hardness are not changing, some levels are repeating. It is also promotes animal killing (which is worse ). The funniest part is when the blood from animal or the human pours out like water from a tap 😂",
            "Very great game Remove like atleast 10 adds cuz those are pretty annoying sometime five out of five Even if insane mode is like very hard Still like it And happy Halloween 🎃 5 star gameplay,graphics,controls Me and my brother play this when were bored and also download among us by Innersloth thats also a great game It's lots of fun also plz Make easy mode cost 50 coins I literally have 2010 coins I wanna waste some on easy mode Just download the game And support it For good reasons Very good",
            "Much interesting game. Only one thing to improve that there are much ads. Remove much ads as you can in advance★★★★★. I know you will improve it and remove ads. But i love this game truly. Please remove ads then thing to improve"
