Once I was clear on how to use app, I really appreciate having somewhere to log my daily concerns. I do wish there were more specific body parts, but I LOVE that u can put notes in and be more specific there.",
            "Really great free app with incredibly reasonably priced premium levels (although I've not needed to upgrade from free yet so can't comment on their pros & cons). You can add your own pain descriptors and chart things like mental fog and fatigue. It doesn't take too long to fill out and you can easily change the entry date. The only thing I \"don't like\" is that it defaults to filling out the daily reflection rather than pain when opening the app. Definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!",
            "Really useful for tracking pain, and I like all the options they give you for stuff. Plus you can make your own! I just started tracking my pain and this app has helped give a visual of how much I neglect to address my physical health. Glad I stumbled upon this :)",

            "Outstanding App to help you track pain types, areas and symptoms. Able to show different pain types in different areas of the body. I love that you can add notes as well in journal entries! The reports are fantastic and easy to email with you deciding the custom time span. The insights that can show correlation between activity, weather, and other triggers really helps. Love that I can attach to Samsung Health and thus my sleep, EKGs and pulse rate, BP, etc to see correlations! Great App!!!",
            "I've been using this app for months now and I still love it. It's easy to use, it syncs with my Samsung Health, and the helpful articles and tips are normally quick reads and informative, and it has easy adjustments in the settings. I highly recommend this app.",
            "So far it's a good useful app. One suggestion. Love to have ability to add multiple entries during the day without altering my earlier input.This will help me better track triggers and effectiveness of the different things I do to help alleviate my pain. Also, there needs to be room for more than one entry for doc location,insurance& pain on opposite side of the body.If I have pain in back of legs and knees, the figure turns around but deleted the previous tagged body pain location.",
            "I've only been using this app for a short time but so far it is the best that I have tried. I have chronic pain with various etiologies and the app has a detailed pain map that allows me to more precisely record my pain. The automatic time stamp is a great feature as is the ability to link it to my Fitbit for superior insights that corralate sleep and activity to pain levels. Im holding off on that 5th star because I am still learning the app and all of its functionality.",
            "The PainScale app has been great! I am able to track my whole day. Pain, food and anything else I need. I have added my glucose readings in the notes. I am also able to put on there my activities making me able to see any issues and also my progress. Thank you!"

You can use it via the &quot;⋮&quot; button at the top right of the Brush window.<br>- Added new filters: &quot;Waterdrop (Rounded)&quot;, &quot;Emboss&quot;, &quot;Chrome&quot;, &quot;QR Code&quot; and &quot;Find Edges&quot;.<br>&quot;QR Code&quot; is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.",

            "Overall, I like this app. I just have a couple suggestions to make. -Add a trash feature, so that you still have some time to get a deleted picture back in case you accidentally delete something or change your mind. -Add a slider to the video playback. With really long videos, it's annoying to have to watch the entire thing through to get to certain parts, even with the fast-forward.",
            "This app is great! There's not that many ads, there's the right amount of tools to make wonderful drawings! It can be a little confusing at first but you'll soon get used to it! The only problem I have is, you have to have a membership to rearrange art order in your gallery?? I know they need to make some money somehow but... That just seems ridiculous and unnecessary, but other then that it's great!",
            "I need help, like when I was coloring the drawing that I just finished, suddenly it disappears, i was very scared of what just happened, i think I can redo it but I clicked on the redo button for like 1000 times it still doesn't give me back my drawing. I'm very anxious after what just happened. So can someone please help me out with this, please...😰😰😰😰",
            "This is byfar one of the best and very intuitive drawing app, I can work faster using Ibis compared to when I'm working with another drawing app. Stabilizer works great, doesn't stabilize too much, although I'd rather have the heavy stabilizer as optional because sometimes I need it too. Or at least there's more curved or flex ruler.",
            "I love this app and I would recommend but you have to be aware of lower battery and deleting this app. But there are so many cool things you can do. I use this all the time. It's easy, fun and free only, you have to watch an add before using all brushes. This is good quality and needs no WiFi."

            "Best app for pain management that I have tried I noticed a difference when I didn't use it for a week",
            "Works but free version sucks. All options are blocked. You can not do anything but play and stop. You have buy each app for access to get access just to rewind. Seems greedy when they claim to want to help. Not even free trial to see if blocked options are worth purchase.",
            "I have severe difficulty in falling asleep some nights, so bad that occasionally I'm up for 36 hours because I could not fall asleep at all. Also I've never been able to be hypnotized but last night I tried this app for the first time and within minutes of completing the First session I was asleep. Some nights it's pain that keeps me awake, and some nights it's my brain that won't wind down and allow me to rest and last night both were preventing me from getting to sleep until I tried this app.",
            "I've only spent $ to change the settings, so I'm only using the free track. I haven't noticed relief in my a.m. (fibromyalgia/arthritis) stiffness/achiness, but I sleep better. I also have ADHD, so focused relaxation and then hypnosis drop usually has me asleep quickly. I love how she phrases things (\"that all is just right\") and the slightly amused tone when she talks about toes. I've only gotten to the end 2x, and I've used the imagery during a nerve pain flare to calm it. Love this app!"

            "This is full of amazing ideas to help with persistent pain, broken into bite size pieces that you can try. Some seem more appropriate than others but this will obviously vary from person to person. A mix of physical and mental emotional suggestions, and they don't take a lot of time. Little and often is what's needed so even on a busy day you can do something to help.",
            "Excellent for chronic pain sufferers. It has helped me to rewire my brain to deal with a severe back injury which I'm now at the tail end of. However this app is more than dealing with pain. It's about neuroplasticity which is now helping me eliminate vertigo and tinnitus. Definitely worth the subscription as they are constantly updating content.",
            "I love this app. I learned so much about pain and I feel understood in my issues. Thank you soo much",
            "I have sciatica symptoms related to a bulging disc that have continued for a year. I have already found benefit in reduced pain symptoms after a few days. I am really shocked, in a good way. I am normally reluctant to pay for an app but compared to the thousands spent on gp, physio, chiro, pain medication, this is really not much. It has given me back some hope that my quality of life will improve which is priceless. I'll update the review after a few weeks, maybe even pain free!",
            "WOW the whole app changed since I been thinking of doing it. Is there no more old sessions? What happened to the old sessions? I know I tested the old 10 free sessions & loved them, but was not ready to use the app & now everything change. As well as why can't your app be moved to the sd card? It takes too much space on the internal space when you are low on space. The app keeps crashing because my phone is low on space as there is no way to move it to the SD card."

Some advices i wanna give you: Dont let the player heal his diseases by watching videos, it makes everything too easy and less challenging, This makes the meds also useless. Slightly improve the resistence of weapons. Add the trade value of each item. For the players: All the ads that show up can be skipped after 5 secs, and they're not so repetitive as some comments say.",
            "Tried to play on Pixel 4 XL and the game just keeps crashing while trying to open it up. Finished chapter 1 and after I closed the game I tried to open it up again and it keeps crashing. Sometimes right before login screen sometimes right after clicking \"Continue\" and it's just so random. I even reinstalled and played the first chapter all over again but still the same issue after closing the game once. I hope the bugs will get fixed at some point so that the game is actually playable.",
            "The best! This is by far the best zombie game I've played. It's not out to break your wallet and cheat you out your items. We get to fight and kill like all the other games, we get to build our shelter, and collect items to survive. We get free packages with lots of good items, we sleep, food spoils like it's real. Only thing I would suggest is to make it larger other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Keep the cost and packages the same cause that is what puts you over the top.",
            "BEST Modern survival game I have ever played. You can play it at a stretch for 4-7 hours if you can, it's designed that way. Challenging but no unplayable roadblocks, Doesn't get boring and LOTS OF CONTENT. after Westland Survival, this one is my most played. Happy to watch ads to get much needed supplies. Love the realism and detail , greater than most other survival games",
            "good game. but theres some issue i need to be in balance. save proggress must be in all times. you only save the game when you return in the base. thats really sucks me out. and the potato. when its fresh. it only stacks 1. but if its rotten. its stackble. what is that? and the weapons. easy to break. even a crowbar with high consume reasource. easy to break out. the car even its not on use. continues to break. and all max stacks is only 20. please fix the game a bit. please"

        "description": "This log can help you track the everyday things that have an impact on your pain. When you understand what makes your pain worse, you can begin to work on ways to reduce or deal with your pain “triggers.”\r\n\r\nThe more you know about how your body reacts, the more you can be in control. And being in better control can help you be less afraid and better able to manage your pain. \r\n\r\nThis app makes it easy to track your pain & symptoms and report to your doctors. Use our pain diary to keep track of your pain over time and share it with your doctor at your next appointment. Track a variety of pain elements, including location, pain duration, triggers and more.\r\n\r\nA pain diary is used to monitor levels of pain over a long period of time and collect data on possible triggers for that pain. One solution pain doctors recommend is keeping a pain diary, a consistent record of your pain experience.\r\n\r\nYour doctor will be looking for triggers, stresses, and patterns. The more detailed you can be about the factors that seem to influence your pain, the better. An accurate record of your pain will help your doctor give you the best treatment.\r\n\r\nWhy a Pain Journal Works for Chronic Pain\r\nThis information is useful both for you and your doctor. It can be used to help identify patterns of pain, such as time of day or level of stress, or pain triggers from certain activities. A pain journal can also show what doesn’t increase your pain, which can help you make better decisions about how you spend your day. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you log in a pain journal? Everybody uses their journal differently, but in this app you can do the following:\r\n- Give your pain a scale rating. We use the pain scale with the 0-10 rating system, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Your pain will usually fall somewhere in between.\r\n- Use pain descriptor words. Using pain descriptor words in your journal can help you track changes and patterns in your pain quality. It can also help doctors pinpoint your type of pain.\r\n- Track the time of day pain occurs. \r\n- Note what you are doing when your pain begins. \r\n- Look at elements that might contribute to your pain.\r\n- Write down what you ate and drank that day.\r\n- Describe your mood",

This one is great for keeping to show my pain management doctor because it's not so much information.",

            "Content is great... When I can access it. If I pause a recording it is very hard to get out to open again. I have to try repeatedly and don't know if it will work. I've given up and read the transcripts for some things but that doesn't work well for a meditation. Please fix these bugs!",
            "I think this is a brilliant app and my pain is so much more manageable after only a month. My reason for only giving 4 stars is that an awful lot of the work is going back to childhood. I have done years of therapy and I just don't need this so a lot of exercises etc are useless to me. Some brain training exercises and the somatic taking is really helpful... Building new neural pathways.",
            "As a musician, RSI has had a significant effect on me for years and finally now I'm able to play again. The app works on the premise that after the source of pain has healed, the sensation can remain because the brain gets stuck in a pain loop, exacerbated by anxiety and anticipation of the pain. The app is based on valid (and relatively recent) research and I'm delighted to say it has worked for me. Thank you Curable.",
            "Great concept but app needs some fixing I love curable and what they do. The content is great but sometimes my meditations stop playing somewhere half way and it ruins the whole meditation experience. Another thing is sometimes the shortcut for the meditation will stay on my drop-down in which nothing will make it disappear unless I restart my phone. Just a bug I'm assuming hopefully the developers fix this",
            "This app may help you. You will need to be able to tune your body to certain unknown frequencies and believe that the MRI study they refer to was not a flawed study from the start. If you are easily brainwashed this is the app for you. Worth a try if you are in constant pain. Good luck."

            "Like very much that this app is not intrusive! But wish that I had the \nability to log multiple entries/times for the same day sInce chronic pain \nis consistent throughout the day but at different levels at different \ntimes.. I do not understand the medication portion (it is not intuitive) \nbut maybe that's because it's laid out for a full day's input versus split \nout into multiple time frames. Probably will not use this app since it does \nnot fit my needs. **** Update: figured out that I can add another entry for \nmedication for each time I have to take another dose.....just wish I could \nalso log the different intensity of the pain level at that particular time. \n***** Increased star rating to 4 ***** but still need to give more \ncharacter space on both lines under medication lines so we can add hourly \nnotes of pain levels as well as adding more character space in the notes \nsection ....with doing this we (I) can manage to get this app to basically \nwork enough to be useful",

But now you get bombarded with them when you add or edit information in the app. I purchased the Pro version and the only thing different is the ADs are gone. Nothing else has been fixed or added to the Pro version. :(",
            "i have been keeping Pain Logs for a long time, and on coming into the 21st Century, I've looked and looked for a good app, so that I don't need to write, and this app is great, easy to use, and full of more potential. All of the additions that Jess Pine, Reviewer Comments below, recommended are excellent ideas, especially adding in body areas, such as, elbows and ankles, as well as, more items on the pain descriptor list. I would also like to have more room in the Notes at the end."

A few problems that I encountered are that there were limited colors, there is no color wheel and you are given defult colors to work with. There is also no zoom in and out control so your stuck with just the size of your screen. This app is usable seeing as why I gave it 2 instead of one stars. You cannot undo what you undid and that was odd because there is and undo button just no redo button. There is also no layers."

            "Having back pain on a daily basis, I have tried these excercises out of desperation . They do work great to alleviate back pain . Even better than pain relievers and i cant tell you how happy I am about this app. Theres only a few excercises, so you can learn them quickly. Now that I do them regularly, it helps stop my back pain BEFORE it starts. I strongly recommend this app to anyone suffering from mild to severe, occasional or chronic back pain. Try it...I guarantee you'll be glad you did.",
            "Great concept! I would suggest verbal instructions, as it is nearly impossible to view the excercises being displayed while doing them. Also, a time gap between the exercises and rest periods of about 10seconds would be more convenient, as this gives one opportunity to switch positions, without having to pause. I would also suggest displaying the exercises (and their demos) before the session starts, as to allow the user opportunity to familiarise themselves with the excercises and do them well!",
            "Good app ,& easy could be better. I like the 6mins just enough to get the chair kinks out. Cannot set to repeat every couple of hours. This needs cues like chimes or dings to tell how long to hold each pose in order to follow avatar without having to constantly keep eyes on the phone, annoying! Transition from resting to next exercise is too fast, is frustrating, and must rush to catch up. That's the reason for stars. Would pay for a pro version if this app was a bit more intuitive.",
            "Very good. Also why did you cut short your per session exercises to 3?. I love the old way of doing all the exercises at once. Please see if you can include all of them.",
            "So cool, there're lots of exercises useful, also has access youtube link to do correct the exercises from trainers. Thanks for all for this app creators 👍👍👍"

            "This is a great app! I was surprised how simple, yet difficult it can be. Kind of startling... and amazing how easy simple distrations can interrupt your thought process. I will continue to work with this.",
            "I can't properly rate the app as I only used it once, but I couldn't find any other place for \"customer service.\" As I previously stated I'm a first time user, & was reading everything I can before the app. It was reccommended by PT for my CRPS in my knee, which this app doesn't address but the concept is still helpful. On your about page you have words like yarning instead of yawning, that needs to be change. There are a few more edits needed, but that jumped off the page.",
            "Fantastic tool. Worth it for medical professionals and their patients/clients right across the entire pain spectrum to start the \"self\" rediscovery journey to self management with little to no medical intervention. What a gift for all of us who suffer 24/7 with these horrible & debilitating \"invisible\" (& therefore usually dismissed, belittled & not often believed) chronic/complex nerve pain syndromes. Maybe this could even help save some lives. Going to share the hell out of this app to get the word put. Well done Development Team! .. Thankyou",
            "not as easy as you would think it would be! Really makes you think! I can see why this may help with my condition of CRPS! My Dr. wants me to use the program three times a day for three times a day for the first month, and then once a day there after. Thanks for giving the first levels for free! I have been using for a full month now snd plan to keep using the program!",

Other than that its a lovely little app that's simple to use and has good info.",
            "Kinda hard to read and watch the video while doing the poses, and there is no voice over to guide you through it. About as useful as just looking at some pictures of yoga poses, really missed the point of making an app in the first place",
            "Pics are too small to see poses. Clicking on them didn't make them.larger,.so I couldn't decide if I wanted to incorporate them in or not. Deleted ap without even using. Not helpful.",

It includes pain felt behind and around the knee cap, especially during activities like stair climbing, squatting, running, and walking while carrying a heavy load. Knee pain can prevent you from participating in your favorite activities and performing daily tasks. Without proper treatment, it can be problematic for years.\r\n\r\nKnee pain can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which include knee stiffness, incorrect positioning of the knee cap at rest or with movement, flat feet, improper exercise form, and weakness of the muscles that control the hip and knee.\r\n\r\nKnee strengthening exercises do not affect the knee joint directly, but they strengthen the muscles surrounding it. Strong muscles in the legs can help provide support for the knees. This support may alleviate pressure and strain on these joints, which can relieve pain and help a person be more active.\r\n\r\nGentle stretching and strengthening exercises can strengthen the muscles that support your knee joint. Having stronger muscles can reduce the impact and stress on your knee, and help your knee joint move more easily.\r\n\r\nWhy exercise is vital?\r\n\r\nExercise can help you improve your health and fitness without hurting your joints.

Whatever the cause, once you have low back pain, it can be hard to shake. About one in four Americans say they've had a recent bout of low back pain. And almost everyone can expect to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it’s clearly serious: You were injured, or you feel numbness, weakness, or tingling in the legs. Call the doctor, of course. But for routine and mild low back pain, here are a few simple tips to try at home.\r\n\r\nChill it. Ice is best in the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury because it reduces inflammation.\r\n\r\nKeep moving. Our spines are like the rest of our body -- they're meant to move. Keep doing your daily activities. Make the beds, go to work, walk the dog. Once you're feeling better, regular aerobic exercises like swimming, bicycling, and walking can keep you -- and your back -- more mobile. Just don't overdo it. There's no need to run a marathon when your back is sore.\r\n\r\nStay strong. Once your low back pain has receded, you can help avert future episodes of back pain by working the muscles that support your lower back, including the back extensor muscles. Having strong hip, pelvic, and abdominal muscles also gives you more back support. Avoid abdominal crunches, because they can actually put more strain on your back.\r\n\r\nWays to Manage Low Back Pain at Home\r\n\r\nSleep Better: When you have back pain, sleeping can be hard. It can be a vicious cycle because when you don't get enough sleep, your back pain may feel worse. A poor sleep position can also aggravate back pain. \r\n\r\nGood Posture: Grandma was right! Slouching is bad for you. And poor posture can make back pain worse, especially if you sit for long periods. \r\n\r\nPhysical Therapy\r\nPhysical therapists can teach you how to sit, stand, and move in a way that keeps your spine in proper alignment and alleviates strain on your back.\r\n\r\n✅ back pain relief\r\n✅ lower back pain relief\r\n✅ sciatica relief\r\n✅ sciatic nerve relief",

        "description": " Reasons for knee pain \r\n\r\nIf you’re not dealing with a specific injury—say, a torn ACL—sorting out knee pain can seem complicated. The knee is composed of two joints: the tibiofemoral joint, between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), and the patellofemoral joint, between the femur and patella (knee cap). Each is an anchor point for multiple tendons, fascia, and other structures, including the IT band. If you have bad biomechanics, typically caused by a muscle imbalance, especially weak glutes, repetitive movement can irritate structures in the knee and lead to what is broadly known as anterior knee pain—a catchall category for general pain in the front of the knee.  \r\nThe stabilizer muscles for the knee, counterintuitively, are in the hips. When those muscles are weak or imbalanced, they can’t keep your knee properly aligned. “If you’re not able to control the position of your leg as your foot makes contact with the ground, pedal, or rock, it can result in increased stress to the structures of the knee. To further complicate the issue, once the pain signals your brain that there’s a problem, this can lead to further compensations in response to the irritation, which can shut off key muscles and tighten up other structures.\r\n\r\n Explanation of all the muscles that need to be strengthened and why: \r\n\r\n\r\nQuadriceps.\r\n\r\nThey cover the front of the thigh, cross the kneecap and form a tendon known as the patellar tendon. The quadriceps muscles allow you to extend or straiten the knee. If there is a weakness or tightness in the quadriceps you will get pain and stress in the joint as you go upstairs or get up from a chair.\r\n\r\nHip adductor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Adductors allow you to adduct your leg or bring it to the midline of the body. They help to stabilise the hip joint and help maintain the body in a stationary position.\r\n\r\nHip flexor muscles.\r\n\r\nHip Flexor muscles allow you to flex your hip. Hip Flexor muscles come from the spine and the pelvis and attach to the upper thigh bone. If the hip flexors are tight or weak they can pull the thigh out of its proper alignment. This in turn pulls the kneecap out of its groove causing knee pain.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles.\r\n\r\nHamstring muscles allow you to bend the knee and also extend your hip. Most importantly strong hamstring muscles will help you protect a very important ligament called the ACL.\r\n\r\nGastrocnemius muscle.\r\n\r\nPeople with weak calf muscles often complain of pain in the front of the knee around the patellar tendon area.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius.\r\n\r\nGluteus medius allows you to perform activities including hip abduction and hip external rotation. When you’re walking you’re only on one foot at any given time. The Gluteus medius help you to stabilise your pelvis. If it’s weak you get a drop in your hip and that causes stress on the knee.\r\n\r\nGluteus maximus.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to extend your hip and externally rotate your hip. If the Gluteus maximus muscles are weak other muscles in the back of the leg tend to take over and you end up with overly active hamstrings and tight hamstrings lead to knee pain.",

            "I can see this game is making much progress since i had it last installed; the English dialogue is vastly improved, more content, good changes in storyline and so on! But still there are some things that really annoy me, here it comes: 1. No way to drop items 2. Can not sort items 3. Greenhouse items should have it's own category 4. It would be really helpful if you can throw rocks/dirt to distract zombies to get past some 5. A fridge to preserve food (enhance durability) 6. Skill system Thanks",
            "Game is great, but food is scarce. Also the supplies does not make sense for the free version and the premium.",
            "Bit peeved with this. I brought it cause I love the game yet with the paid version you have to complete chapter1 before you can play challenge mode when it's available straight away in the free version. If I've paid for the game I should be able to lay what mode I want whenever I want",
            "It's more of a puzzle game rather than a true survival game. A zombie survival game you have the ability to collect, build and free range. This game doesn't have that ability as resources such as liquids to keep alive are way too limited. Was fun for about a day.",
            "When food more dangerous than zombie 😂, and it would be 5 stars if not bcs the absurd food logic 😂. Like cooked food still give you decease (rotten meat -> stomachache, baked potato -> stomachache) 😥 , food rotten very fast ( and its start to rotten when u discovered it ) , no option to preserve ur food ( fridge/dry )"

Ancient Yoga\r\nA bit gentle stretching can make a significant impact. Yoga is a mind-body-soul treatment that’s frequently suggested to heal not only back pain but the stress that come with it. Yoga’s focus on balance and steadiness encourages your body to develop defences against the causes of back pain, which include weak abdominal and pelvic muscles, as well lack of flexibility in the hips. \r\nAccording to research yoga may even help reduce the need for pain medication.\r\n\r\n2. Vedic Exercise / workout\r\nVedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge.

Pranayama \r\nThe breath is an essential part of yoga practice and pranayama is the formal practice of regulating the breath. PRANA means life force, energy or Qi, & AYAMA is the sanskrit word for ‘extension’. In Chinese Medicine the concept of prana (or Qi) is defined as energy on the verge of materializing. \r\nBy breathing more deeply within the pranayama practice, we are boosting more oxygen to the tissues and breaking this cycle. We can also use our breath as a way to calm our nervous system. Extending the exhalation so that it is longer than the inhalation reduces the resting level of the sympathetic nervous system so that the parasympathetic nervous system can conserve energy and we can feel more relaxed. \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n- 3D model animation yoga & exercise training\r\n- Easy to understand home-based yoga, workouts & exercise\r\n- Personal trainer to keep track of daily back pain relief plan\r\n- Addition in-detail videos to understand Yoga poses, Pranayama & Exercises better way\r\n- Pain relief blogs for additional daily tips on Back pain therapy\r\n- More customise plans for each user\r\n- Nonveg / Veg / Vegan diet for all kind of users.\r\n- Daily workout and diet tracker\r\n- Daily reminder to keep you on track\r\n\r\nEasy, helpful and FREE!

        "description": "1. Reclining pigeon pose\r\nPigeon pose is a common yoga pose. It works to open the hips. There are multiple versions of this stretch. The first is a starting version known as the reclining pigeon pose. If you’re just starting your treatment, you should try the reclining pose first.\r\n\r\nWhile on your back, bring your right leg up to a right angle. Clasp both hands behind the thigh, locking your fingers.\r\nLift your left leg and place your right ankle on top of the left knee.\r\nHold the position for a moment. This helps stretch the tiny piriformis muscle, which sometimes becomes inflamed and presses against the sciatic nerve, causing pain.\r\nDo the same exercise with the other leg.\r\nOnce you can do the reclining version without pain, work with your physical therapist on the sitting and forward versions of pigeon pose.\r\n. Sitting pigeon pose\r\nSit on the floor with your legs stretched out straight in front of you.\r\nBend your right leg, putting your right ankle on top of the left knee.\r\nLean forward and allow your upper body to reach toward your thigh.\r\nHold for 15 to 30 seconds. This stretches the glutes and lower back.\r\nRepeat on the other side.\r\n3. Forward pigeon pose\r\nKneel on the floor on all fours.\r\nPick up your right leg and move it forward on the ground in front of your body. Your lower leg should be on the ground, horizontal to the body. Your right foot should be in front of your left knee while your right knee stays to the right.\r\nStretch the left leg out all the way behind you on the floor, with the top of the foot on the ground and toes pointing back.\r\nShift your body weight gradually from your arms to your legs so that your legs are supporting your weight. Sit up straight with your hands on either side of your legs.\r\nTake a deep breath. While exhaling, lean your upper body forward over your front leg. Support your weight with your arms as much as possible.\r\nRepeat on the other side.\r\n4. Knee to opposite shoulder\r\nThis simple stretch helps relieve sciatica pain by loosening your gluteal and piriformis muscles, which can become inflamed and press against the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\nLie on your back with your legs extended and your feet flexed upward.\r\nBend your right leg and clasp your hands around the knee.\r\nGently pull your right leg across your body toward your left shoulder. Hold it there for 30 seconds. Remember to pull your knee only as far as it will comfortably go. You should feel a relieving stretch in your muscle, not pain.\r\nPush your knee so your leg returns to its starting position.\r\nRepeat for a total of 3 reps, then switch legs.\r\n5. Sitting spinal stretch\r\nSciatica pain is triggered when vertebrae in the spine compress. This stretch helps create space in the spine to relieve pressure on the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\nSit on the ground with your legs extended straight out with your feet flexed upward.\r\nBend your right knee and place your foot flat on the floor on the outside of your opposite knee.\r\nPlace your left elbow on the outside of your right knee to help you gently turn your body toward the right.\r\nHold for 30 seconds and repeat three times, then switch sides.\r\n6. Standing hamstring stretch\r\nThis stretch can help ease pain and tightness in the hamstring caused by sciatica.\r\n\r\nPlace your right foot on an elevated surface at or below your hip level. This could be a chair, ottoman, or step on a staircase. Flex your foot so your toes and leg are straight. If your knee tends to hyperextend, keep a slight bend in it.\r\nBend your body forward slightly toward your foot. The further you go, the deeper the stretch. Don’t push so far that you feel pain.\r\nRelease the hip of your raised leg downward as opposed to lifting it up. If you need help easing your hip down, loop a yoga strap or long exercise band over your right thigh and under your left foot.\r\nHold for at least 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.",

        "description": "Stomach ache and abdominal pain\r\nA stomach ache is a term often used to refer to cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It's usually short-lived and is often not serious.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis – the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer – a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones – small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis – inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS – a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning – in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain – painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems – such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. \r\n2. Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

        "description": "Doing exercises to strengthen the lower back can help alleviate and prevent lower back pain. It can also strengthen the core, leg, and arm muscles.According to researchers, exercise also increases blood flow to the lower back area, which may reduce stiffness and speed up the healing process.\r\nBelow, we explain how to do a few exercises that strengthen the lower back and may help people manage lower back pain:\r\n1. Bridges\r\nBridges work a person’s gluteus maximus, which is the large muscle of the buttocks. People engage this muscle when they move their hips, particularly when they bend into a squat.\r\n\r\nThe gluteus maximus is one of the most important muscles in the body, and keeping it strong can help support the lower back.\r\n\r\nTo perform a bridge:\r\n\r\nLie on the ground and bend the knees, placing the feet flat on the floor hip-width apart.\r\nPress the feet into the floor, keeping the arms by the sides.\r\nRaise the buttocks off the ground until the body forms a straight line from the shoulders to the knees.\r\nSqueeze the buttocks with the shoulders remaining on the floor.\r\nLower the buttocks to the ground and rest for a few seconds.\r\nRepeat 15 times and then rest for 1 minute.\r\nDo 3 sets of 15 repetitions.\r\n2. Knee-to-chest stretches\r\nDoing a knee-to-chest stretch can help elongate the lower back, relieving tension and pain.\r\n\r\nTo perform the knee-to-chest stretch:\r\n\r\nLie on the back on the floor.\r\nBend the knees, keeping both feet flat on the floor.\r\nUse both hands to pull one knee in toward the chest.\r\nHold the knee against the chest for 5 seconds, keeping the abdominals tight and pressing the spine into the floor.\r\nReturn to the starting position.\r\nRepeat with the opposite leg.\r\nRepeat with each leg 2–3 times twice a day.\r\n3. Lower back rotational stretches\r\nThe lower back rotational stretch can help relieve tension in the lower back and trunk. It also gently works the core muscles to improve stability.\r\n\r\nTo perform the lower back rotational stretch:\r\n\r\nLie back on the floor with bent knees and feet flat on the ground.\r\nKeeping the shoulders firmly on the floor, gently roll both bent knees over to one side.\r\nHold the position for 5–10 seconds.\r\nReturn to the starting position.\r\nGently roll the bent knees over to the opposite side, hold, and then return to the starting position.\r\nRepeat 2–3 times on each side twice a day.\r\n4. Draw-in maneuvers\r\nThe draw-in maneuver works the transversus abdominis. This muscle is on the front and side of the abdomen, stabilizing the spine and lower back region.\r\n\r\nTo perform the draw-in maneuver:\r\n\r\nLie back on the floor with knees bent and feet flat, keeping the arms by the sides.\r\nBreathe in deeply.\r\nWhile breathing out, pull the bellybutton toward the spine, tightening the abdominal muscles and keeping the hips still.\r\nHold the position for 5 seconds.\r\nRepeat 5 times.\r\n5. Pelvic tilts\r\nThe pelvic tilt exercise can release tight back muscles and keep them flexible.\r\n\r\nTo perform this lower back flexibility exercise:\r\n\r\nLie back on the floor with knees bent and feet flat, keeping the arms by the sides.\r\nGently arch the lower back and push the stomach out.\r\nHold for 5 seconds, then relax.\r\nFlatten the back and pull the bellybutton in toward the floor.\r\nHold for 5 seconds, then relax.\r\nIncrease the number of repetitions daily, building up to 30.\r\n6. Lying lateral leg lifts\r\nLying lateral leg lifts work the hip abductor muscles. These muscles support the pelvis and can help reduce strain on the back.\r\n\r\nKeeping these muscles strong is essential, as they help a person maintain their balance and can affect mobility.\r\n\r\nTo perform lying lateral leg lifts:\r\n\r\nLie on one side with the legs together.\r\nKeep the lower leg slightly bent.\r\nDraw the bellybutton into the spine to engage the core muscles.\r\nRaise the top leg about 18 inches, keeping it straight and extended.\r\nHold the position for 2 seconds.\r\nRepeat 10 times.\r\nTurn onto the other side of the body and repeat, lifting the other leg.\r\nPerform 3 sets on each side.",

        "description": "What Are the Causes of Low Back Pain?\r\nStrains\r\n\r\nThe muscles and ligaments in the back can stretch or tear due to excess activity. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the lower back, as well as muscle spasms. Rest and physical therapy are remedies for these symptoms.\r\nDisc Injury\r\n\r\nThe discs in the back are prone to injury, and this risk increases with age. The outside of the disc can tear or herniate. A herniated disc (also known as a slipped or ruptured disc) occurs when the cartilage surrounding the disc pushes against the spinal cord or nerve roots. The cushion that sits between the spinal vertebrae extends outside its normal position. This can result in compression of the nerve root as it exits from the spinal cord and through the vertebral bones. Disc injury usually occurs suddenly after lifting something or twisting the back. Unlike a back strain, pain from a disc injury usually lasts for more than 72 hours.\r\nSciatica\r\n\r\nSciatica can occur with a herniated disc if the disc presses on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spine to the legs. As a result, sciatica can cause pain in the legs and feet. This pain usually feels like burning or pins and needles.\r\nSpinal Stenosis\r\n\r\nSpinal stenosis is when the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Spinal stenosis is most commonly due to degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae. The result is compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or soft tissues, such as discs. Pressure on the spinal nerves causes symptoms such as numbness, cramping, and weakness. You might feel these symptoms anywhere in the body. Many people with spinal stenosis notice their symptoms worsen when standing or walking.\r\nAbnormal Spine Curvatures\r\n\r\nScoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis are all conditions that cause abnormal curvatures in the spine. These are congenital conditions and are usually first diagnosed when patients are children and teenagers. The abnormal curvature places pressure on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and vertebrae, causing pain and poor posture.\r\nOther Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other conditions that cause lower back pain. These conditions include arthritis, fibromyalgia (long-term pain and tenderness in the joints, muscles, and tendons), spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spinal bones), and spondylosis (a degenerative disorder that may cause loss of normal spinal structure and function). Although aging is the primary cause of spondylosis, the location and rate of degeneration is individual.\r\n\r\nKidney and bladder problems, pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and cancer can also cause low back pain.\r\n\r\nread more just download our app now \r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain app :\r\n\r\n- symptoms\r\n- signs\r\n- Risk and Prevention\r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- symptom \r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰\r\n✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Well, it's a just good app. But it might just be my tablet, but I ran into a problem no one else seemed to address. Whenever I have the app pulled up, the volume on my tablet is fine, but then when I exit the app or shut off my tablet while I am using the app then my volume is reduced to zero. It's usually not a problem, but when I'm say, listening to music? It goes completely mute whenever I have to import a picture or grab a reference. If this flaw could be fixed, that would be amazing.",
            "It's a good app. Though there isnt rly any difference between this app and the free version. The prime membership in the free app is about £3, but i had to pay £8 for this and still have tp pay £3 to unlock filters and materials etc. The only difference rly is that it has more filters in it, like anime background and manga background and others, which i rarely use",
            "Well I will be honest there's almost not difference between the free version and this one I mean yea there's no commercials on the top screen anymore and yea the tools you can customize them like you like and there free 24/7 but I was expecting more besides that I feel like I wasted money on it. It was my birthday money but whatever I still feel like I did I was expecting that I was gonna be able to edit my gallery but I thought wrong still the same thing Kinda sucks for me :(",
            "I love it!. Maybe add a feature where you can bind drawing tablet keys :3 with ease! Also If its possible,I wish this was available on Windows and macOS by just downloading it straight from the website and be able to link google play account or apple account or even make a IbisPaintX account so we could transfer our data either from free version or paid version of this app which I paid for xp.like being able to link our accounts somehow to those who paid for this vers. and free vers etc.",
            "I really like this app, but it's worth noting that its almost exactly the same as the free version! The only differences are that there are no ads and you dont have to watch hours of ads to unlock all the brushes. It has a lot of features, though perhaps not as many as procreate. Great app overall though 👍🏼"

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

        "description": "Stream or download these qigong video lessons to heal your Back Pain symptoms permanently. \r\n• Get immediate pain relief from your Back Pain.\r\n• New smaller app size~!\r\n• Learn to use qigong to promote healing.\r\nIn this hour-long video app, Master Yang presents gentle qigong exercises to help ease your Back Pain pain and speed your body’s natural healing. The exercises are simple to learn and enjoyable to practice, and you can easily follow along with Dr. Yang's demonstration. The movements can be practiced sitting or standing. \r\nIn the second half of the program, Dr. Yang offers pain-relieving massage techniques for yourself and with a partner, and shows important pressure points, or acupuncture cavities. A complete self-massage section is included which you may follow along to.  Massage is sometimes necessary to help improve your circulation to speed the healing process.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to prevent Back Pain or are suffering from joint pain already, qigong can help you with pain relief and stimulate your healing. For centuries, the Chinese have healed and strengthened their bodies with Qigong (chee-kung), the art of using the mind to direct the energy within your body to improve health and vitality. This program also gives an introduction to the general concepts of qigong and how it pertains to Back Pain.\r\n\"Qigong for Back Pain Relief\" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is also available as a DVD, book or ebook. \r\n\r\nLearn details about posture, the Qi (energy) circulatory system, and how to properly practice Qigong to improve your health. \r\nThe flow of Qi (energy) can be disturbed either through external trauma, such as an injury, or internal trauma such as depression or stress, or even just a sedentary lifestyle. When the body is energetically out of balance, this is when symptoms like aches and pain start to occur and we start to experience a state of \"disease\". Wherever you feel pain or tightness, your energetic circulation is stagnant, or even blocked. Stagnation is the root of injury or illness. Qigong meditation can increase the quantity of your Qi (energy) and improve the quality of your circulation.\r\nQi-gong translates from Chinese to Energy-Work. Qigong meditation creates balance in the body, both physically and energetically, by improving the flow of energy that circulates through the body in the meridians. We all have a \"life force\", Qi (energy) within all our trillions of cells, allowing them to function. Qi also regulates physical, emotional, mental and spiritual stability. Qi (ki in Japanese) maintains a homeostatic balance in your body.\r\nThank you for downloading our app!

        "description": "The largest nerve in the body is the sciatic nerve, and it is prone to sensitive changes which can cause excruciating pain which travels from the foot to the base of the spine. The condition in which the sciatic nerve cause this type of pain is called sciatica. Someone who experiences sciatic pain will find that the pain is centralized mainly in the hip area.\r\n\r\nThe sciatic nerve can become inflamed by simple things, such as pressure against it caused by wallets in your back pocket or wearing a belt too tightly. It is possible to correct these minor problems through various exercise, but only if you are under direct supervision of a therapist.\r\n\r\nStudies have concluded that sciatica sufferers can eat bananas or potato skins to alleviate the problem due to the amounts of potassium contained in them. Also, potassium supplements and multivitamins can also be recommended to help stave off incidents of sciatica in those who suffer from it.\r\n\r\nHydrotherapy is also a possible treatment for sciatic nerve pain. Taking hot soaking baths has been shown to give some relief to sciatica conditions. In this case, you would soak your body in water that is the same temperature as your body for about 20-30 minutes. After this, you would take a hot shower as you normally would do.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that therapeutic massage can aid in providing relief for sciatica; it is also said to prevent any flare-ups that could occur. Naturally, it is advised that you call a therapist to get the best plan of action for your particular condition. Generally, after a therapist will massage the painful area, it will then be soothed by rubbing the effected area with an ice cube or a lukewarm, damp rag.\r\n\r\nIt is important not to strain areas of the sciatic nerve through conventional exercises. Pregnant women should also be careful not to exert excess pressure on sciatic nerve areas. In both instances if care is not taken, the sciatic nerve will begin to swell and stimulate pain, leading into the hips.\r\n\r\nReflexology can theoretically help sciatica. Reflexology helps you to find certain reflex areas of the body in the shoulders and around the sciatic nerve. Your therapist would be the best help to find these points of reflex.",

The messages distil the essential components of everything we’ve used to help ourselves and one another, which will help you access the endurance and personal agency you need in order to successfully and powerfully navigate life, despite persistent pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paradox is; as a pain sufferer you have to actively do this work of pain management yourself, no one can do it for you ... but it’s too hard to do alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to this this on your own! We’ll be there like a guide, friend and support person on your side, as you learn to cultivate a way of living that’s meaningful and has purpose for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE APP WORKS\r\n\r\nThis App is like a resource in your pocket that you can use wherever you are, whenever you need. You can trust that it’s possible to put pain in the back seat of your life.

The messages distil the essential components of everything we’ve used to help ourselves and one another, which will help you access the endurance and personal agency you need in order to successfully and powerfully navigate life, despite persistent pain.<br><br><br>The paradox is; as a pain sufferer you have to actively do this work of pain management yourself, no one can do it for you ... but it’s too hard to do alone.<br><br><br>You don’t have to this this on your own! We’ll be there like a guide, friend and support person on your side, as you learn to cultivate a way of living that’s meaningful and has purpose for you.<br><br><br>HOW THE APP WORKS<br><br>This App is like a resource in your pocket that you can use wherever you are, whenever you need.

It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body. Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\r\nBack pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.\r\nBack pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed days off work. Additionally, it is the single leading cause of disability worldwide. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Back Pain symptoms, Back Pain management, Back Pain causes, Back Pain diagnosis, Back Pain Prognosis, Back Pain Epidemiology and history.",

        "title": "How to Cure Back Pain Relief",
        "description": "Back pain is pain felt in the back of the body. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected.\r\nThe lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body.\r\n Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\r\nBack pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.\r\nBack pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling.

        "descriptionHTML": "Back pain is pain felt in the back of the body. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected.<br>The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body.<br> Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.<br>Back pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.<br>Back pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed days off work.

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "The quiz is limited in questions. Did not have what i needed to answer nor did it have a lot of symptoms i experience. I couldnt change areas on the graph when accidently pressed it. Not paying for this app. If you cant ask the correct questions or give a correct answer its questionable anyway. You cant give a good diagnosis. Thought this was going to be something i could use in place of going to physical therapy."

        "description": "Do you know what is the feeling of sciatic nerve pain? Did you ever feel an ache so strong that it was very difficult for you to stand up? Often people experience unbearable pain just doing something very simple and they don't know why. When this happens, the most probable diagnosis is that of \"sciatica.\"\r\n\r\nHow can you identify sciatica? Sciatica is a condition in which what's called the \"sciatic nerve\" is affected by inflammation. This important nerve is positioned at the bottom end of the vertebral column and it goes down to the buttocks zone, and to various parts of the leg and foot.\r\n\r\nNormally, the symptoms are only felt on one side of the body and they can vary from a burning sensation or tingling feeling to a strong pain that crosses the areas above mentioned. It is possible, in some cases, that the sciatic nerve pain is present on both legs.\r\n\r\nThis is what scares many patients because they don't understand what's happening. The sciatic nerve pain can be so strong that they are fearing even to become crippled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pain, which is sometimes very strong, a sciatica sufferer can experience muscular weakness, numbness, and difficulty in moving or controlling the legs. It is very important to exactly identify what are the symptoms because the treatments for the sciatic nerve pain will vary according to the origin of the pain itself.\r\n\r\nThere are several different causes of sciatica ranging from arthritis to a slipped disc and from an abscess to a pinched nerve. Fortunately, almost always, sciatica is easy to cure.\r\n\r\nThe most common cure for sciatic nerve pain is to ease the pressure on the nerve root through surgery, drugs, or natural methods. If you want to avoid surgery there are many natural sciatic nerve pain cures. In alternative you can try a combination of natural and medical treatments that will often include physical workouts and stretching exercises.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an acute attack of sciatica it's better to lay in bed for the first few days to avoid irritating the sciatic nerve by getting up and down repeatedly.\r\n\r\nWarm baths are a pain killer for sciatica sufferers, at least momentarily. However it's better to avoid them if the sciatic nerve pain is caused by inflammation, because the inflammation will be increased by a prolonged exposition to the heat - and the swelling will increase too.\r\n\r\nA preferred therapy is the application of ice packs on the aching area for almost 20 minutes. This treatment can be repeated every 2 hours and it will be not so comfortable, but it will greatly reduce the swelling.\r\n\r\nAnother effective method to soothe the sciatic nerve pain, at least temporarily, is the use of mineral ice. On the contrary, the use of some drugs, prescribed by some doctors, can be addictive and, in some cases, very dangerous. As you probably already know many medicines have unpleasant side effects on your body.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the massage therapy that can be very helpful to avoid surgery and to better align your vertebral column for a longer time. At this stage, light exercises will be very effective, and so will be stretching. The goal of this physical activity is to prevent your muscles from stiffening.\r\n\r\nDownload the app to know more..",

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

            "Had to uninstall. I could never get it to tell me less than 5 days per week. I'm supposed to do 3 days per week, both shoulders, 2 sessions, 15 reps per session with resistance bands and eventually increase the reps and resistance. I couldn't get it to show less than 5 days per week no matter what I clicked on. I gave up. I just wanted to find an app where I could find my exercises and keep track as I did them, hopefully with video or images to ensure I was doing them right.",
            "Before using this app I couldnt drive or sit at all. I even struggled to use the toilet and tie my shoe laces. I spent most of my days laying flat or standing just to avoid the pain. Any bending or sitting position sent me into immediate and terrifyingly painful muscle spasms. Within 7 days of using this app I was recovering nicely without any more prescription meds. Within 6 weeks, my core was solid and I could start exercising, bending and every other normal activity.",
            "My literal only issue is that it doesnt have a \"both\" option on many pain areas, like knees. So I do 30 minutes on one side and reset it. When you start a plan, it gives you new exercises every day. You can go back and do old ones. Best PT, pain, gentle yoga app Ive used. Chronic Pain sufferer who cannot keep track of reps in sets is very pleased. Very sore, but not as bad as trying to do standard workouts. This is specific - functional exercises, not broadspectrum. Great for fibro/ddd/etc",
            "I was so excited about this app. I finally could do exercises for my specific issues. However the plan never works. My screen goes black right after the welcome video. I'm so disappointed.",
            "The screen is black and the session doesn't move forward properly. It's very frustrating."

        "description": "Do you suffer from back or leg pain and are in need of a diagnosis? LOBAK is a system based on the knowledge and experience of neurosurgeon W. Robert Hudgins, M.D.m, that helps you determine the cause of your lower back pain and what to do about it.  Finally, you can have access to an expert in spine problems with the tap of a button. Just answer some questions about your lower back and/or leg pain, do some simple tests on yourself as illustrated and you’ll learn the most likely cause of your pain and what to do next.\r\n\r\nLOBAK Features\r\n\r\nTo receive a scientific diagnosis, use this app to answer a series of simple history questions about your back pain, and conduct some in-home examinations with photo and video guides. Full descriptions and explanations are available throughout the app to help you understand terms or conditions you may not be familiar with. Once you complete a diagnosis, you can SAVE your results to review later, or share them with a trusted medical professional or back pain specialist. \r\n\r\nHow LOBAK works\r\n\r\nLOBAK uses a  unique classification system created by neurosurgeon Hudgins to tell you the odds that you have a lumbar disk protrusion (ruptured, herniated or extruded disk or disc, also called a herniated nucleus pulposus or HNP) and if you haven’t already had an imaging study (CT, MRI, or Myelogram), which imaging study would be best for you to get. It then computes the predictive value of a positive or negative test result, in percent, of a disk protrusion, using Bayes’ theorem of conditional probability. The app then uses decision analysis to tell you if you should consider having surgery.\r\n\r\nLOBAK can warn you when it’s urgent to see your doctor. It can detect many other causes of back pain, from simple lumbar sprain, to spinal tumor or fracture, spinal stenosis causing difficulty walking, infection, arthritis, and spondylolisthesis, and refer you to this website for further recommendations.\r\n\r\nAbout Dr. Hudgins\r\n\r\nDr. Hudgins is a Board Certified neurosurgeon now retired from practice. In 1970 Dr. Hudgins published results of his two-year clinical evaluation of several hundred patients hospitalized with low back pain and he then introduced the use of calculating the predictive value (PV) from 10-90%, of myelography in diagnosing a disc protrusion in the lower back.  The development of imaging scans and personal computing allowed him to upgrade that study to a computer program that included CT and MRI scans and could do the math calculations automatically. This program, called LOBAK, was accepted for presentation at a Symposium on Artificial Intelligence at the National Computer Conference in 1981.  \r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n\r\nLOBAK does NOT collect or share any personal information. LOBAK only makes suggestions for a physician’s consideration.  A doctor’s clinical judgment should always supercede CMD. Furthermore, in many lumbar disc cases the problem is mainly pain and the patient has the right to choose a treatment or no treatment at all, particularly when surgery is recommended. It is recommended that you only share diagnostic results with trusted medical professionals.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy using the LOBAK system, and are able to use it to find relief for your back or leg pain soon. \r\n\r\nVisit https://LOBAKapp.com for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Winnona Partners, LLC",

        "description": "First Trimester Pregnancy Back Pain: Causes and Treatments\r\n\r\n    - Causes\r\n    - Treatment\r\n\r\nFor many women, one of the biggest complaints during pregnancy is that aching back! Somewhere between half and three-quarters of all pregnant women will experience back pain.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s easy to pinpoint the cause of back pain in the later stages of your pregnancy (hint: blame the belly), what’s behind back pain in the first trimester? Here’s what to expect.\r\nCauses of back pain during early pregnancy\r\nEarly pregnancy\r\n\r\nThere are many contributors to the back pain you experience during pregnancy. For some women, it’s actually an early sign of pregnancy. If you’re experiencing back pain in the first trimester, there may be a few culprits.\r\nHormone increase\r\n\r\nDuring your pregnancy, your body releases hormones that help ligaments and joints in your pelvis to soften and loosen. This is important for the delivery of your baby, later in your pregnancy. But the hormones don’t just work in your pelvis. They move throughout your entire body, affecting all of your joints. In the first trimester of your pregnancy, this softening and loosening can directly impact your back. You’ll often feel this in the form of aches and pains.\r\nStress\r\n\r\nStress can be a contributor to back pain, whether or not you’re pregnant. Stress increases muscle pain and tightness, particularly in areas of weakness. If hormones are already wreaking havoc on your joints and ligaments, a little bit of anxiety about work, family, your pregnancy, or anything at all can go a long way to making your back hurt.\r\nSecond and third trimester\r\n\r\nAs your pregnancy progresses, other factors can come into play to aggravate that sore back.\r\nShifting center of gravity\r\n\r\nAs your belly gets bigger, your center of gravity creeps forward. This can lead to changes in your posture that can affect how you sit, stand, move, and sleep. Bad posture, standing for too long, and bending over, can trigger or worsen back pain.\r\nWeight gain\r\n\r\nYour back must also support the growing weight of your baby, which can strain the muscles. Add poor posture to the mix, and back pain is essentially inevitable.\r\n\r\nWomen who are overweight or have had back pain before becoming pregnant are at a greater risk of back pain during their pregnancies.\r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain pregnancy  app :\r\n\r\n- lower back pain early pregnancy \r\n- lower back pain pregnancy symptom \r\n- is lower back pain normal in early pregnancy \r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Diagnosis\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- lower back pain symptom\r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn how to recognize and prevent ovarian cancer in these lower back pain pregnancy Application videos.\r\n\r\n✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰\r\n✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰",

There was only 3 locations highlighted to chose from head neck and back.  I could not figure out how to click on anything else.  Very irritating. Maybe they just need to explain better for people who are not tech sauvy.",
            "The worst symptom checker app ever! Doesn't ask any comprehensive questions, just ones that have the most common causes of certain pains. Like shoulder joints for instance. Not every pain is caused by a broken shoulder joint. There are other things that go with that pain, not just bone protrustions, bruises, inability to move the arm. Get more comprehensive. Cover more symptoms because pain can cause more than just a few symptoms and is caused by more than just the most logical things. What was this created by, ER fast track nurses? GET MORE COMPREHENSIVE!!!!",

        "description": "What Are the Causes of Low Back Pain?\r\nStrains\r\n\r\nThe muscles and ligaments in the back can stretch or tear due to excess activity. Symptoms include pain and stiffness in the lower back, as well as muscle spasms. Rest and physical therapy are remedies for these symptoms.\r\nDisc Injury\r\n\r\nThe discs in the back are prone to injury, and this risk increases with age. The outside of the disc can tear or herniate. A herniated disc (also known as a slipped or ruptured disc) occurs when the cartilage surrounding the disc pushes against the spinal cord or nerve roots. The cushion that sits between the spinal vertebrae extends outside its normal position. This can result in compression of the nerve root as it exits from the spinal cord and through the vertebral bones. Disc injury usually occurs suddenly after lifting something or twisting the back. Unlike a back strain, pain from a disc injury usually lasts for more than 72 hours.\r\nSciatica\r\n\r\nSciatica can occur with a herniated disc if the disc presses on the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spine to the legs. As a result, sciatica can cause pain in the legs and feet. This pain usually feels like burning or pins and needles.\r\nSpinal Stenosis\r\n\r\nSpinal stenosis is when the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Spinal stenosis is most commonly due to degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae. The result is compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or soft tissues, such as discs. Pressure on the spinal nerves causes symptoms such as numbness, cramping, and weakness. You might feel these symptoms anywhere in the body. Many people with spinal stenosis notice their symptoms worsen when standing or walking.\r\nAbnormal Spine Curvatures\r\n\r\nScoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis are all conditions that cause abnormal curvatures in the spine. These are congenital conditions and are usually first diagnosed when patients are children and teenagers. The abnormal curvature places pressure on the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and vertebrae, causing pain and poor posture.\r\nOther Conditions\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other conditions that cause lower back pain. These conditions include arthritis, fibromyalgia (long-term pain and tenderness in the joints, muscles, and tendons), spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spinal bones), and spondylosis (a degenerative disorder that may cause loss of normal spinal structure and function). Although aging is the primary cause of spondylosis, the location and rate of degeneration is individual.\r\n\r\nKidney and bladder problems, pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and cancer can also cause low back pain.\r\n\r\nread more just download our app now \r\n\r\nwhat are you going to find out at this free app lower back pain app :\r\n\r\n- symptoms\r\n- signs\r\n- Risk and Prevention\r\n- causes \r\n- Treatment\r\n- FAQs\r\n- vidoes\r\n- Early Detection\r\n- symptom \r\nand more++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n✰✰✰ Support Us By Rating Us 5 ★★★★★ ✰✰✰\r\n✰✰✰ Please contact us first if you have any question! ✰✰✰",

        "description": "With the passing of time, we do not realize the amount of stress our bodies goes through. We tend to ignore the wear our body withstands. The knee, especially, on which the body weight stands, and which aids us in movements for our day-to-day actions, is one of the essential areas of your body that is impacted. Due to its nature this body joint tends to go through some form of suffering if not taken care of. There are several home remedies that can help you end the pain and discomfort of chronic knee pain.\r\n\r\nElderly people face a lot of problems like arthritis, among other things, that result in suffering. If the knee joint problem is not taken care of over a time period, it can cause huge and intense suffering. However, immediate attention and regular knee pain remedies can reduce this issue.\r\n\r\nToday, there are many herbal solutions prescribed by medical experts but one should refer to a doctor to know which one suits them best. One of the best known home remedy solutions is known as PRICE. PRICE stands for Protection, Rest, Ice, Pressure and Level. This is one of the widely accepted home solutions that is followed to end suffering.\r\n\r\nUsing products that contain relaxing essential oils can lessen the suffering due to injury or inflammation. Avoid using excess cream that may cause discomfort due to high temperatures that may burn the skin. Do exercises for your painful joints that target muscle mass around the knee and help in building up the muscle mass. While doing stretches be sure to go slow and do not over stretch as it may split a muscle. Proper and consistent use of the muscle mass that maintains the knee with exercise routines is the most vital thing to do to look after your legs from harm or injury. Weak and worn out muscle masses can't sustain the knee joint or act as a shock-absorber for the knee.\r\n\r\nWhen you experience a cramp, stretch the impacted muscle with one palm while you massage the center of the knee using your alternate palm. Then you should walk it out. Once an acute cramp is realized, steer clear of doing heavy routines right away. As an alternative, take a stroll for a few minutes to maintain the blood circulation back to the legs. You can also make a substance using castor, turmeric extract mixed in resolved butter or wheat. This paste can then be applied to the joint.\r\n\r\nBeing overweight is also one of the major reasons for knee joint pain and hence losing those excess pounds can help you to get rid of the chronic suffering. Try running, walking, or swimming, or whatever you are comfortable with and stay fit to steer clear of pain. During the winter, keep your knee heated and warm by using a wintergreen treatment as it produces a high temperature and reduces pain. If it's not adequate, then wrap your legs with heated clothes after applying the treatment.\r\n\r\nAlways consult experts before opting for any home remedies for knee pain as your knees are a significant part of your body and helps with body movements and other essential actions.",

        "description": "Low Back Pain Stretches - You want to maximize your performance and feel your best — but if you’ve got debilitating back pain, it can be hard to focus on anything else. The good news is, back pain relief is often just a few simple back stretches and exercises away.\r\n\r\nThere are a few back pain causes (like spasms, muscle strains, or disk issues), but the end result is the same — chronic pain that keeps you from living your best life.\r\n\r\nBecause back pain can be so debilitating, a lot of people turn to more serious interventions, like surgery or painkillers — but turns out, all you really need is a good stretch.

I picked up my shoulder injury by carrying the world on it for too long. I actually picked up my injury from excessive over use. I am a plasterer by trade (used to be) and the constant movement and rotation of my arm in a circular motion weakened the tendons over time.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I had to do was go see a doctor and in my case this was a complete waste of time. I mean, what in god's name is a doctor going to do for my shoulder I ask you...nothing but prescribe some pain killers, and I bloody hate prescription drugs. This is why I set out to get the injury fixed without the need for pill popping and you can too. Natural remedies for shoulder pain was the best option for me, but I must stress, it may not be for you. It all depends on the severity of the condition.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a few things I did to get my shoulder back to its peak performance. Just remember, if the problem persists and you feel the injury is very serious, you should go to a physiotherapist to get it looked at by a professional. If you have little or no money like me then you can try the steps below:\r\n\r\nStretching:\r\n\r\nThe single best solution to start with is to stretch those muscles and joints throughout the day. This has done wonders for my shoulder and I continue to use stretch exercises every day, 5 years on. I haven't had any muscle or joint worries since then so I recommend you buy a good book that teaches the basics of stretching and do those exercises every day from now on.\r\n\r\nHeat:\r\n\r\nIf you are having shoulder trouble (which of course you are) make sure to get a heat pad and place on your shoulder throughout the day. As natural remedies for shoulder pain goes, heat is a great way to determine how serious the injury really is. The heat relaxes your muscles and this alone could be enough to get your joints back to basics. Soaking in a hot bath once in a while can be great to ease any discomfort also. What I'm saying here is that heat is a great indicator to how serious the problem really is.",

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

        "description": "Did you know that the lower back pain is the most common reason for seeing a doctor in the World?\r\n\r\nMore than 85 percent of all people around the world will experience lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.) at some point in their life, and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet surgery or painkiller are rarely needed to treat lower back pain. So, what’s the answer?\r\n\r\nA typical response to experiencing lower back pain is to take it easy - either staying in bed or at least stopping any activity that is at all strenuous. While this approach is understandable and may even be recommended in the short term, when done for more than a day or two it can actually undermine healing. Instead, active forms of back exercises are almost always necessary to rehabilitate the spine and help alleviate lower back pain.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the best medicine for dealing with lower back pain is EXERCISE! Studies confirm that when lower back pain sufferers start a regular exercise program, they are more likely to have less pain, and be able to return to work and be active again.\r\n\r\nThe set of exercises presented in this app are suitable for people suffering from lower back pain (Lumbar herniated disc, etc.). At first you probably will not be able to do it like it’s shown in the app, but that's normal, do not despair and keep going day by day. And don’t do the mistake trying to do too much too soon. Always leave time for warm-up and cool-down before and after workouts for lower back pain.\r\n\r\nThe end positions of every exercise could be a bit painful. Please, do not overwhelm your back and stop when feeling medium to strong pain. It is recommended to do the exercises in the morning when the back is stiff, but it can be done when it is convenient. They can also be done 2-3 times a day.",

        "description": "Have you ever experienced aching pain in the back / buttock area that radiates down your leg? You may have sciatica. Sciatica is a common condition that affects up to 1 out of 10 people, typically between ages 25-45.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\nSciatica is typically felt as a dull aching pain to the low back / buttock area, that can at times be sharp, depending upon movement. It is generally on one side, but at times can be on both sides. Other symptoms can include numbness and / or tingling, radiating down to certain areas of the leg.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCauses\r\nSciatica is an entrapment and irritation to the sciatica nerve, which passes from the lower spine, down through the buttock and supplies the back of the leg down to the foot. Typically, sciatica is caused by poor mechanical movement of the hips, pelvis or lower back. This causes abnormal strain and stress to the gluteus and hip rotator muscles. Certain people are more predisposed to sciatica, because their sciatica nerve pierces through the piriformis muscle in the buttock, which makes it more susceptible to irritation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPain Relief\r\nThe good news is that over 90% of those suffering with sciatica will get better with conservative treatment, especially physical therapy. Physical therapy focuses on improving the mechanical movement of the hip joints, pelvis and spinal joints to relieve pressure on the sciatica nerve. Furthermore, since many muscles are impacted and often weakened, physical therapy helps to restore normal muscle function. This balances the spinal, gluteal and leg muscles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTry these 5 natural ways to relieve your sciatica:\r\n \r\n\r\nImprove your posture – One of the long-term causes of sciatica is poor posture. Make sure that you have a lumbar support in your work chair and in your car that you can take with you to different places. Look at the way your computer and desk area is setup. Avoid soft couches and recliners. Physical therapists are experts in ergonomics and can teach you the proper posture setup for workstations and home activities.\r\nChange your position frequently – Sitting puts direct pressure on the sciatic nerve. Therefore, it is important to change positions frequently. Consider getting an adjustable standing desk if you have to spend most of your day sitting at a computer. If you are suffering from sciatica, try lying down for 10 minutes, standing for 10 minutes and sitting for 10 minutes. Rotate this throughout the day as much as you can.\r\nTry magnesium – magnesium is thought to sooth irritated nerves and many of us have magnesium deficiencies. Try a good magnesium and calcium supplement to soothe pain. However, if you are on medications, consult your physician first.\r\nImprove your hip strength and flexibility – The gluteal muscles support the normal walking motions we perform everyday. They become weak and tight with prolonged sitting, especially at a desk job. This causes severe strain on the smaller hip muscles around the sciatic nerve, when walking or standing.\r\nGet your body mechanics checked – Most of us do not realize that we have made an adaptation in our normal movements, because of limited joint motion or muscle weakness. Our body is amazing at adapting to problems, however, it can only do this for so long, until abnormal strain and stress occurs. Having a thorough biomechanical movement analysis by one of our trained physical therapists, will pinpoint the exact problem that is causing your sciatica. This allows us to formulate a treatment plan that will help you naturally restore your movement, function and quickly relieve your pain.",

Diagnosis of acute appendicitis with appendicitis inflammatory response (AIR) score is also said to be more superior compared to Alvarado score. In &quot;Appendicitis Diagnosis - Acute Abdominal Pain&quot; app, the score will then be classified into three risk categories. In patients with low risk, outpatient follow-up can be recommended. In patients with indeterminate risk, in-hospital active observation with serial re-exams, imaging, or diagnostic laparoscopy, according to local practice are recommended. While patients with high risk, surgical exploration is highly recommended.",

Back Pain Tracker is an interactive app that helps personalize treatment.\r\n\r\nBack pain is a major and growing source of pain and disability.  The Institute of Medicine included “Comparing the effectiveness of treatment strategies for low back pain without neurological deficit or spinal deformity” in the top quartile of 100 research priorities in 2009. In U.S. national surveys, LBP is the most frequent type of pain, reported by about half of adults in the past year.  It accounts for 34 million office visits annually to primary care physicians. An estimated 7 million adults have activity limitations due to low back pain. It is considered one of the most vexing health problems of our time. Back pain most commonly occurs without leg numbness or weakness and cannot be reliably attributed to a specific cause (“non-specific back pain”). The optimal strategy for treating such patients is uncertain. The efficacy of treatments is moderate at best. A significant proportion develop persistent disabling pain despite use of first-line therapies such as analgesics, exercise therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy. Invasive treatments and surgery have limited efficacy and significant risks. Our goal is to help each patient with back pain choose the treatment that is right for them, and engage patients for long term self-assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)scores, potentially for more than 5 years, when many patients start reporting deterioration in pain and function following back surgery. BPT has the potential to help improve outcomes for patients with back pain.\r\n\r\nBPT as an interactive technology to help patients with personalized Shared Decision Making (SDM) in conjunction with their healthcare providers on the appropriateness of the wide range of treatments available for back pain.

Patients frequently hold mistaken beliefs about their diagnosis and risks/benefits associated with treatments. BPT helps align an individual patient’s values and preferences with the patient’s treatment choice through SDM. Unique features of great significance in the BPT are: (1) providing patients with information that balances risks and benefits of treatment options, (2) eliciting preferences based on realistic goals of care, and (3) integrating PROs in the decision-making process at the point-of-care.\r\n\r\nThe application was developed through a user-centered design approach to design the user interface for ease of use by patients in entering PRO data and to present time-trended PROs that are understandable for patients, including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients’ age, sex and other features.

PROs developed by the NIH Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain and the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computer Adaptive Tests (PROMIS CATs) interact with and “feed” the SDM process. In particular, the integration of individual patient factors adds to the risk/benefit discussion in the decision for surgery.

Though lower back pain treatment is available, it is important to understand and recognize the pain in proximity in order to select the best treatment. Lower back pain can occur any time and while doing any activity, such as driving a car, picking heavy objects, playing, or because of an accident. Lower back pain is so prevalent in America that at least 100 million workdays are lost every year and accounts for 15% of a person's sick leaves. That is quite a lot! If one does not receive lower back pain treatment on time, it might become potentially more damaging.\r\n\r\nTypes of Lower Back Pain Treatment\r\n\r\nLower back pain can be treated only when you have identified the origin of the pain. After you have identified the affected area, there are various options as far as lower back pain treatment is concerned, which generally depends on the severity of the pain. If you have a ruptured muscle or ligament, the treatment you would need would be completely different and best person to decide on the treatment type would be a spine specialist. One of the most common treatments for low back pain is acetaminophen. It is a pain reliever that is taken orally. This will relieve you from pain for a short period.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you pain persists, then other oral medications maybe prescribed, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs).\r\n\r\nHowever, the safest form of treatment is correct back exercises. They not only help in relaxing the muscles, but also improve blood flow. When suffering from back pain, the best resting position is to lie down on your back. Place some pillows under your knees, and bend your knees. This removes the unnecessary pressure and weight off your back, providing you with the much needed relief. It has been proved that back exercises are extremely helpful in providing relief against acute lower back pain. Then there is a heating pad, which is far more effective than ice packs and enables you to reduce painful muscle spasms and relax your ligaments\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload Lower Back Pain Treatment App now..",

But often also, trying to reach an object placed high or wanting to lift a load too heavy may be enough to cause a backache.\r\n\r\nHerniated disc.\r\n\r\nBeing injured or carrying a heavy load can also cause the sliding of an intervertebral disc or herniated disc. Thus moved to the spinal canal, the disc presses the nerves that generate pain in the back. Attention, with the age, the discs are altered, increasing the risk of sliding and thus of herniated disc.\r\n\r\nArthritis.\r\n\r\nCommon arthritis (inflammation), arthritis can also cause back pain. Ankylosing spondylitis, a form of rheumatoid arthritis, also causes back pain.\r\n\r\nOsteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nThis other common condition results from joint wear, which often affects the vertebrae and vertebral joints.\r\n\r\nOverweight.\r\n\r\nObesity is one of the factors favoring back pain. Indeed, excess weight exerts excessive pressure on the spine that can cause pain as well as arthritis (inflammation of the joints).\r\n\r\nPhysical inactivity\r\n\r\nLack of activity weakens the abdominal muscles. As a result, the pressure on the spine increases and can cause back pain.\r\n\r\nBad postures\r\n\r\nNothing like a bad posture to cause a misalignment of the spine, which forces the muscles and presses the nerves. These bad postures are frequent, during the simple walk or in sitting position, but also during activities of all kinds, professional and leisure. And they are favored by stress.\r\n\r\nAssociated diseases\r\n\r\nBack pain can be part of the symptoms of certain diseases. This is the case of fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, pregnancy, some infections and some tumors, including the spine.\r\nPrevent back pain\r\n\r\nIn practice, we can prevent back pain: physical activity, weight loss, good posture, avoid carrying a heavy load, fight against stress, etc.\r\n\r\nBut in case of persistent or recurrent back pain, it is advisable to consult your doctor in order to explore the causes and to set up a suitable treatment.",
