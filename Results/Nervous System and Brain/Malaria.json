There are not enough specialists in the world to diagnose malaria... and you can help! We combine the results from several players to obtain an image analysis as reliable as the one made by a specialist. \r\n\r\nNew: we have lots of players from Tanzania, so we have added info about malaria in Tanzania. We might add soon info about malaria in other countries, such as Kenya. We have also included basic info about how you can prevent getting malaria, either if you live in Tanzania or you are just travelling. \r\n\r\nMalaria is caused by mosquitoes bites. In fact, mosquitoes are the most mortiferous animals. They not only cause malaria, but other diseases as well: Zika virus, dengue, yellow fever...\r\n\r\nThe images you play with are photographies of real blood samples from patients from Mozambique and South Africa. While playing you will hunt for \"Plasmodiums\", the parasites responsible for malaria. The best you do it, the higher your score will be and the furthest you will advance in the game. Your goal? Find all the parasites in real blood samples from malaria patients. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the MalariaSpot Project at www.malariaspot.org\r\n\r\nIf you like MalariaSpot, help us leaving a review! And play our other game, TuberSpot\r\n\r\nThanks for helping us by playing! :)\r\n\r\n*Some images have been kindly provided by Dr. John Frean from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg (South Africa), and have been previously used to assess the possibility of using automated image processing systems to count the number of parasites in the research article \"Reliable enumeration of malaria parasites in thick blood films using digital image analysis\" (Malaria Journal 2009, 8:218).",

The most effective prevention measures include the use of mosquito bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticides to avoid the mosquito bites and to kill the mosquitoes and spraying the inside walls of houses with similar insecticides to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The most effective treatment for malaria consists in using a combination of several anti-malarial drugs, one of which is a derivative of artemisinin. Preventive treatment of pregnant women with anti-malarial drugs can also reduce the harmful effects of malaria both on the mother and on the unborn child.",

Almost all are in genus Anopheles, which worldwide is the only mosquito genus that transmits human malaria.

Three biogeographical regions are represented here in “Central America.”  The fauna of northern Mexico is very similar to southern North America, and that of eastern Panama is very similar to northern South America.  Since there remain many unanswered questions about the identities of many South American species the keys presented here will not necessarily work for eastern Panama.  \r\n\r\nThis key is based on Wilkerson and Strickman, 1990 (Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, vol. 6: 7-34) who used published literature and original observations.

The first mobile game was CD4 Hunter™. These games are primarily intended for use as a learning tool to supplement biomedical science curriculum in higher education, by intersecting science with engaging game mechanics.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\nMalaria Invasion is a 3-level game in which players take the role of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium in the blood-stage of infection. Specifically, players play as a Plasmodium merozoite that arose in the bloodstream of an individual that had been bitten by an infected mosquito. \r\n\r\nBy intersecting real science, with attractive visuals and animations, and simple gameplay, each game level teaches players about essential aspects of the complex mechanism by which merozoites invade RBCs while evading the immune system:\r\n•\tLevel 1, Circulation: The goal is to identify and infect as many RBCs as possible and not be detected by the immune system.\r\n•\tLevel 2, Attachment: The goal is to attach specific proteins produced by the merozoite to their specific receptors on the RBC.  The successful protein-receptor binding will increase the intracellular calcium needed to proceed with the invasion process.\r\n•\tLevel 3, Invasion: The goal is to develop the tight junctions necessary to engage the actin-myosin motor and drive the merozoite into the RBC.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:\r\n1.\tExplain the role of the Plasmodium merozoite in the progression of the blood-stage malaria infection.\r\n2.\tIdentify RBCs and their specific cell-surface receptors as the merozoite targets in the post-hepatic stage of the Plasmodium replication cycle.\r\n3.\tIdentify the key Plasmodium organelles involved in RBC invasion and define the function of essential protein ligands they secrete to facilitate invasion.\r\n4.\tExplain the role of the essential ligand-receptor pairs in the process of RBC invasion by the Plasmodium \r\n5.\tCorrelate the evasion of the immune system with the progression of the malaria infection during the blood stage of the Plasmodium replication cycle.\r\n6.\tIdentify important metabolic and structural changes involved in the process of Plasmodium merozoite invasion of RBCs.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nMalaria Invasion was designed and developed by faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (Mary Ann Comunale, EdD, MS and Sandra Urdaneta-Hartmann, MD, Ph.D., MBA) at Drexel University College of Medicine, and an undergraduate student from Drexel University’s Game Design Program (John Harvey). \r\n\r\nLawrence Bergman, Ph.D., James Burns, Ph.D., and Akhil Vaidya, Ph.D., also faculty in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, contributed their expertise on malaria. \r\n\r\nBrian Wigdahl, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Executive Director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease is the Executive Producer of Malaria Invasion.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project was provided by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease.

I've finished both Chapter 1 and 2 and I really enjoyed it so far. It looks like there's no Chapter 3 thus yet but I'm very excited for any updates! Big fan",

            "I love this game. Your new update about adding friends and inviting them is awesome. But.... We recieve the invite notification only when the are the lobby. We don't recieve notification when we are in match.This is the problem. You should have to solve it. We want to play with our friends. And for that you should make an update that we can recieve invite notification even when we are in the match. However, the game is truly awesome. That's all. Thanx....!!",
            "I logged into Facebook and I thought it was saving my progress until suddenly my entire account reset back to level 1!! I was Sgt major of the army and it took so long to get there. I was even saving up some cash to buy a crate and this happens??!!!! I don't know why it happened or how it can be fixed but I'm sure the devs can definitely fix my problem.",
            "Very interesting and fun game. I had installed this game a day before yesterday and I became a fan of it. But, but... I have a small problem with the game that when I start a online battle, sometimes it doesn't get started and it keeps loading and loading even at a high speed net. But it is ok. No issues in that. keep it up👍",

        "description": "Do you want to contribute to fight it? As a TuberSpot volunteer you can hunt \"bacilli\", bacteria that cause tuberculosis in images of medical samples. We will explain to you how to easily distinguish bacilli, which you wil have to \"point and shoot\". But beware, there are also \"artifacts\": they look like bacilli, but they are not! The better you do, the higher your score!\r\n\r\nTuberSpot is a \"serious game\" developed by researchers at the Technical University of Madrid. We are researching how fast and accurate is the bacilli counting of non-expert microscopy players and how to combine the analysis of different players to obtain accurate results as good as the ones provided by expert microscopists. This concept was already tested with the previous game MalariaSpot. Results revealed that combining 22 games from nonexpert players achieved a malaria parasite counting accuracy higher than 99%. This performance could be obtained also by combining 13 games from players trained for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis (TB) is the greatest killer worldwide due to a single infectious agent. In 2013, 9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from the disease. Over 95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 37 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2013. However, the diagnosis of tuberculosis can be a time-consuming process, taking up to 20 minutes. The standard method is to inspect visually with a microscope a sputum sample (mucus that is coughed up). Technicians have to look for bacilli, bacteria causative of tuberculosis, and count them.

Unique gameplay, Loved it. One problem I have completed the whole game,I have 23 out of 24 achievement so why am i not getting the 24th achievement i.e, to get all other achievements.",
            "Whenever I played the game, I didn't expect a cutscene in the beginning to tell Red and Blue's story. I was very surprised and amazed! Also, when I played the game, it was hard and challenging to get through the first levels, that's what's great about the game! I also lived the music in the background, it absolutely matched the theme of Red and Blue's surroundings through their travels. I would rate many more stars if I could, but it doesn't allow you to do that, sadly.",
            "I was very excited and the game seemed very promising. At first, it was perfect, then on level 2 I suddenly couldn't jump! At all!! Not even on previous level and the tutorials. So obviously I can't pass the level... Also, there are an infinite number of adds that are really long with no skip button that are driving me insane! The game is basically getting to the load screen, add, get to the level screen, add, click on a level, add, can't jump so you lose, add!!!!!"

            "Poor handling, lazy sound design and a visual rip-off of Limbo take away from the innovative gameplay elements. Disproportionately fast movement of the character comes after a lag. The jump responsiveness is not the same as the movement controls. Needs a consistent design language, such as texture of the edges, character and special elements. Simple, rewarding, relevant mood creating sound, consistently responsive controls would improve this game which has potential of being captivating.",
            "Ux absolutely horrible. I don't understand what the problem with implementing experience friendly controllers except developers had some super deep idea how to spend time for a kinda nise graphic even if this game pretty much similar to limbo, but screwing the whole experience with silly controls. And ads, it's just wonderful. Uninstalling.",
            "Great game however the ads are over zealous. Die, ad, next level, ad, choose a level, ad. I'd rather have an option to buy an adless version. The controls are a bit finicky. Slide forward and she goes backwards, finger right on the jump and she doesnt. Considering theres ads after dying, this creates incentive for \"glitches\" or \"errors\" to occur for you to die a few times to advertise to you.",
            "For a Limbo rip-off it's still pretty fun and creative, if glitchy. I'm pretty sure 4-6 is broken because jumping isn't consistent with how high you can jump, which is frustrating since I'm so close to finishing the game but the last level is impossible with the glitch.",
            "I cant even start to play the game. Less than 5 seconds after tapping the app to open it, it forcibly closes and does that regardless of any fixes I try including unistalling and reinstalling. Uninstalled for good from now on"

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium Salmonella typhi, also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate.

            "It was short, sad and emotional. I was just looking to play something like this which would get over quickly so I don't care about 20 min length. Even though it was not exactly a game and was story-driven, I enjoyed it a lot more than in actual game. The music score in the background plus additional sounds actually scared me. It delivered a good message despite how sad the ending was.",
            "When I played this game it touched my heart. I realised that war is nothing but disaster for innocent people. This game is really capable of best games ever. This is small but explains a lot about humanity and brutality. I hope those who died of this war they all are in paradise. Nice gamplay with a nice graphics. I love this game.",
            "Game? More like propaganda. Firstly the game is very short and seems like this was an attempt to spread propaganda rather than an actual game. There's barely anything to do except walk and jump and the character animation sucks. The creator desperately tries to evoke sadness by killing random characters, US-style warplanes are forced in the background but the result is laughable and seems desperate to spread a certain political narrative. Massive insult to Limbo, whose style creator has copied.",
            "Game is too sentimental and great. But two stars left , because the game completes in only two minutes , which is super short . Though it is a short standing game, it is nice and pathetic game which makes me cry , Iove it .",
            "This is the smallest but the greatest game I have ever played so far. It was a big eye opener and the ending made me cry. I have never cried by playing a game. Heart touching 💞"

Kudos BJR!",

However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",

It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

I enjoy the game the story is gokd but the only thing i don't really enjoy is trying to get you to attack other schools it goea against the story and all i usually do in theae games is try to make friends with other alliances to build up reputation. But i tried that last time i played...did not turn out as well as expected",
            "The game is great but I do have one problem. Some players are super rude and inappropriate. Can you add a report player button so that interactions can be monitored by the developers and limited to friendly?",
            "I started to play this game 3 years ago. It used to be fun and rewards from events were easy to get but not anymore. If you want to get all those stuff you gotta need to spend money. Devs keep releasing new stuff and new stuff means spending tons of money again. I honestly don't know why players still spend so big in this game when bugs are so terrible. Instead of fixing it, they are making it worse. No matter how f2p grinds all day, still not enough to keep up. Don't play this game.",
            "I have come to like the interaction between commanders. You will be surprised who just might help you. What I don't like is how the game incurage attacking other schools... That seems to be the real purpose of this game which is against the story!... And its no wonder they have to revise the cities because it gets really bad! To where no one has any compassion for their nieghboring schools."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

            "The controls are terrible, you constantly get spawned next to bigger players, and the battle royal mode doesnt even work. It loads for a second and takes you straight back to the main page. Waste of time. Also, every button you press will probably popup an add, 6 things you have to close out of, and then another add. I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",
            "Fun game but too many ads and popups about the VIP. If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",
            "Evreything is fun amazing and great. Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",
            "I cant express how much i love this came however a few days ago i bought a really cool skin which wad 3900 coins, i loved it but when i went on to play today the skin had disappeared and now i dont have it. I dont even have the coins back. Over all iys a really cool game🙂"

            "Very very very very slow. I only need to complete two birds and six dinosaurs. Figured out how long it would take. Gave up. I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

            "Ads are not intrusive and graphics is good. Some events are good. Game offers little room to progress for non-premium. You won't encounter the locations of screenshots advertised for a very long time. The game was choking at first with high production costs but then again its degrading now. Suggestion: you could make it a paid app. Anyway, thank you I've been spending less time on your game with all your changes.",
            "As of yet ive played a lot of shooter games and although this not an fps it is definitely one of the best shooters ive played on mobile so many options for where to go and fight as well as pvp and, co-op which is hard to find but this one a great story line that pulls you in Ive been playing for about a week and I consistently play games to get paid and a number of other gamez for other reasons and this one although i dont get paid to play I get into it and next thing i know its a couple hours",
            "Crashes are major problem here while matchmaking it crashes, During any battel it randomly crashes ( I am using S10+ with 4G network) also aiming problem when there are more enemies on the battelfield and few P1 bugs. Most of the time when i open the game it starts downloading data I dont mind it downloading data but time! it will take more than 10 minutes to download just 6Mb of data and for update it took 2hrs to just to download patch. Also there is only one pvp map, I spent money and I",
            "overall gameplay and graphic is good, but in PVP battle, I always fight with enemies who have powerful weapons through payment while I use regular weapons. I hope the dev will make the pvp match more fair and impartial. sorry for my 3 star rating. i will change it to 5 soon after your respond my feedback. thnk you",
            "Spending money on a game should be rewarding and give you an edge not a pre-requisite to game progression. Seriously there should be free rewards also and not just $£$£$£$£$ don't be lazy, make a game that rewards effort and make it playable!!"

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

I like how there are multiple evo branches and not just one. And the fact it has other planets to do multiple branches at a time is just plain AWESOME. And the thought put into the game, occasional updates, making sure it isn't buggy, deserves a 6 star if possible.",

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",

No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

            "I like this game very much. I finish very few games and it is also one of them. but this game is laging but my phone is 6 GB ram and 17 GB free space. I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

(more activities and games please! thank you so much) 😻🤍",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

And the juice that we made is tooooooooooooo good!! And the mini games in it.. I just love to play space trails in it!! Whenever I am free I start to play this game.. 😄👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍..

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

(This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest!

            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",

It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "I previously played when it was tied to Facebook. It was a good game then, but now it's a whole different game. The alliances, dragon rescue, etc. is fun. What ain't fun is the sheer number of dragons behind a pay wall (I stopped playing at the point they added legendary dragons), the amount pop ups before you can actually play the game with no way to skip all, having to click the \"feed\" button a hundred times, adds that come out of nowhere. There are a few more issues, but that's the majority.",
            "Love the game, but I hate that global chat was removed, we have chest cool downs, and I'm bombarded with ads. I used to watch ads for rewards, but these Yahoo ads are killin me. Now I'm even getting ads when I do basic things during the game, not choosing to watch the ad. Yahoo ads are annoying since I have to wait at least 50 seconds as well as periodically tap in order to finish the ad, but it was optional (watch ads for rewards). The game seems like it's dying out now..",
            "Right out the gate if you spend $30 and put it in the right area this game will be your favorite game. I truly feel that this game can be a game of the century but I don't like how everything costs so much money. if you're not careful you will nickel and dime yourself. It is an extremely fun and addictive game though and I wish they had it for console. There's a ton of variety a lot of different combinations of dragons mini games mini worlds and everything in between. Excellent game.",
            "So I love this game. I have since I was young. There are only one things I would like to address. The amount of ads u get when you first get on the game, maybe incorporate them into the game some way, but my whole family plays this also and hates the ads. Now I would like to suggest an idea. Therr should be a way to send gifts to your friends every day. Just one a day. And when u keep sending then it can increase ur friendship level and increase your rewards in ur gifts, ex. A dragon. Thank you!",
            "Love the game but as of the 4th of October, Australia started daylight savings and we accepted the fact that the event currency collection times moved from 4am, 12pm and 8pm (all EST), to 5am, 1pm and 9pm. It was an hour later, but we understood. However, recently for some reason, again the event currency collection times have shifted another hour later to, 6am, 2pm and 10pm. We are not enjoying this change and it is restricting us from getting the most out of the game. I hope it can be fixed."

We update the game every week so don&#39;t forget to download the latest version to get all the sweet new features and levels!<br><br>New to the game? Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",
        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

I realize only a few want to create a decent game. Everybody is all about the ads. Pump out crappy games. Deleting this game too. Received all the ad revenue from me you will get.",
            "This game is not really what it advises I was expecting something completely different. It's quite buggy. But I guess it is decent when comparing to other games in this category though I've played better games like this such as meeting cats or other animals where to buy your and such to get extra so I don't know I didn't play it too long before uninstalling but it just felt meh I had no interest in it.",
            "So I downloaded this game and so far I've really liked it and intended to beat it and show my friends but as soon as I got to oberon (the 4th world) I stop getting free spins and my rare mission is stuck at 12 hours except when I'm playing it, but it might be at 11 hours and 50 minutes when I leave the game and when I come back it will have restarted the time!!!!😡😡😡",
            "Used to be a fun game that I wanted to come back to but timers only work in-game which could be an exploit for boosters but it's a disadvantage for missions. Also I remember getting three spins every few hours which I guess doesn't happen anymore? Total downgrade.",
            "Doesn't add spins with time. It says you can have up to 12 but the only way to addore is to get to 0 and add 3 with an add. Also, no timers advance when closed...neither does income. Let me know of you fix these and I'll update this review. Unplayable idle at the later stages as it is..."

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

            "Like most of these HO games, things are frequently impossible to see, even zoomed in, on a phone. Other than that, great game. Enjoying it so far. Nothing innovative but visually beautiful and cute story. Edit; (Four stars down to two).Since the last update, buying extra seconds has more than doubled in price in an already VERY expensive game. More and more ads do not result in tools or time .",
            "This is a great hidden object game ❤️I've been playing for ab 2 years now, it is a little difficult at times but that's kind of the point,right? Great game, definitely worth playing. Only problem I have is it takes to long to get the items necessary to enter rooms,for example: ammo for hunting room,yellow balloons for Japanese garden other than that no complaints,ty for a great game!",
            "Good and fun game. The time limit is not enough for the rooms especially to twilight chamber room. Always want to buy extra 40secs from diamonds. Every single thing should be bought only via diamonds. No use of coins we earn. Match 3 are always the same. Again and again coming same levels. Irritating of playing the same again.",
            "This is my third review for this game.... I had only gave 3 stars last time because I was upset over an incident that happened with a purchase I made. After I left my review I noticed I had a response on here and that they would try to fix the problem, but unfortunately I had a phone issue and had to restart my game on a new phone, so it didnt matter anyway. I hadnt had any issues prior to that and I havent had any issues since then plus I absolutely love this game, so 5 stars it is.",
            "The game was pretty good for less than a week... The further you go the less free options are left. It's just became very frustrating and not really fun at all. Really hard to find objects and for every extra time and trophies you gotta pay or wait pretty looong. Well I had a good 1 week game. Ok 👌 not anymore I guess."

            "Bubble pop games are all different , but this game is special. Well though out colorful , much action , the baby dragon's and the game host are adorable . Many hours of points and enjoyment for all who participated in this game .",
            "THE best \"bubble pop\" I've played so far (about 10 which have been uninstalled). It's actually challenging at the higher levels and it took me 5 tries to get 5 stars just on level 20! Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",
            "The last 2 updates by developer were the same old version till level 665 and nothing beyond. Why released those useless updates then ?",
            "Love the game just wish I could land on the jackpot. Also I'm at level 525 and waiting for an update. Wow since I wrote this review I lost 550 coins and haven't even played since I'm waiting on the new update. I'm at level 645 and waiting for a new update to the app."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "The game is good and you get lots of updates every week but You can't grow up without paying thousands in this game . The strong players always attack the weakest player, there are already enough strong player in every city so there is no chance to grow up free or with small amount of money. I am playing this game more than 6 months and without paying i can't grow up. Don't waste your money. This games is only for those who can invest thousands of €€€€$$$$",
            "I liked the game at first, but I started having a bug in my game that hinders me from playing. I have invested alot in this game, and I thought it was going to be great. Instead, I have not heard a response from the company to help resolve my issue. I tried contacting through the game, email, Facebook, and even called a phone number that is disconnected. BEWARE DO NOT SPEND MONEY, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET HELP IF YOU CAN'T PLAY BECAUSE OF A GLITCH!!!!!",
            "I really like this game. But there are more problems. people are seen able to attack people and their truce don't expire. With every update, the game lags, then freezes before minimizing itself now. And 99% of the personal event rewards are not worth doing! Fragments are a joke when won. Especially for the yellow ones. And the buyable packs need a lot more in them to be worth their amount. City Chat is still not monitored! Do something!!!!",
            "I have played games similar to this but i gotta say i like the mafia thing. The game is fun by itself with the story line and evrything. But it is a little more fun when other people participate in the clan. But it defitately keeps my mind busy when its trying to run wild. Love the game though, lots of rewards also!",
            "I just installed the game maybe half hour ago, after 4 \"error\" during the install.

Closed it, assuming my phone was being dumb and now i have not been able to get back in the game. I get a black screen that keeps minimizing and refuses to play :( i have family who play the game so was really hoping to play, but this much bs already is not comforting start!"

Ps: please add a seperate button to start using the wide angle lens, it is soo frustrating when the camera switches to wide angle while zooming out. Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",
            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "This game is fantastic. I love it and I always play it when I'm free. The graphics are cool and I also love the weapons. But I didn't give you 5 stars because of the aiming system. For me the aiming part of the game is too difficult to use as compared to that of Call of Duty Mobile. If you can please upgrade it and make it like that of COD mobile, you will definitely get a 5 star from me at least",
            "I found this game to be the best amidst the best Game so far! The control and graphics are Ok.The only issue i will like to Complain of is about the Energy refill its just too short! Likewise the weapo are too expensive as well as the gold given at the end of every Adventure is too small! Please i will urge the Developers to do something before the game is been abandoned.Thanks.",
            "Very nice game with good graphic user interface. But my problem is level 8. I cannot defeat the terrorists coz they are plenty in number and have more sophiscated weapons than i do. Can u please help me cross that level?",

            "I've played it many years ago .....but accdidently it was deleted thus I did not installed it because I was checking other shooting games.. but those were to much irritating so I installed again ...so just giving it 5 stars...I would say that those who like this kind of games, just download it"

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "To be honest a lot of post on here about the game(mobile strike) being pay to win is pretty much 80% acurate there are some times your base is better but then there comes the dude that spent $20 more than you and just claps all your troops the game has alot of potentail but is already a failing game just becuase the game devs just want so extra money. So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",
            "Game is good, but when you start you encounter bullying by way of dealing with continue killing of your troops. Get a good alliance an you can build up. For starters slow to building up but worth the challenge.",
            "I played this several years ago and purchased quite a few packs. I have tried to download this recently and due to extravagant changes to the game, it will not even download. Disappointed.",
            "Just got the game today and already seems to be a lag in the game. Not sure whats going on, internet is working its just the tutorial part of it."

But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. \r\nWe present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). \r\nIn this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets.\r\n \r\nYou have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful.\r\n \r\nDeveloping games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them.\r\n \r\nOur games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime.\r\n \r\nFor the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time.\r\n \r\nAll you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist\r\n \r\nBe sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:\r\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3A\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudio\r\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames",

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "Ads at random time intervals are bad as it is, but if you can't get them to NOT pop up while players are in the middle of a mini game, just leave it. Losing points in a quest etc. because of an unskippable ad is pretty much the definition of annoying. Also the game got more money grabbing every update - no more update gems (instead Spike drops not even half the amount for a while), it's always the same few ponies on sale and everything else costs a fortune...",
            "I really like this game but one day it decide to forget everything i did and now i have to restart. Why cant there be passwords we choose to go with our usernames so we can log back in if it restarts or something like that. I am honestly upset about leaving a three star review but I have to. But other than that the game is great.",
            "I absolutely adore this app! I always watch the my little pony movies, seasons with my sister, and when I recently found out they had a game, I had to check it out. All the characters, their dialogues, is just spectacular. I love that there are many mini games in the game itself! Love the game.",

            "This app is so bad that (normally I dont review app) I had to review it to make sure everyone is aware about it. It's like talking to some Indian guy (No offence to India). This app is total waste of time. Dont download it. You will regret it. The functions are haphazard and the speech of the SimSimi is mostly out of the context. I had only began to chat and it called me darling and chatted in foreign language",
            "Simsimi is no fun anymore. It replied with \"yes\" \"no\" \"lalala\".. Lol.. All short sentences or only word. That's it. If you don't spend on the app. They won't even let you name your character, you have to pay for it. Lol. Don't install this. Tried the \"helping simsimi\" feature that says it rewards you talk more freely with limited time. It still sucks!!",
            "Can you please fix the bad word mission, because I can't get through it, it just says \" network is unavailable \". Please fix this.",
            "It becomes so bad , why should i have to pay 30 coins to open a chat ? , The app becomes boring and unrecommended at all"

This is a nice browser and all but I hate to admit that this doesn't really do well about it's ad management. I do know that I could the thing but I'm still reconsidering if it's actually a good browser or not.",

I really do like this app very much but something's buggy with the latest update. I have a pixel 4a if that helps. I will edit rating if it gets fixed. Update Oct. 6, 2020 I can now successfully export videos from app to device but not in the Life folder it exports to my Movies folder. Still cannot export pictures",

If you try to close (X) the box somehow, it won't close. Forces with pop-ups to download and buy VPN hub and b this browser to use it. REPORTED. Please report the browser as I have mailed to Google play store safety team. Also it promotes adult & vulgar ads. If browser wants to do business then it should be ethical and start by freemium not force them.",

Download wont resume unless you regularly click the \"download tab\" and go back and click again. Exporting downloaded media files are full of errors. Sad but true",
            "Used to be the best until the last update now u can't download any video anymore, i think the developers either deliberately ruined their app facing being sued by google or other apps for piracy or these company develop a new counter piracy software in which they have no solution for it until now, at least on the bright side they still let you keep your old videos."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

It ended up me and my other friend, that I was helping babysit, played it the whole time. We took turns playing the mini games, we turned our moy into a drag queen and made so many jokes. It is a simple game but it brings me so much joy. I recommend this 100%.",

But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",

Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",
            "Some ads are just a picture with 0 seconds and the game thinks I did not watch an ad, so I get 0 mana (failed to view ad) Please fix! I am really enjoying the game. I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

I'm getting high speed only when I call 199(Jio general helpline). After the call the internet speed becomes 2G again. This is so annoying. When I call that number, all of a sudden the range and internet speed increases. So horrible experience with Jio.",
            "Prime membership was deactivated without notifying the customer. As per terms and conditions if one downgrades or unsubscribe the plan then on the membership will be deactivated, but no where it is mentioned that if there is a gap of two recharges the prime membership will be deactivated. This was never commucated with the customers. Even your team is least bothered to notify the customer. Dropped and email but no proper service. What is use of collecting money and not providing service.",
            "The app was working perfectly, but then a couple of weeks ago it stopped updating the data usage and also how much data is left, then it stopped giving alerts for the next recharge which used to appear before when the due date approached. Please check it out and see what's the problem.",
            "It is a very bad networking site . In last few years, I have very very bad experience with it. The main problem is that, if you want to open Google,it takes long time to open. I have complaint many times but they always say that sorry for this we are working on it. It does not deserve even a single star. I think , I am going to mnp it in vi or airtel.",
            "I used Google Pay UPI @VPA to resolve late night payments via local banks. App is great. Only wish app wouldn't upload my contacts online, especially on Jiophone. This behaviour makes me distrustful of all apps, even if it is for getting names for numbers in Jio contacts database. Customer Service is awesome except for early days when we'd lose next day's data balance if we used full data close to the cut-off time of the daily data reset. Was bad on weekends! CS had no clue how to help & no data"

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

I like the old animation when you're dead 'cause its funny and one more thing fix this problem: even my player and the enemies are hiding from the wall or other object we can still shoot them and die! Not realistic! Not Good! But I love this game, just, if you want to improve this in the next update not just fix bugs. Thank you.",
            "It's a very nice game. Please notice this. But I think to make the game more refreshing is to add more guns, because it kinda gets boring, when you play it all day with the same guns. I really hope you see this, and please please please add more guns. Please? This is a 5-star to show you how good your game is, and it could be better, thank you for making this game and please add more guns, once again ❤️🌹",
            "Liked this game more than my heart and soul, but, a bug is really annoying me. If I do not use or open it two or three times without turning on the cellular connection, it is a download is going to be prepared and download paused because wifi is paused. After turning on wifi and connecting to a network, download paused because wifi is unavailable. Please fix this bug in next update or else my data pack will be half finished and I have to continously reinstall it.",
            "I like the game especially when playing with my friends,but i would like you to add a Counter Strike Global Offensive, features (for example, different guns have different weights,you can throw your guns,pistols except for knives, and most important in the bomb mode, the bomb has a timer/you have to wait for the bomb to plant). Please reply",
            "Its like CSGO, but not really, the bots are stupid, even in \"bomb mode\" because they get greedy on the bomb, please, make the bots like in the CS games. and they always stop when they are going to change direction, and its kind of awkward. and the guns are TOO stable, even the awp is. in csgo, the awp is not really stable while you are moving, in the game, it just deals more damage, and the fire rate is trash. hope you devs read this."

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

It is a really good game I honestly think it's nice. And amazing and very good.if you like the games of the game don't think anymore just download it it's amazing you would love 😆😆",
            "The ads are really obnoxious, there isn't much to do either. There is little to nothing to do in this game. There is just so many ads they are way too easy for a child to click on. At least have ads that are children friendly, not geico!",
            "Paid for a no ads version, but all the ads keep showing up. I bought it to keep my granddaughter entertained during a long flight and it was just annoying having to be dealing with ads every few minutes since she didn't know how to get rid of them.",
            "Like so many reviewers, we paid to remove ads and they are still there. They went away after we paid, but after we closed and restarted game again, the ads came back and aren't going away. DON'T pay to remove ads - it's a scam.",
            "Its a very cute game but i wish they would add more things to do but it an amazing game and if the add are bothering people they should tern off inernet/wifi. Its a great game!😁😁😁"

It focus more on nonsense stuff than the actual objective of this app. Plus, ads are so annoying. If it just stay on what it is designed to be back then, then it would be superb. Not recommended. 👎",
            "This app has been useful and I have been using it for 2 years, I think I have used it for too long that it doesn't work to some users anymore, it doesn't work anymore for me, my brother wanted for me to install Minecraft but he has so we instead tried to share it, it doesn't work, we tried it 12 times already, it kept saying \"receiver not found\" even we are on the same version of this app, it could have been a bug or other stuffs, but pls fix it!",
            "This app used to be great once upon a time. I've been using SHAREit since 2013, but it has just been getting worse over time. Now it's flooded with advertisements and unwanted stuffs. Even the main home page layout has been reduced drastically to make room for more advertisements. But the core feature of the app hasn’t improved at all. Extremely disappointed. Not recommended. There are much better alternatives available.",
            "When I first used this app it was so great and fast and I really love it. But now I higly recommend to stop using it because it has so many adds when you open the app, there are so many permisions requested unlike before and it has many unnecessary things added that should be not added. Every time they update, only the feature is upgraded and they forgot that the use of share it is to transfer fast and this is what the users expect, they should not put some unnecesary things.",
            "Now I really have to give it three stars. The ads are annoying me. The send and receive bottons are small. If I receive any app or game from another Mobile it doesn't install says base. And every time you give the same update. So can do something so it becomes popular like before. Please do something or I have to this app give it one star and install another app. I really love this sharing app. I am using it 2 years. But now I think this app has become an online video showing app. Thank you."

Somtimes it not works also and then the tanks sometimes dissapears when I go far and when I go close it shoots me.There is also one thing that Is so small and I was confused that from where I am hitting! And then when I get close I saw a tiny tiny things. But ok it's good.",
            "Game is amazing in this size. But a big problem is there which do not satisfy anyone and that is - no cloud saving our game progress. Kindly improve this so that we can continue where we left. Thank you.",
            "Gunships Strike 3D is the most fun I've had in video game of this kind. The Graphics are Outstanding, and the mission's get tougher, but that's what make it fun. Thanks too all involved in creating such a fantastic,adventurous game! Mark (GAMER)",
            "It is too good , I played it for almost an year one hour everyday. The creater deserves a salute for his creation. It is good and is entertaining as it is but the makers shall now give it an update introducing new helicopters and fighter jets. I would suggest them to make the graphics even greater so that it looks more real and introduce new missions online each week.",
            "This game is amazing and well thought of.. But am really pissed off by how expensive the helos are and after you purchase you have to pay equivalent amount of gold or diamond to get the weapons... atleast weapons should be part of the package. I bought the helo number 3 but after alot of struggle to but the tracking missile it failed to work.. Secondly it's hard to get the rockets... It's hard to get big guns.. Lastly I wish you would put an option of exchanging gold to diamonds and vice versa.."

            "Great simulator I've seen in my life in only 45MB. It is very great, but I request to developers please improve the steering response and when I want to see right mirror the camera quickly comes back to its position. So I can't see right side for long time while turning. And also please add (+ & -) in semi-automatic transmission. Overall game is too great and addictive. I love this game too much. Waiting for UPDATE..!!!",
            "Best bus simulator . surely download it but there should be changes. like first you should give guide how to play because while first time I was confused that where is bus terminal and how to start new route so you should do this changes but after playing for two to three time we can understand the game but in that money is wasted for fuel. other everything is best",
            "I love the idea of the game so much that it's addictive to play regularly and the reason why I rated 4 starts it's that the game steering wheel its not good and there's no bus stations that is empty no people waiting for the buses and no buses coming in and out of the station that way I rated 4. I'll rate 5 starts when I'll see those changes I hope the game programmers improve the game and thinks for making the game.",
            "Of all the bus games, this is the best game of my life. I have a lot of fun playing the game. However there is a problem that this game takes too long for passengers to get on and off the bus at some stations which is very annoying. I think the time should be reduced through updates.",
            "Its a very good game which make ma happy with its challenges on the road, but it occupy long time for the passenger to enter and depart. My suggestion is: establish a new system of taking a sample of few passenger in order to save time"

It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",

            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",
            "I find this game okay, I guess. It's just the ads that really ruin the experience for me. You get an ad every level, and each level takes less time than the ad you receive after."

            "Well, the combat is good, but to be honest, when buying guns, you buy dollars for it. And it's pretty annoying, because some players want to buy guns, then you make them dollars. IT'S pretty stupid, it's because, this Game Just wants a Promotion for money, and they just want to be really rich in doing so, Buying the guns for dollars is just a bad thing, even promoting the game.",
            "I actually like the game and dont mind the ads. The levels are pretty simple, but it's a decent mindless free shooter. However, I'm giving it 2 stars because the creators are clearly trolling players with annoying dog barks and birds singing songs. These sounds are completely too loud, annoying, and out of place. I mean -- a dog or bird is blowing up your speakers every 10 seconds while you're playing, and it's terrible."

Sunsets, snowflakes, beaches, scenic views, galaxies, zodiacs signs etc. just a few ideas 💡 and an ADD city icon to make a personal list because my family isn't where I'm located.

The app description claims this camera app is \"really really fast with zero shutter lag\" but that has not been the case for me. I want to be able to take pictures of my family when funny things happen. By the time this thing decides to wake up and take a picture, the moment is gone. I'm on a moto g5 plus.",
            "A couple days ago, while looking for 2 videos, I noticed that they'd moved from their regular places. I then checked to see if the Date stamp changed too and it did not. Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window. Updates that make an already trivial program require even more fantastically powerful devices to run... Your streaming pixel data to blit to the screen... Come-on!!!"

Went to the download manager, nothing downloading. Checked my videos, no videos. Went back to the browser (would be good if it remembers the last site visited) Tried another video to download. Nothing showing again, so I changed to download folder to my SD (cant create folder) I've more to add but I've maxed out the 500 characters"

            "The app is fine but I know it's a prank app but sometimes when u try to prank ur friend the lie detector just randomly picks the truth or lie!!! I tried this on my mom and first she asked a super easy that is true but it said that it was lie! And then she probably knew that was fake because both of us knew it was truth! But however the in total is fine not that bad but still I gave it three stars",
            "It is amazing not only lie detector it hass many options in it like trimmer with senssor,wip,funny sounds,piano and more must download",
            "its good if you want to have a nice laugh with your friends and to pass the time if your bored. its relly easy to understand and to control. but i relly think you should put in questions you and your friends can answer (if you know what i mean) it would make the game a lot more intresting. other than that its a relly good game and i highly recommend it. 👌💖",
            "AMAZING!! {And FUNNY to do on your friends.} I totally advise you to get it!! It is even FREE! I give it 5 STARS OUT OF 5 and it would be REALLY COOL to do at a sleepover. The only thing I suggest is that there are less adds {Which there really is NOT MANY ADDS I just don't like them lol} and that there are more pranks on there. And it would be PERFECTION if they gave prank ideas too. But of course, this is just my opinion. The app is great and I REALLY RECOMMEND IT. It is awesome and a GREAT way to prank your friends, and there are barely any adds. It is also FUN and EASY to use, which is why I give it FIVE STARS."
