        "description": "ALS AT HOME (ALS Testing through Home-Based Outcome Measures) is a research study aiming to improve how ALS is measured, with the goal of improving future research and making it possible for patients to participate in studies that are far away from where they live.\r\n The goal of this study is to improve the way we measure outcomes in ALS trials, allowing for future research to be conducted more efficiently. All participants will take measurements at home and electronically send them to the research team.\r\n What are involved: Several devices are involved in the study for 9-month measurements, including Air smart spirometer, Skulpt chisel, and Mi band. These devices have their apps and can write specific data into participants' Health App if allowed. This app will read these specific data from participants' Heath app if allowed and also shows these data as a list. Additionally, participants can review their data collection history by clicking the History button.\r\n Data transfer: Since the study requires participants' daily data, participants need to open the app and click Send button before they go to bed every day to transfer the data to the study database. If participants forget to send data to the study database, a notification email will be sent to participants on the next day to remind them for data uploading Privacy Since ALS AT HOME is NOT a treatment study, participants' data will NOT be used for any external resources and will ONLY be used for this study indicated in the informed consent. All data will be securely stored in a HIPAA compliant and PHI encrypted database Healthkit API data is used for the following: Forced expiratory volume (1sec), forced vital capacity- used to determine participants' ability to breathe. Active energy - used to determine participants' calories burned Steps, walking + running distance - used to determine participants' activity by the number of steps taken and the distance performed Body fat percentage, body mass index - used to measure participants' fitness levels as well as fitness changes Height, weight - used to measure fairness when comparing participants' fitness levels and fitness changes with other participants",

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode.

            "It is good that you can yourself create a vocab. Maybe to add 'to' to the verbs can create a confusion in some kids, because the may think that actual word is 'toeat' . I would add a possibility to add \"to\" or not. Would be also nice to vary a quickness of a pronounced word as some kids may not be able to get all sounds. It will be also nice to change as color of a word which is pronounced to focus on it and create a link between receptive and written.",

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",
            "It's great app for special child..but it's much costy to compare to other apps.if a possible prodive some more discount for monthly payment.....",
            "This program is absolutely amazing. I swear they have to be hypnotizing or drugging my little guy the way he calms down excitedly when its otsimo time..🤔 Im gonna need to get a lifetime license",
            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

We've contacted our provider with the problems, only to find we're far from alone! All casual signs point to shoddy processors. Poor reception, incorrect readings showing on screen. Just plain crappy junk. Not worth it!",
            "So I am at this very moment doing an upgrade for this app. When I am doing that I am reading the reviews ( kinda backwards I know) Well every review I have read is saying \"run away from these problems \" how it is working terrible and even that it cant be uninstalled. I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",
            "I'm giving five stars because on all my other phones I've had it works great. But, for some reason this phone the Samsung A01 it asks me to upgrade then tells me it's not compatible, why is this? It's a Samsung Galaxy phone.",
            "This is the phone from hell. Constant error messages so I can't open any unless manage to sneak it in . Now the sound has disappeared unless I put it on speaker phone. This phone was a waist on money just like all the Samsung products I have bought. I am in the hospital and need a phone.",
            "Phone never gets to 100%. Best is 89%. Very frustrating. Other than that it is a good phone. Does more than I ever use it for, though."

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

Unlike other torrent downloaders, it has a true built-in torrent search, an advanced download manager, music player and a media library. \r\n\r\nAll these features are wrapped into one free app, so you can find what you love easily, download music, movies and video directly to your phone or tablet - fast & with no download size or speed limits, and then create playlists to play your music offline without wi-fi or mobile data.\r\n\r\nFrostWire downloads super fast using a distributed peer-to-peer  (P2P) file sharing torrent network. By splitting the file into multiple chunks and downloading from many sources at the same time, it allows you to download media files as large as high-quality (Flac or wav) full songs or entire music albums, HD movies and 4K video many times faster than conventional methods. As a true free file downloader, FrostWire downloads all file types, so even though it is designed with primarily audio and video in mind, it can also download books, pdf documents, games, software, images and more!\r\n\r\nNOTABLE FEATURES:\r\n✔  True built-in torrent search\r\n✔  Easy one-tap download & seed (share)\r\n✔  Play while you download (sequential downloading)\r\n✔  Open any .torrent file or paste magnet link in Transfers to download any file you want\r\n✔  Select File Storage Location (Internal Storage or SD Card)\r\n✔  Download on Wi-Fi only (preserve mobile data)\r\n✔  Auto-pause downloads with VPN drop\r\n✔  Built-in fully featured music player with gesture support\r\n✔  Built-in media browser (rename and delete your files from within the app)\r\n\r\nFor more detailed list of features see http://bit.ly/frostwirefeatures.\r\n\r\nUSERS NEW TO TORRENTING\r\nFrostWire is a torrent downloader - it is not a content provider.

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

I'm hoping to see further integration of OneNote in the future. The user experience has been mostly smooth. Files seamlessly sync with OneDrive. Office Transfer is also a great tool built in to the app, which allows for fast media & file transfers between the phone and PC. Would recommend this app 100%.",
            "This app is quite better than WPS Office. However, Office Suite has better visuals and accessibility. Plus, it does not show whether the file was saved or not. And it doesn't have the discard option when you don't want to save a document. Tapping on texts zooms in and out and doesn't point to where I want to type. The app also occupies too much storage in my device. (500 Mb).",
            "Very helpful app. Word, excel, PowerPoint all under one umbrella. But has some bugs to fix. When I use app for some 5 minutes the app exit itself and I want to start from the beginning. This usually happens when I use word, or lens for some time. So please fix this. Or please add a auto save feature. And I can't find a scroll button in the .ppt files. So please add this. So I can scroll down slides very fast when I am not in slideshow.",
            "This Office application will not work properly after only a few days of use. I am unable to open this Office app on my Samsung Chromebook. The app opens for only a few seconds, then closes without notice. I have tried uninstalling the app, then reinstalling the app, but this action did not correct the issue. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing due to my reliance on this app to complete undergraduate coursework in Office type documents. I am unable to retrieve my documents.",
            "Impossible To Keep Same \"Theme Font\". I'm typing up songs I write. It keeps changing the Font of every single word; I must go back & put in smaller font so my words fit page. I changed over from \"Docs\" as the margins are better with Office, but I may go back. Office keeps putting a period after each Guitar chord (Letter) I write above words; Docs does same thing. Annoying. Not user friendly."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

I'm hoping to see further integration of OneNote in the future. The user experience has been mostly smooth. Files seamlessly sync with OneDrive. Office Transfer is also a great tool built in to the app, which allows for fast media & file transfers between the phone and PC. Would recommend this app 100%.",
            "This app is quite better than WPS Office. However, Office Suite has better visuals and accessibility. Plus, it does not show whether the file was saved or not. And it doesn't have the discard option when you don't want to save a document. Tapping on texts zooms in and out and doesn't point to where I want to type. The app also occupies too much storage in my device. (500 Mb).",
            "Very helpful app. Word, excel, PowerPoint all under one umbrella. But has some bugs to fix. When I use app for some 5 minutes the app exit itself and I want to start from the beginning. This usually happens when I use word, or lens for some time. So please fix this. Or please add a auto save feature. And I can't find a scroll button in the .ppt files. So please add this. So I can scroll down slides very fast when I am not in slideshow.",
            "This Office application will not work properly after only a few days of use. I am unable to open this Office app on my Samsung Chromebook. The app opens for only a few seconds, then closes without notice. I have tried uninstalling the app, then reinstalling the app, but this action did not correct the issue. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing due to my reliance on this app to complete undergraduate coursework in Office type documents. I am unable to retrieve my documents.",
            "Impossible To Keep Same \"Theme Font\". I'm typing up songs I write. It keeps changing the Font of every single word; I must go back & put in smaller font so my words fit page. I changed over from \"Docs\" as the margins are better with Office, but I may go back. Office keeps putting a period after each Guitar chord (Letter) I write above words; Docs does same thing. Annoying. Not user friendly."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "I love this game! They send free credits throughout the day. Of course using premium level and 4 cards is the best. But I've gotten bingos off of one card. Really have to try this one 🥰 10/29/29 Grumpy Cat is the best ever room. You definintly have to try it. Win clothing items, dress him up, take pics I share them in my FB story. GRUMPY always makes me smile. Seriously give him a try you'll be glad you did!!",
            "I loved this game, play it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times but after the update its always crashing on me. I had over 100 chips this morning and every game I tried to play it let me buy the game, start playing then freeze until it comes up game over. Im not playing again till this is fixed - a shame as it would have been a 5 star review last week ☹",
            "Wonderful game. Tired of having credits taken away every single day lately without the benefit of actually getting to play. Frustrated! Looking for new favorite game if support can't fix this issue. 🤬 I reach out to support and all I get is information on how the game works. No refund whatsoever on my credits. What a joke.",
            "Great game for bingo lovers, I play every morning with my cup of coffee and some Bingo Bash, love the game but getting annoyed with the gifts every night it comes thru get your gift and you hit the icon and no free surprise its been going on for weeks now, i play every day and do spend a good bit of money on chips, please tske a look or fix or I'll have to lower from 5 stars, i do love the game but very annoying",
            "I find it boring now. I love playing mini games as Rapid bingo or Grand tour. I always loose all my chips in rapid bingo. Very few times I won otherwise always loose chips.From last 6 months playing Grand tour but not won 300 chips reward. So stop playing that also. I find your team is only interested who put money. Those who play with free chips, your team don't bother. Now I feel depressed while playing this game, while loosing the chips. Earlier this game was my favorite."

        "version": "5.1.4",
        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we’re not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

No more Telemarketing, scams, or annoyingly winded people. Blocks Telemarketers! This particular app has worked for me over a year now. Still working like a charm. Ha, Make it year 3!The best company in the States for service is MetroPCS by T-Mibile. Service, connection, and the people are great. X 💚🐢",

Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",

            "Easy to use & good layout but it can be really slow & annoying, play up, run extremly slow & freeze, especially with larger documents & constantly keeps stopping to autobackup every few seconds. It's a shame as definatly used to be a much better app. Need jump to page number button too as slow to scroll though every page. It won't allow you to cut/copy text from Samsung Notes, so have to copy it to Samsung Email then cut/copy from there into Polaris. Text in columns can overwrite on itself.",
            "New update gotten worse on both laptop and smartphone, Columns setting shifts by itself; saved documents disappear; lags and stalls; just to make a few. License just renewed in July, You can have the rest of my year. I'm off and switching. sorry, I've tried.",
            "Horrible!! We were able to fill in things on PDF files, now you have to PAY for it!! Every 5 seconds an ad pops up telling you to buy this app!! Uninstalling NOW!!",
            "I like it, but can't trust it. Things just don't work. Spell check, is one, and from a quick search, android users have been complaining about this since 2012. It always wants to save in the cloud, no matter how hard I fight. It saves 80% of the time, the rest of the time the docs are lost unless you spot it. I like it, it's easy to use, but I just can't trust it anymore.",
            "Potentially a great document creator comparable to Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Notepad. But it has caused extreme frustration & bother, particularly by its technological dumbness. The Polaris System (?Server) seems to recognise saved files in a different order from which they were created. Obsolete versions of documents are perpetually being saved whilst preferred versions tragically are erased. (Is this a part of all 'Cloud' Software Systems?) Scrutinise 'Pricing Policy' before purchasing!"

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

I got in it and I zoomed in and it zoomed in way too much, that's fine one mistake okay? Then I tried to zoom out and all it did was draw, annoying. But that was the 3rd thing. The 1st thing was that when I looked at it before I got it, it looked like a copy of flipaclip.. like bro? Cant u get your own ideas!?!?",
            "The app was okay? But it was difficult to navigate. I couldn't figure out how to change canvas size, its near impossible to get any video that's more than five seconds, and the pre-set amount of frames is restrictive because i don't know how many frames I'm gonna use when I first start out. Please upgrade because Id really like to see this program get better..",

The opacity/brush size bars kept changing on their own, my frames would switch themselves, the sensor reading for the app is HELLA glitchy as it wont draw at all at times, and MY FRAMES DELETED THEMSELVES MINUS THE BACKGROUND. I cant even change my password! This app SUCKS!!!!",
            "Because of the newest update, this app is actually tolerable. The layout is much better, it looks a lot cleaner, and it's not nearly as glitchy. It's still not the best, but so much better than the old version. It does bug me that you can't have a pallete without paying for it anymore, but you do have the eyedropper tool, so i guess it's fine. It could be better, but actually seems usable now. It is missing a lot of features though, such as a line/circle tool, and maybe some more brushes.",
            "It was a very confusing app to use, for example the settings are a bit wierd and the fact that say I have my brush on level 5 and I want to erase something I have to change the thickness of it every time. So overall it wasn't a good experience"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "Its a really good game, the two reasons I chose 4 stars is well.... lets just get right to it, number 1, when i get on the loading screen it kicks me out and thats happened all the time. But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",
            "Dev replied with game requiring \"minimum rights\". Here is what they want from you when you start the game. Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",
            "Some ads are just a picture with 0 seconds and the game thinks I did not watch an ad, so I get 0 mana (failed to view ad) Please fix! I am really enjoying the game. I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",

This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",

Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

Same issues were happening with my brother's phone and the files were uploaded after an hour. Unlike him I am not having the time nor patience. I have high speed broadbanconnection.",

Now, I have to manually go in and check to see if the upload has been completed. 2. Many uploads, for reasons which can only be down to the app, are not uploading completely and failing. The thing is you never know until after think you have saved space in your phone and deleted the item.",
            "Upload from phone won't work. So hit and miss most of the time and often can't upload. Very frustrating. Edit: responding to Google LLC, I am using the app. On my phone. And I have tried incognito and the browser. Also how is a different network a solution? What am I supposed to do? Change my mobile service provider in order to use this app? I've paid for extra storage and honestly think this is a terrible app. I'd give it no stars at this point I'm so frustrated with it . :(",
            "This app is so disappointing..... immediately I installed it, I tried uploading a file on there...it just didn't work, I tried multiple times but still nothing. It was like a complete waste of my time and WiFi. I still haven't been able to make use of it. So I'll definitely uninstall it soon because it's simply..only clugging my phone memory."

Don't waste your time with this app. I used it without my case on an Pixel 4 Xl with location services turned on and the whole shebang. Avoid using.",

Stay full-time in a 36' travel trailer, and literally lay my phone on the counter and adjust the trailer to feel extremely level. GREAT APP, so far. I will probably upgrade if the price is fair.",

I want to be a member, but it just keeps saying \"we cannot create an account for you at this time.\" I even read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the app and they still wont let me. Also, when I try to play a movie, the ads are endless. And when they end, it's just a screen with the crackle logo. I would rate this -1/5 stars if there was an option to do that. Plz do not install. Download Tubi or Pluto instead.",

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",

The last time you gutpys updated two of my cameras stopped working on the app. but after two weeks or so they started working again. But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

            "I hate it. I bought this AT&T LG Phoneix 4G Android mobile phone and 50.00$ unlimited prepaid account card. My device was setup by AT&T Wifi support. I have had nothing but problems since I purchased this telephone and I've purchased the account prepaid card and I can't Register phone it says the phone number is unknown I'd really like to know what AT&T did to my telephone and why it does not work properly and why they won't correct it I'd really like to know because then they made me pay anoth",
            "Terrible app, please don't ask me to comment again I've made my point!!! Worst app ever!!! I'm not sure if I'm paying for it, but the developer needs to Improve this app before I give it 5 Stars!!! Every time I login, I get message, not available, very frustrating!!!",
            "Does not work most of the time. Never shows correct dates I connect to. All the complaint reviews and from all these people and no response isn't a good response. Please fix these problems",
            "Bloatware. Plain and simple, I'd remove if I could. Most phones automatically find available Wi-Fi signals. This app has never found one once. Pure bloat, and useless too.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

I now have to start over, I just paid for loosing my data. I would like my money back.",
            "Does not install fully without taking steps to install components, like language packs, for dictionaries to work. My odt files do not look or format the same on Chromebook (this app) as they do on desktop Open Office, but that might be result of lack of fonts on app. However, advanced users, who pay for full version, can probably make use of this app. Also, if you just need a word processor/office suite on Android for basic documents, this app is perfect.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right now🤷🏻‍♀️. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",

Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. 😎 This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "I couldn't get past the menu. I tried restarting the app a few times and it still wouldn't work. When the logbook menu loaded, the screen started flickering like crazy. If I was epileptic I probably would've had a seizure. The game keeps crashing, even on my other device. It's been nearly 2 hrs and I still cant play. But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",
            "This game is a great resource/idle type game. The ads aren't intrusive, the art design and sound are great. This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

            "Edit 5/10/2020: This used to be such a beautiful app, always used it in place of the regular Telegram. Downgrading the rating for two reasons 1. It hasn't been updated since May 2020 and 2. It still hasn't received the Video Calling update that the regular app has had for two months. What gives? I thought this version was supposed to receive newer updates sooner.",
            "It's great! But when i uninstalled and reinstalled, it seems to not work on my mobile data anymore. All my other messaging apps still work so the problem isn't with me. I've tried all the solutions on Google, like clearing cache, but no use. It only seems to work on wifi which is such a shame. Is there a way to fix this issue? Has anyone else encountered this too?",
            "Definitely lightweight and hogs way less resources in background compared to the official app and it's forks like Plus Messenger. Faster? maybe, the animations in TGX are slick but overall it's the same speed as official app. All I want to see is this app getting updates atleast once in 2 weeks to keep up with new telegram features, then it'll be perfect!",
            "This app is a very general and decent one to use for chatting to people anywhere in the world. The calls are typically much clearer than Discord, and I love the fact you can send videos of any size, unlike Discord. The reason it only gets a 3 star is because there's no option to delete/block contacts on the mobile version of the app. It's a hinderance to need to get onto a computer to remove a contact you don't want.",
            "It is very good app for sharing bigger file. At first it downloaded the file properly. But now it's not downloading.... It's a big problem. It's very difficult because I 've to reinstall and install every time so please rectify this problem. If it can't download any file and it seems very useless. So please rectify this problem as soon."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "App is decent for online meetings. I use it for group meetings as well as one on one collaboration. It is as good as zoom and some of the other platforms out there. I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "This app used to be good. I tried to add another bank account to use to send money and it did not accept my amount to verified. I never had problems sending money before. Then I tried the original bank account to send money. It keep saying cannot process try later. It's been three days and still now working. What a shame. I loved this app before, now I dont. Have to find another way to send money.",
            "There isno feedback on payments and I had to exit and re-open the app to see my payment was sent. The settings suck, if something is on and you want it off, the app starts linking your accounts instead of being an off or on option. Whatever you do, don't accidentally break their rules or they will ban you for life and not give you an appeal option. The parent company will persecute you of you treat anyone the way they treat their customers.",
            "I have had venmo since they started. I have not had any issues, I use it to accept payments. It makes budgeting easier for me as I use my venmo to make misc purchases that I don't want to use for my main account. No issues for me ever. I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again. Venmo saved the day! i love this app, my favorite part is the emojis!",
            "App keeps freezing and crashing out of nowhere. It still runs fine, but at least 2 or 3 times now I've sent money to someone and the app freezes while the money is sending. Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",
            "The app keeps freezing randomly all the time, while navigating through it. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it could be scrolling, tapping on something, etc., I have to restart the app each time. I also don't get notifications until I manually open the app. After which I keep getting the same notification again after I've closed the app!"

I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats £7 a month, over £80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",

            "Updated 10/31/20: The app is totally unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but I can't hit a single button on it. Completely useless. Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",
            "This is trouble some to me I have a 1 in the app window all of the time I do not know what to do of the 1 in the app window need help clearing the 1 in the app window . Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

            "Surprisingly, instead of playing games I often spend time answering a bunch of questions in this app. Overall this is a very useful application but my problem is when I answer in all subjects it often says that it's \"Rude\" and I have to change it, even though it's not at all rude but my words are not rude. Again, I enjoy this app but l'm just tired of looking for ways to answer clearly and that the questionaire with understand it more because of the problem. Thank you for this application",
            "This app is amazing. From the time that I had downloaded it , I cannot stop using it . It has provided me all the answers that I have ever searched (even maths with proper explanation) . You might not get ur answer some times so u can post a question and get an answer from other users. So you should definitely try this app. It will really help you alot🏆📖📚📑🎒",
            "The old version was very useful. But this one is not user friendly. Audio questions are only in hindi, if i ask in english it started to type in Hindi . And also the scan and solve option is also not working correctly, if i ask a question, it is diverting to other questions. The old version was very useful. I don't know what is happening in the new version.",
            "The app is awesome. The problem is with the latest version of android. There is a bug. Eveytime i work with formula tab, the app crashes. Also you can make improvements towards making inserting formulas much more easily and conveniently. The idea of app is good . I myself contributed answers. Please fix this issue as soon as possible in next update at earliest.",
            "This is a really great app! Ever since my modules came, I had trouble answering them. When I searched on Google for one of my questions, I found this app. I downloaded it and it is amazing! Random people started answering my questions, not only have I got my answers, but new friends as well. I hope this app wouldn't have any problems in the future. Thanks!"

I mean every time i have to install themes. What non sense. Also, i cant sort apps as per latest, favourites, new, etc. App needs improvement.",
            "I really like that you can sort apps and folders in a custom order in the app drawer; one thing nova launcher can't do. But unlike nova there's no tabs in the app drawer (even though it's in apex classic?) I guess it's one or the other? Also you can't stagger apps on home screen (subgrid positioning, placing app between cells). My only other wish is an option for a-z on the side in the app drawer instead of fast scroll bar, in the vertical layout. But it's a great app! Devs Plz consider? 💙",
            "If there were 9 Dock Rows, this game would be perfect. When I set up my devices, I use a 9 home screens. On the bottom I put the Widget Folder organized according to what's in each home screen. It would just make it so much easier. I'm willing to take screen shots of my phone and tablet for the Developers,,,",

I've tried pretty much every launcher, but they were either incompatible with my tablet, too confusing to figure out, or just wouldn't work with other apps. I use it with an icon app called Saturate and a clock widget called \"Cute Clock Widget\". I can now personalise my tablet to my heart's content!! 😊💙",

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",

It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",

Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",

        "description": "VOCALYX is a powerful, but easy to use, Augmentative and Alternative\r\nCommunication (AAC) tool that utilizes pictograms, photos, and text to allow its users,\r\nsuffering from various speech difficulties, to easily communicate with those around them and\r\nto make daily progress on their path of speech rehabilitation.\r\n \r\nVOCALYX can be used for both children and adults who suffer from the loss of\r\ncommunication or language. It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of\r\nmemory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with\r\nlow-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from\r\naphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering\r\nfrom MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with\r\ndeafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t\r\nknow sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.\r\n \r\nIn short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization\r\n(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and\r\ncommunication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a\r\nphoto, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX\r\nsays the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice\r\nof either the user or someone close to him/her.\r\n \r\nThe parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This\r\nincludes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful\r\nfor people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the\r\nsynthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual\r\ncommunication.\r\n \r\nThere are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as\r\nABCD and QWERTY keyboards.

        "descriptionHTML": "VOCALYX is a powerful, but easy to use, Augmentative and Alternative<br>Communication (AAC) tool that utilizes pictograms, photos, and text to allow its users,<br>suffering from various speech difficulties, to easily communicate with those around them and<br>to make daily progress on their path of speech rehabilitation.<br> <br>VOCALYX can be used for both children and adults who suffer from the loss of<br>communication or language. It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of<br>memory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with<br>low-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from<br>aphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering<br>from MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with<br>deafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t<br>know sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.<br> <br>In short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization<br>(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and<br>communication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a<br>photo, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX<br>says the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice<br>of either the user or someone close to him/her.<br> <br>The parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This<br>includes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful<br>for people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the<br>synthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual<br>communication.<br> <br>There are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as<br>ABCD and QWERTY keyboards. When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have<br>the option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading<br>your own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like<br>ARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.<br> <br>An internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration<br>and the initial set up.

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

It's weird that you have to use gems for outfits the he apparently bought for you. You have to use diomands to flirt, have sex, go on a date; pretty much anything to make the storyline interesting will cost you diamonds, a lot of diomands!",
            "The game is fascinating I like it so much. But there is one problem that's making me to hate it.The app keeps on clashing when I open it. I've updated the app today & I've not played since morning bcoz of the problem I've spoken of . So plz help me fix it up so that I can at least play it tomorrow or the day after plz! Plz! Fix it up I don't want to end up deleting the app",
            "I would like to complain that I cant get to read Painted Soldiers (a romantic story). I have used the key to unlock but it take time to download the content. Since I'm using my house WiFi and it's speed but from today it has problems. If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",
            "I understand the world is just slowly starting to develop an open mind. But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend 😉",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw! You must download this app !"

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "It is very good, there is good editing in it, it is available for free in everyone's phone and it also looks good editing the normal photo, but it really takes backup so I liked it This is a gallery, it is very good to save photos and it also has edits, it really keeps updating, so keep updating it, then you get to see new features and I like it too That is why I did not force stop it and I am using it, I would give it 5 stars but due to the lack of any more good features, I will start it only 3",
            "I really can't say that I love the way this app works. It's not at all intutitive. There's such a disconnect between my sd card and my photos on my phone when I'm in the photos app.. I don't really get why this has to be so difficult? It'd be nice if every pic or video the phone has access to (on device or on sd card or in other apps, etc) would just come up when I go into the photos or gallery app. It's like a mystery I have to solve any time I'm trying to work with this app! Thx.",
            "This update is the absolute worst. No longer are the folders small, easy to navigate single pics, but now the first dozen photos from each folder, filling the entire screen, with a tiny label... I can't just tap a pic to open the folder, now I have to scroll through pages to find the folder I'm looking for - plus, other than \"camera,\" everytime I open \"Photos,\" the folders are going n random order - and there's no way to alter or customize the view. Thanks for making garbage! 👍",
            "mostly positive. i like that it keeps my photos on the cloud and that i can use google apps to switch info from phone to phone. but my pixel 3 had an issue with this app where it restarted randomly as i was backing a LOT of stuff up to the cloud and about a 3rd of the photos were corrupted when it started back up again, even on the cloud, even on my phone. also, it says in the description of the app that you can upload unlimited photos and videos for free but you really only get 15 gb",
            "Good. But we need an option where you can manually set some photos to be saved in full resolution and the rest in high quality (free tier). So that the pictures that the user don't want it compressed can be availed in full resolution but the other pictures can be compressed and saved in free tier without using up the GBs allocated to and account. Right now the entire gallery gets uploaded on full resolution, when you change the mode."

I uninstalled/reinstalled the app with the same results. I need this to function as I use it to take notes in meetings. This is installed on a Chromebook running the most recent OS.",
            "Recent update fixed issues I was having with trying to type, but then OneNote would close. Only giving 4 stars as I would love to be able to have some keyboard shortcut functions available since I am using a Pixel Chrome Tablet as if it were a PC. Otherwise, I love using OneNote.",
            "I've wanted to take digital notes for a while, but I havn't been able to find an app that was efficient. This is the first app that has worked for me, and I absolutley love it. The color choices are awesome, and I love the ability to type, draw, insert pictures, and so much more. I would 10/10 recomend this to every android user.",
            "The major problems I've been facing while using OneNote on my Samsung Tablet are - 1. Closing a notebook takes a lot of time. 2. There is no way of knowing how much is synced and how much is not. 3. Syncing takes a lot of time too. 4. They have given a provision of deleting a notebook from OneDrive, but it doesn't really go away from OneNote after deleting. 5. It doesn't work when the device is connected to Internet. It keeps lagging and sometimes even crashes.",
            "Best Note App Ever. It sync to most of my devices. So I do not need my specific device to retrieve all my notes. It works even better with paste it notes. So handy for short reminder. I do online recording video and OneNote sync well with my phone and desktop. So I don't even need to buy additional USB writing pad. My Note8 and now Note10 will do the trick! Highly recommended for those taking a lot of notes and also using Windows to sync 'among' devices. My phone, laptop and desktop!"

            "Best free coloring app I have used to date. I like all the pen/brush options. Along with the option for paint bucket as well. And that the undo is more then just the last stroke. I would like to see the paint bucket come with a percentage fill, not just 100% fill. And like to see a floating undo button. I would like to be able to create a permanent personalized pallette of colors. I like to use same color schemes. The more I use the app, the more I enjoy it. Very Relaxing!!! 👍🧡 🥰",
            "I am a novice at drawing /coloring on my tablet and smartphone. I Using this user 👤 friendly site to create is one 1⃣ that I am looking forward too!! I have mental health issues ( bi polar, ADHD) ;I have heard that coloring, drawing and setting up a new place in my journey to explore the possibilities. Also, I journel and put a lot of time in my Christian life. Basically by default I will be happy 😊 to be able to make a positive impact in my life with words and color!! A daily gratitude list.",
            "AWESOME app that I just discovered purely because of the fact that I bought a new phone.. Decided to give it a try just since I was bored at the time and since I actually didn't have a clue what the app was about. I started a drawing and now I can't stop.... (All good things!) I'm an artist anyway, so this is a great way for me to get the ol' artistic juices flowing when I can't have any of my usual art supplies with me. Only suggestion: WE NEED MORE COLORS TO WORK WITH! Mettalic, Matte, etc.",
            "Good app... My problem is how do we thichen the pen and adjust it accordingly in the settings. It's really bad. Can't even sign in with my Google account. Next, when you tap the back key it ussualy asks you to save it but sometimes it doesn't. Give it 5 stars if you fix these problems. Otherwise a really good app. Glad I found a art app by samsung. Sorry now it has signed with my Google account.",
            "It's good but not great. A major issue I have with this app is that when in coloring mode the color pixilates when you stop coloring and then start coloring again. It doesn't do this with drawing mode. When I first start coloring it doesn't pixilate. Only when I leave and come back to it. It makes coloring small areas almost impossible."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",

You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",

It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",

All of the content in the game can be enjoyed by players regardless of their budget. It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",
            "Lots of bugs. Lacks instruction. I have everything that is says for Hydroponics (something needed for the game) yet fails to let me make it. Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

The app should run smoother than ever. <br><br>Plus... we added a sleep timer feature for premium users! Go to settings to check it out.<br><br>If you have any feedback or questions, please reach out to us on Twitter at @audiomack.",

            "Best. App. EVER!! Its amazing! Sure you cant download as many songs as you want, but they are just making buisness! Furthermore, its just great and I am listining to it as I am writing this. I can't think of a better app, spotify is way too expensive as I am a kid. But this here is just an amazing legend. It gets my 5 stars. (It deserves infinite stars though)",
            "I really hate the fact that you know have to upgrade to premium to download as much songs as you want, it really sucks, I've had this app since 2017 when you didn't have to be premium, kinda sucks now you have a limited amount of songs you can download. Also adds are getting worse and worse, need to fix that",
            "audiomack is usually a 5star App ...However, this new upgrade which only allows you to download a certain amount of premiums downloads before forcing an upgrade .... which once was free causing my rating to be as is... i am a long time customer and once im able to download an unlimited amount of download w\\o seeing certain songs being characterized as premiums my rating will increase significantly!!!!!",
            "If I'm being honest. Don't understand the complaints. The app devs need the money that they get for premium, limiting the offline Playlist to 20 isn't bad because you can still have an online one. You just need internet to play the songs and most people have data so I don't see the big deal. The app is good, you find new artist, remix and really anything you want. The staff is monitoring the app constantly from what I've seen and overall just works as a good music streaming app.",
            "First. Anybody on this app that is looking for a Apple music replacement is lame; thats why excluscivity has a fee. Second, if you use Live Mixtapes but are tired of the lack of currensy, this is the type of release access you need. Finally, I use more Audiomack than the LiveMixtapes App, the Apple Music app, because apple is...corporate. Eventually they'll pick it up but Audiomack to me is still getting the links to the streets. Like that Zayetoven release, i cant find it anywhere. Thank you."

            "It's a great and helpful app. I only have two complaints: 1. It should be easier to organise your list. I want to put the titles in a custom order, because sorting by rating puts them in wrong order due to multiple titles having the same rating. I also think the lists should instantly update when you give a new rating, now I have to wait a while before my list gets updated",
            "I have never had such a great, useful, dependable, easy to use, informative, and valuable app. Valuable I have won a few bucks having IDBM as my personal bet settler. You should try it, you won't regret it. I continue to explore this app and find more things I can do with it. I really can't say enough about my IMBD app",
            "Best app ever for film or TV lovers. Truthfully use this app multiple times a day, loads over an average week. Amazing for those \"what have I seen him/her in before\" moments; also those \"who the hell dat\" moments. Also settles many marital disputes for couples that watch a lot together. Great for watching suggestions and I especially like the Prime recommendations as a Prime user. Trailers are also useful. Goofs are funny to watch out for, location & OST details Great too. Love it - thank you.",
            "I really like this app. I can watch tv shows and movies for free. I have read several reviews about problems playing trailers or anything. I have not experienced any of these issues. Everything has played perfectly. I have only been using this app for a little while but its worth having.",
            "Could be a little less glitchy and more user friendly but overall great app. IMDb is the best! Better than Rotten Tomatoes by a mile for sure. I have been using IMDb for twenty years now and they've always proven to be the best in collective information about a movie, celebrity, tv show, etc."

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

            "This is a frustrating app. On one hand, on one of my devices, this app is great. It runs properly, is decently clear on what everything does, and having the peace of mind that my photos are safe is nice. On the other hand, on another device, this app crashes every time I try to move photos to a different app, is slow when doing anything else, and ends up wasting my time.",
            "So far I am LOVING THIS!!! I have only just begun using OneDrive, not knowing entirely what it was to begin with. Now I look for it wherever I am. I can open ANY file from pretty much ANY device! Word, power point, excel, etc.! I find that impressive. Especially since it's Microsoft. Like, I think Google tried to do the same thing but something just doesn't feel right over there. This is where it's at. Hands down. So far I highly recommend.",
            "I don't understand what's happend with this app. It worked perfectly fine and then Samsung backup switched to using one drive and it just isn't uploading anything right, it's not uploaded and new pictures from the last month since it change apart from some pictures from a year ago. Then it's saying it can no longer back up from and SD card? There doesn't appear to be anyway to change back and it's not clear what I actually have backed up now. So disappointed.",
            "Setup trying, should be made easier. Sometimes it takes days for uploads. Amazon is good for auto uploads. Making sub- albums is nonexistent (I used to keep info on leases, rent receipts, complaints, etc. in separate albums then group them under 1 album). Even Google changed that capability. I can't deal with these egomaniacs deciding what to do with my pics.",
            "Works ok except one annoying issue. The file dates displayed appear to be the dates the file was initially created and not the date the file was modified/synced. You cannot tell if file is modified until you open and inspect it. This problem is unique to Android version. Works correctly on all other OneDrive apps on other platforms (IOS, Windows, etc)."

I can't hear any music play at all rather it's the entry song ,or the music for the jukebox , please fix it , also I can't into the market place even if my WiFi conction is on ,and working right . Other then that I really like this game have it for the ps3 ,and now for this it keeps me besy . Hope this helps",
            "Oh this is the really really good game if you get to know it. That's a pretty good game I gave it four stars I would give it five stars well because I'm on Android and I can't get achievements and I can't see my friends when they're online :(. I wish I could earn achievements so I can get points too will be a lot easier for me. I hope soon Android can earn achievements if you do let it please and let us see our friends online too. If you can fix that.",
            "Really an amazing game. I've never found a game that's better than minecraft! I love the fact you can play with your friends, enable TONS of resource packs and let your imagination run wild! I think this game should be free so younger children can experience it themselves, and help their creativity improve! One glitch I need to report, though. Whenever two of my friends are on my friend's realm, I can never join, and never can my friends. I hope you can help with this, thanks.",
            "I love this app. I have played it for many years but recently it hasn't been working. Everytime I try to sign in my xbox account it takes me out the app and tells me the app stopped working. I reset my device 10 times. I even asked my friends who play it if it was working for them. It wasn't. This started happening after the recent updates.",
            "I'm very happy with this game it was worth my money, but every time I open minecraft it doesn't work and I have to close the application. This is although the first time it happened and hopefully the last. The problem isn't fixed yet so if someone could help me please do. UPDATE Even with the new update it still doesn't work I hope you guys will fix it. It freezes every time I open Minecraft . EDIT: it works again. If you have the same problem watch a YouTube tutorial. Worked for me."

            "It's honestly addictive once you get the hang of it, which doesn't take long! And so far it's easy to level up and progress in the game unlike other games like this. Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",

            "I've been on and off with this app for years. It's had so many changes throughout the years but this latest version has got to be the worst. The latest interface is just clunky. The old one was better. Another thing: there was two versions of this app. The original version was this free one. Now it's not free anymore? How is it that you guys are putting a premium on this one when you already made another pro version that you had to pay for? Just keep this one separate and free.",
            "Wow... just wow. Downloaded app a while back, and was pretty good! Unlocked all the fx options by watching videos, and was able to actually use the app.new update comes in, cant do anything but watch ads. Now even the previously free fx effects are now \"premium\", and whenever you click the fx tab, it brings up the subscription page, interrupting your doing. And when you exit THAT add, ANOTHER one comes up! Worst update ever.",
            "This pirch bar is a joke, can barely set the bpm right without using the sync button. You ruined it, the previous one was way better. It's nice that you can apply 2 effects on a track at the same time unlike before the update, but now they're smaller which makes it harder to use with my chunky fingers, i often screw it up because of that. The eq slides were narrowed down, bad idea. The automix button just simply shouldn't exist or place it somewhere else where you can't press it by accident.",
            "Don't even bother updating it, when you try to change the tempo/pitch of the song, its too hard to get it accurately to where you want it to be using the bar, the way it was before was way better and the worst part is they charge you for recording, they'll do everything and anything for money....",
            "I absolutely love love love this app great for beginner djs or just to have fun my only problem is that I cannot record anything I mix through SoundCloud even if I do buy premium. if there is a fix for this I would love to hear about it also would like to see more personalization opinions when you do pay for it"

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

Should I try to calibrate with the cursor in the middle of the screen? The consistency is challenging Please understand the importance of my ability to use this technology. NOT only would this give me the opportunity to access \"the world\" from my bed, after my physical assistant has left for the day. If we can work out the kinks in this system so it is efficient for me, I would purchase the full software program",
            "I would rate 5 stars, but the calibration must be corrected. When I do the initial face scan, it calibrates over to the left, rendering the right side of my screen impossible to move the cursor over without struggling and doing a lot unnatural body movement. I am on Asus ZenFone AR. I really do like the app, and will recommend it to anyone.",

            "Its really nice because it challenges you to build it better and better. The only 2 problems i have encountered with this game is that it goes from easy to super hard too fast! There should be more intermediate levels and slowly introducing inclines, jumps, obstacles and free standing bridges. The camera angle, OMG! This is such a headache. If you want to see where the stress is at, you have yo change it to 2D which is almost 8bit MarioBros 1 style! Its ridiculous! Still great tho!",
            "too many ads,a game that is literally pay to win,ripoff of polybridge,honestly this game is just the poopy mobile version for polybridge,and stolen textures,those who left five stars either 1:never heard of polybridge2:think this games better because it is free and not all people can install polybridge,and i heard one person talking about how polybridge is a ripoff of this and they said \"polybridge was made:2018 and this game was made: 2017 so dont believe that dont Confuse this for polybridge",
            "The developer of this game does not respect your time. This might be the first time in like 10 years Ive written a review complaining about ads but this is ridiculous. Random 30 second ads when you lose, when you win, when you start a level, and literally being forced to watch ads to get enough \"coins\" to unlock a level.. & its legit 2 and a half minutes of ads to unlock the level. Its pure greed, its outrageous and ruins the game. It's fun tho if you dont mind watching ads more than playing it",
            "I think I downloaded the Screen Saver version, because apparently, when I open the app, it NEVER gets to the main menu, or not even a loading screen. It just shows 2 islands, a \"Build a Bridge\" logo on the bottom left corner with some clouds passing by in the sky. I kept my phone on, charging, for the next few hours to see what would happen, and nothing. Still a screen saver. Tried uninstalling, formatting, restarting, but nothing.",
            "I really like this game but since I'm young I don't have money and can't get the extra worlds and I beat this game fast. I ran out of levels to play because of the expense of the extra levels so can you possibly replace the payment with ads or make us beat each world to move on to the next one? Thanks in advance!"

            "There's actually a lot of educational and helpful people on this app from all different backgrounds and it's actually incredible to be able to learn from them. It can also just be fun and silly. It all depends on what you're looking for. I only have one real complaint and it's that I wish you had more characters to write a comment with. I'm an extremely long winded person and the limit makes it feel difficult to communicate efficiently for me. I haven't had the app for very long though. 🤷🏾‍♀",
            "This app is amazing !!! It keeps you very entertained and you can spend hours on it without being bored , but there are lots of problems , minor problems and big problems. A big problem for example would be Tik Tok deleting random videos which really annoys me , some of my favourite videos have been deleted for no reason , and another huge issue is the community , the people in the comments always say mean stuff to the creators of that video and it really bugs me because I feel so bad for them.",
            "I really enjoy the app, very much, but there are a couple/few of things I would love to see updated: *1. Make it possible to edit a video after posting (too many times I have made a last minute change, which (for whatever reason) changed the placement of an embedded text. SO IRRITATING); *2. While in the editing process, make it so the timing duration doesn't disappear; *3. Disclose how one can become \"verified\" (this actually may be in the app somewhere, but I haven't been able to locate it);",
            "I love tiktok. But sometimes the app freezes and its sorta annoying. And why should we have to link our phone number? I can't text like that. And we should be able to have multiple accounts with the same phone number. I know that could be dangerous but you could notify the other account(s) with the same number to see if it is the same person. And until this is fixed I will rate one less star every month.",
            "I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "The cloud itself is pretty fine, but the app is weak in terms of a cloud app. It can't check file checksum to see if the file already exists so that it doesn't re-upload it. Multi selection of the items are not possible, you should select them manually by hand, which is funny! Recently I've seen some instances of users complaining that pCloud or other 3rd parties scan your files to check if there are any so called \"illegal\" files and they terminate your account. This is the opposite of privacy!",
            "No way to upload files and open new folders. Yet it reads: \"created folder\": \"uploaded files\". Network ok. Other fully functional apps. Update today 22/10/2020. Version2.11.2. But already with the previous version ie version 2.9.1 I had the same problems. But momentary, not like today. Thanks for the attention. Good job . In Trust I always leave 3 stars. GOOD DAY .Review update 22/10/2020 All solved for now. Thanks for the effort, the commitment and the seriousness. Let's go to 4⭐",
            "Looked far and wide, this is the best there is. If you are like me and have bunch of media on your external hdd which makes it very inaccessible to you. Then this is for you, the media streaming facility is excellent. I've compared it's lifetime plan against Google drive, idrive, purchasing a nas. It's without a doubt the most sensible choice.",
            "Still now it's good to use. But one think I want to know,after installing day to now present time, how much MB (products) I upload on this \"pCloud\" free cloud storage,I found 1 thing is not going well, For ex:- supposed that, I upload 20 MB on this 'pCloud\" store,but the problem is I see,everytime I upload any file any size,after completing upload,if I go settings-app & notification-click on this \"pCloud\" I see as much (MB/GB) upload on \"pCloud\" storage,this app size will also expend the same.",
            "This company isn't able to repair a bug in the audio player reported 8 months ago. After I sent a reminder I got a reply saying: \"Be advised that your feedback has been provided to the Android team months ago. You don't need to worry, we are already working on a new and improved Audio player.\" - That was in July, no change since then. They claim to be \"a young forward-thinking team doing our best to make a significant impact on the rapidly growing IT market\". Not like this, guys."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

But when I accidentally deleted it and just downloaded it today, it made me let Picsart have the permission to access my Storage. I went to settings to change the permissions but it wouldn't let me, and now I can't do anything. For now I'm giving this 4 stars overall. FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!!!",
            "Okay so, I like this app. I love how you can edit your photos and videos. It's just why cant you edit your videos without the text costing too much. Like I want to edit my videos and add text and it cost too much with the premium. But overall theres not a lot of problems, it does lag so it always mess up my edits and I have to start over. BUT I recommend this app for anyone!👍🏾",
            "been using the premium version for over a year. good but has issues. sometimes slow, sometimes doesn't see images (even those you just edited with this app), even after multiple refresh/reopening the app, the gallery, cleaning the cache and even restarting the phone. no other pics editing app has this issue on my phone. will switch to another app once i find the better option. p.s. they should definitely work on their text editing options. poor so far.",
            "well, it's always going back while im editing, but maybe it's just my phone. it's just MY experience with it. no need to get worked up by it. Edit: well, I've changed to my 4 stars to 2 stars because it won't let me edit. It won't let me do anything. I thought it was my lack of storage space, but I've fred up a lot and it still won't work.",
            "The app is quite good but the only thing I hate is that when I actually want to apply effects to a picture, it keeps loading and then they turn me back to the editing page. I reinstalled the app but it still does the same thing. Please fix this issue real quick or I might uninstall the app"

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

            "Overall good game, there's a wide option of stylization choices for your avatar and profile, and so many games to play. The only things I have to complain about is the lag (when playing on mobile), and the fact that they got rid of xbox chat. Personally, I don't really care about the xbox chat, but some games I need to at least see the chat to know what's going on. But still, a wonderful game.",
            "Pretty good but serious flaws. People get locked out of accounts constantly due to the broken captcha (I've experienced it) and little to nothing is done with security. I'd expect a multi-million dollar corporation to take security more seriously. The games are pretty fun, though you do see scams daily. Moderation is pretty good, and the moderators are quite quick to take down inappropriate games. I've seen many instances of silly bans, however, some do get their accounts back! Solid 7/10.",
            "This is a great to get boredom out of the way. It gets you attached to it. • Different variety of games • Create your own games • Edit your avatar • Make new friends • Safe chat is available if you put your age under 13 It's just a amazing game, there will be some bugs, but it's okay. Only because of the bugs am I giving it 4 stars. If you can fix at least the log out bug, I will definitely give it 5 stars.",
            "I like this game so far. But when i play a game it takes so long to load. And sometimes i get disconnected. I have internet in my home. And also, It kicks me out for no reason, When i play adopt me or others. It automatically pushes my character out of the game. Please fix these bugs. Its so annoying. 😁",
            "Omg this game is amazing i've been playing this since i was age 4. The grapics and quality are the only thing that is missing. The lagg and bugs need to be fixed, but I still recommend. I would like it if other people played the game. Great opportunity, it gonna to be the worlds best game ever who ever made roblox, u need a trillion dollars bc u are the best!!! Please join my robux group \"mano county swat team group\" i give robux every week. Thanks"

            "Send SMS from your browser + basic Sync. If you're looking for a basic unintrusive & considerably lightweight app, this is it. For me this has taken over the heavily restrictive (bandwidth-wise) competitor AirDroid. Update: recent updates have disabled their site connecting to the internet. Updating my rating from 4 stars to 1.",
            "It's great to send and receive text and MMS messages from your computer or table (with a keyboard). I love the ability to download the photos off my phone for easy forwarding. I've been with the for four years and if want more features to really customize your experience, I highly recommend the Pro version. However the basic (free) version is really powerful for being free.",
            "Love this app. I spend a great deal of time on my PC and not my phone. To be able to get instant updates on text messages or even send from my PC is a great help. I also find it much easier to text back using my keyboard than my phone. Downloads images and videos sent to your phone. No need to transfer files to my PC. I highly recommend this app. There are versions for your phone, tablet, Gmail, and Facebook. I've ran across a few glitches and tech support jumped right on it. NO taking forever for someone to tell me to reboot a device which is so annoying. Nope. They wanted to know exactly what happened so they could reproduce the bug and fix it. It's not very long after when a new update is released to fix the issue.",
            "I've been using this service for many years now and it has made life easy. as a realtor texting has become a main form of communication this has made it easier to communicate with multiple clients seamlessly. I can also print out a thread for my records. Update... recently I forgot my phone at a friend's place but didn't realize it until morning. After they had both left work. Which meant I'm not getting my phone back till they get home later that day. Thankfully, I could still text!!",
            "Tired of knowing I paid to have this app work 1/2 the time. Want my money back and to find a New, more reliable app. Update: months later, still tired of having to relink the app to my computer multiple times/day. It gives out at the most inconvenient of times and can take minutes to days for it to start working again - even after uninstalling and relinking. If I hadn't paid for the app, I wouldn't complain. But since it's not free I feel I have the right to ask that it be reliable. When it works, I LOVE this app! It's fabulous! But they need to ensure it's reliable."

            "So many people say that it's way too hard to get brawlers. I think that this game is perfect and it is nicely balanced (except for amber). If people are getting brawlers once a week, then it won't be as exciting when you get a new one. I have 15k trophies and 39 brawlers. That is kinda low for my level, but other than the fact that I want a new brawler, this game is 5 stars.",
            "Lots of different and interesting characters, hampered by an unbelievably toxic community. I have had countless matches where people are sitting in the spawn, doing nothing for the entire game. Or they gather up a bunch of gems and sprint into the enemy base to hand them over. There is no way to report them, so they just keep getting away with it. And that is if you don't get matched up with your level 1 and 2 team against some level 8 opponents, who can one-shot-kill you every single time.",
            "Honestly I'd give them 5 stars but the internet connection is SO BAD!!! (At least not all the time) even when I'm in a room with full connection it still lags like crazy and I'm unable to play. However everything else is AMAZING I would definitely recommend it, it has amazing updates every month and a cool youtube channel where we can follow their development the only thing that is bothersome and prevents me from giving them a 5 stars is the lag of course.",
            "The game itself is good but the \"Brawl-o-ween\" skin challenge skin should be changed to unlimited tries because sometimes when you loose its not your fault that you loose. Also, if you handing out a free skin that \"everybody can get\" why have the 4 looses and your out? It kind of defeats the purpose of handing out the skin in the first place. The fact that im not able to get the skin is making me want to uninstall it.",
            "POOR MATCHMAKING. (Example: Teammates with low power level vs Enemies with Level 10 power level). SHOULD ADD REPORT SYSTEM. I've encountered many teammate in brawl ball just to throw the game. (They take the ball and shoot it at our goal, that would make the enemy win.) Do the developers know hoe frustating that is? AND! they will be your teammates again in the next play!! 🤬 Please don't just add more events or skins. Please add some features that would make the game better."

Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... I like this app, but it's appears when using other apps. Otherwise, interference, unpredictable behavior and isn't stable.",
            "The app is pretty good. As it says it's fun to search and it's life too? The only issue I have is with downloads. We can't download pages like we can in chrome. Since there is no multiple tabs option there should atleast be an option where I can save some sites I wanna read later. If this is the only browser app a person uses like me then it's not so efficient. Coz I disabled chrome since it takes up a lot of space. Please do something about this. Else it's a great app. No complaints. 😄",
            "This app is great, and a great alternative to Chrome and Google. It is very easy to use and it has Google Assistant built into it when you voice search. It has a lite, incognito, and normal. It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much",
            "Excellent for many features, 1. Multiple sessions, each search in a separate window. 2. Lite mode, pages load faster and easier to read 3. More convenient search box location. 4. Opens some of the blocked sites in some countries. 5. Has bookmarks to open frequently visited pages. And more... The bad: if you left the app to another app then back, the page reloads again, very annoying when you read and compare two pages.",
            "This is a very good light browser. Very fast, always loads practically instantly even on my 4 year old s7. Very helpful side features; though I dont use them very much personally, I can see that many people would. It gives relevant search suggestions. Some features such as advanced searches are missing, but I have found that I mainly use this for finding a fact or an image quickly. Then, if I need more information, I switch to my normal browser, firefox."

When installed phone actually runs super slow and freezes up so bad that the only way to get it back on is to take the battery out then reboot😳. I've had others check it for me to ensure it wasn't caused by something I did as well! Not only all this but it even affects other apps in performance. Mind you I only install very few app at a time so my memory is not affected. So, I have to say that I would never recommend it.",

I'm unable to type a sentence without a pop-up telling me \"Carrier Hub is not responding. \" I went into app and forced it to stop. I don't know what's going on with Sprint and their company, but it SUCKS!! *10/30/20 - same issues. RIDICULOUS",
            "Just switched phones and got the oneplus8+ and this was already installed on it. I'm with T-Mobile and have been for years and now sprint is just messing it all up. This thing keeps having some MCM client process request notification pop up and training my battery. It's very annoying. After some research this thing is draining my battery and doesn't even do anything for my phone. In less then 2 hours I went from 81% to 48%. I just got the phone this afternoon. Very disappointed.",

I have fake Gmail, Google, Chrome, Bluetooth, operating system changed, my Boost, you name if there's an overly for that. If there's not you get error loading page till there is one. Been locked out of one of my Gmail accounts for 8 months but I can't contact Google because I can't get to the real site. Go look at the developers page and you will not believe what you see.",
            "This app was already installed on my phone when i bought it and i have had problems with the phone from the beginning. All it does is slow down my phone as well as freeze it up. I rarely have phone service and it is always checking my phone. So i finally unstalled it. Hopefully my phone will act right now."

Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",
            "Worst app ever. Way to take a step backwards. I want a refund for all my purchased songs through google play! I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

Now, if users want to circumvent such automatic saving, you added the options \"Add to another...\", \"Move from...\" and \"Remove from...\" --- problem with that is that these options COULD ALL BE TRIVIALIZED if the previous system was still in place.",
            "After using wikipedia app for about 2 years, I've been encountered some problem,first when you want to read the article that has been saved,sometimes it doesn't load at all,and tell me that i do not connected to the internet even though i already downloaded it,two when it successfully load the page there are some photos that's not loaded,so i don't really know the context of the description of the pictures",
            "Love this app, love wikipedia. Far better than searching Wikipedia articles in a browser on mobile. It's easy to use and the in-page seach function is particularly useful, as well as the quick introduction pieces you would normally only be able to access by hovering over a link on a PC or laptop. The quick edits are pretty good, if I'm bored I might steamroller through a couple of image captions or article descriptions. I also enjoy reading the main page in the morning.",

            "It's a good app. I like what Microsoft is going with it so far, with a productivity first approach. I would like to see some more customization options though, like App folder \"Covers\" in Action Launcher. You can have quick access to one app with a tap, while keeping the rest of the folders behind a swipe (or a long press). I like to keep a clean desktop, & that'd go a long way to cleaning clutter. I look forward to further updates & features.",
            "Just seems to make sense so far after all the others that just come close but ever just get there. I've tried every one of them. They just seem to leave one particular area unattended to. This one just seems to basically cover everything. I'm sticking with it until I see something better. It's a delicate balance between form and function. It cannot be just about one or the other alone. All the others looked cool and all but, they seemed to have been uncompleted somehow.",
            "I was bored of my system launcher after using it for 3 straight years. And eventually I came across Microsoft launcher and voila I loved it very much , it's very systematic and user friendly. There are few bugs and issues like \"Your feed\" doesn't load calendar events. But apart from that , it's the best launcher in the store.",
            "Absolutely love this!! I love how we can customise literally EVERYTHING been trying to look for something like this for so long and never would've thought Microsoft has a launcher and it is this good! I downloaded it initially so I can sync the clipboard for the stuff I copied and pasted Little did I know this launcher is actually this amazing My fav is that the \"subgrid\", \"your feed\" and that I can swip vertically for my home pages Anyways 5/5 for sure!!",
            "Absolutely brilliant. Clean simple and smooth. There is one thing I would like to see in a future update and that would be for an option to change the color of the gray overlay on left screen and the opacity. I personally would like to change this to a solid black to match my dark theme. Thank you for a wonderful launcher"

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",
            "Great game ever but it had a connection problem and more of bugs after this update please resolve it. And other thing is that we want to purchase diamonds there is no other way. And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

            "I have used on my computer forever! On the phone it won't download directly to my music player like other torrents do... so when I manually go and allow access for every single download.... it only selects a few to add to my phone.... you can listen on the app if you into that... or just go download a less known but somehow better \"flud\"..... bye bye ButtTorrent 👋 also lots of ads....",
            "I am seeing less full screen ads but what actually I hate is the fact that there is no notification to see if BitTorrent is downloading or not or how much download has completed. Also, if I am to get so much ads, I might as well go back to TorrDroid as the ads there are fewer and skippable.",
            "I am very disappointed of this app and the u torrent app, 'cause i wanted to download some movies and i found the apps of yours, and guess what?!?! It doesn't works, when i opened the apps i automatically closes and i reinstalled still doesn't work so i had to delete those apps. I did not found this app useful, i wanted to rate 0 stars, but i can't. When you fix this problem i will download this app!!!",
            "(Still not fixed, clear cache, Uninstall reinstall, power cycle, still cannot remove old torrents) It has an annoying glitch that does not remove torrents, ive contacted support, done all of their fixes and it seems to get worse, only started happening when the new features were introduced",
            "Started out great. Now every torrent I try to download pauses every few seconds and I havent changed any of the settings. Very frustrating as soon as my download reaches its maximum speed it pauses and starts over"

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

Disappointing really...",

At one time, they took more than 12 hours to respond only to have them de-register my number, & I've been removed from all my group chats. 2. While I was in a call in mobile & switch to a different screen, I can't go back to the call screen. I was on mute during the call. Had to text my responses to the call."

            "It's a good app, but need to be better. There is some problems with this app. My phonetic language is English but whenever I open it, it supports Bengali. It settings,it is showed that FB Lite's language is my phone's language. Another problem is it's network speed. It uses less data, this is good enough. But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",
            "My opinion about FB lite :- Mobile useres think that LITE is for only common smartphone and for those useres who have poor network. Now I am using Samsung Galaxy tripple camera phone. I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",
            "The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",
            "Good but still some bugs. Not possible to save any searches in Marketplace. Since update the search option in Marketplace doesn't work properly. When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

            "Incredible launcher!! I highly recommend! It gives your device such a smooth, organized feel. Plus, it looks simply beautiful. Also, there are an absolutely astounding number of customizable features included in the free version (which is basically ad-free as well). But since I knew I'd be sticking with this launcher for a long time to come, I forked out the one-time fee for the lifetime service, and now my customizable options are practically limitless! And I gotta say, it was worth every cent!",
            "I bought the Nova Launcher years ago and swore by it for a long time. Problem is, that launcher is stuck back in the times when I first bought it. Smart Launcher 5 is exactly what I needed to feel like I am using a modern launcher with modern features, look and animations. The free version gives you pretty much everything you need. I bought the pro version because it was 50% off, wanted to support the developers for a great product, and because there are a couple pro features that I'll use.",
            "Hands down, best launcher out there. There's even no competition. I've tried it all. Back in th days I had Nova pro and before this I had Poco. But this!! This is a whole new level!!! Downside is most of the good stuff are premium, but that's not even expensive for full time access, it's like 4 bucks or something, and it's money well spent. Keep up the good work! ❤️",
            "I am speechless at the amazing flexibility of this launcher. I know that I am going to pay for the lifetime pro at some point when I exhaust all functionalities! There is just one issue I'm having that I have not found a fix around: In the news page, for tech and gaming categories I get no news, instead there is a box \"index: 1, size: 1\". I would appreciate some advice on how to solve this.",
            "SL is awesome. I am using it for over 5 years now. It is (and was) the default launcher for me on every phone I have. I purchased premium only for ascetic reasons when ads were added to the free version. While updates are not abundant, it is apparent that the devs are considering feedbacks. The scrollable app page was a very much demanded feature. Finally it arrived and it is a breeze to use. It took some years, but I am very impressed. Now I have a powerful launcher with a lightweight UI."

            "This app is great. Lots of options. However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",
            "Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But \"watching\" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

            "Overall not a terrible app. has good films and shows on it. One thing that keeps on annoying me is that every time I open the app it reminds me about the profiles feature even tho I have already set up a profile on it. Also what's with the adverts, I am already paying £10 a month I don't want adverts. I get that you are promoting your new shows but put them at the end so when I exit the show give me a recommendation for a new show to watch. I know I can skip the adverts but it's just annoying.",
            "Generally first rate. The apps weak point is with no (or a weak) WiFi signal. Then when you go to play a previously downloaded show, you may get a license error. The license errors come in groups. Connecting to WiFi doesn't fix the problem. Deleting and re-dowloading the show will fix the problem. Sometimes it fixes a group of them.",
            "Almost great. No way to rate content. Unfortunately a lot of content is not available in original language. In Switzerland we have German, French and Italian as major languages so it is hit and miss if a film or show is in a language you speak even if it was originally made in English. Bohemian Rhapsody is only available in Italian, Electric Dreams only in German. Curiously Buffy the vampire slayer is only available in English. Netflix has original plus German, French and often Italian.",
            "The good things about prime video is it is a good deal for a lot of perks. The prime video library is really good too. Now the bad things The app is buggy at times. Sometimes when I close the player it returns to episode menu but is stuck there unless I go back to homepage The video player opens in seperate window and when I'm switching applications I can't tell which prime video window to select in recent apps window. The windows app is even worse, downloads expire as soon as I download them.",
            "It's an app deserving of 5 star rating all right. But this is an updated review because I am unable to stream in full HD on my LG G8x. I've checked the phone just to be sure and it supports Widevine L1 plus all other streaming services like Netflix are able to play HD content on my phone except this app. Please fix this. It's a frustrating experience and no one is even responding to my emails or feedback"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ☹️"

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

            "Use to be great but now when editing documents the words jump around to different areas miles from where you are typing. Last update didn't fix this issue and has created many more. Some documents have gone missing, tells me I need to upload already saved files when you try to open them, uploading creates two copies then if you save the newest when you reopen it asks if you want to open the new document and opens in the old file!!! Hours of work lost.",
            "It has very nice features and plus it gives; any benefits like creating forms of our choise... It can be of checkbox, multiple choice. Etc But there should be effects like darkning or lightning the presentation or any other thing to make without upgrading to the premium....... And also without buying. It should be free and there should be more creative templates.",
            "Used to be a good app until the last update now basic functions are just for the premium accounts and it's more bombarded with ads and that's just frustrating. Fix this or put me on the previous version. I still like the app, if you can fix these issues in the next update I'll be glad. Thanks🙂",
            "It's an mediocre app , it lets me view any pdf files that the in-built pdf app imln my mobile doesn't let me see. But, I'm willing to bet that there are many more good apps than this one, it doesn't even let you share pdf files without the premium version. In short : It's a good app for just viewing and editing pdf files, but I wouldn't suggest i for professional or daily use.",
            "Was good and bought 1 year Premium but all of a sudden they start to give me adds again. And its started to change some of my documents to different format like Chinese and diamond shapes. This app is now pretty useless. Spent 2 days rewriting my documents and 24 hours later they changed back to different format again. Extremely unhappy"

            "Loved this app until I got paid version. There are too few filers and it gets boring. None of the previous filters are in it, and I've seen many over the past couple of years. The fun section still only does side by side comparison instead of the whole picture. I'm not sure why it's so expensive with so few features. What it does do, it does very well. Impressions and presets are almost identical, make up too. A few pre-made looks could do the trick e.g \"Beach babe\" , \"barbie\", \"dictator\"",
            "I absolutely love this app. There is honestly no better app of its type. A massive problem though, is that I couldn't pay for the lifetime membership :( - the monthly plan works, but i wanted the lifetime plan... I'm new to Android, so if it's something that I need to fix, can you please inform me. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, and added many different payment methods (all with enough money in the accounts) my problems aside, even the free version of this app is worth 5 stars.",
            "This is the first time I'm saying, \" Today, 22-10-2020, I'm declaring that if there is a option to give 7 🌟, then I must give that. Seriously 😘. This AI app is the best of best! If I want to change the face or other tasks it will take an hour in Photoshop. Thanks for giving us Pro feature using Ad. Stay happy all the time, take care and stay safe at home 🏡.",
            "I absolutely love this app! There are still so many features available even without the paid version, and they actually all look real!! However, I am encountering one issue. For some reason, the \"My kids\" 1 and 2 are taking FOREVER to load. I know it's not an wifi problem because all the other ones load just fine and my wifi is really good. I will definitely change my review to a 5 star once this is fixed, thank you!",
            "This app is very good. I love the option on the app that allows you to see what your future children may look like. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because of minor errors such as having the girls look like 80 year old men or making the children look more like girls in the boy part instead of boys. I also suggest that this app would be really cool if an anime option was added. I've seen videos on this, and I think it would make the app more successful and up in rankings! Thanks!"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "The app is super great but there's just an improvement I would like to see. It's about the touch option on my Bluetooth earbuds, coz it has an option that touching it once either play or pause the video. The pause function is working but the play isn't. It's working on VLC but I kinda like using your app coz it's much easier when loading subtitles. I know it's really not an issue, hence rating it 5 stars coz I can just play it on my mobile but just wanted to let you know on something to improve.",
            "I have been using only MX player on my phone for years but the recent update has messed up its navigation system. Reasons: 1. A new feature has been added to seek the video by 10 secs by double click and now I'm so much used to using it for play/pause & there is absolutely no way to turn this feature off. 2. When you try to seek the video by swiping screen or even by using the forward/backward button, it doesn't move ths video according to the customized settings. I'm using it Note 9 btw",
            "Please Add Subtitles option for movies added in Mx Player. It will be good development in app to enhance user experience. Right now only online Subtitles available for playing movies from our folder. Already added Websereies and movies please enable the subtitles option. In case if I want to watch Tamil movies or kannada movies there are subtitles available. Please develop this option for MX Player.",
            "This app is awesome... I've been using this app for 2-3 years by now. The local video player is amazing and the customization is beyond amazing. But there's only one little simple problem though, that you haven't fixed yet. The brightness bar. Yeah the brightness bar you gave is 15 point bar instead of a 100. And the lowest point in the bar isnt even the dimmest brightness of the handset. Please do this one upgrade as soon as you can. And do the same for the volume bar too while youre at it plz",
            "This has been a really useful video player. I'm able to watch some of my favorite movies which I didn't get to by downloading or via Youtube. It also has a great feature of synchronisation to fix the videos which are not synced correctly. It also saves me the trouble of seeking subtitles of movies and TV shows from the browser. But I gotta say the ads are way too annoying. Whenever I open it or pause a video while the mobile data is on ads get in my way. Fix this so that I'll be glad to give 5 ⭐"

But cute cut is to complicated for me and many others. So, i tried kinemaster, yeah it works but it doesn't look that realistic. This doesn't have to mean hate to the company! Have a great day whoever is reading!",
            "I am a premium subscriber. I've used this app since November last year or so. It was amazing! It had everything I ever needed to make videos. But as soon as I became a premium suscriber, all the quality went down. Now, everything looks pixelated and fuzzy. It also sometimes lags and kicks me out nonstop. I'll go onto kinemaster and my screen freezes and eits me out saying 'Kinemaster isn't responding' I'll be waiting for this to be fixed. Right now I'm on a different app for videos.",
            "this app is exquisite! once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to edit with! an amazing thing about this is that it's on android and ios. But the downside of this app is whenever i export a video and put it on high quaility, the video actually looks like it has bad quaility! i also wish that a you could get rid of the watermark for free, but it's fine! overall, i think this app works amazing! totally reccommend!",
            "This app used to be awesome. Now it is so slow. Especially when you are checking through the music or sfx library. It takes times to load. Tsk tsk... not a value for my subscription anymore. Not gonna renew this anymore until I see a fix. Additonal review: I'm surprised that no one got back to me on this after the 1 star rating. Anyway, my annual sunscription is about to finish and already looking for a better one and I can see one worth trying though.",
            "I've been using Kinemaster for approx 2 months, makin videos for my gaming YouTube Channel. I do it all on my phone and the response has been just incredible. I can extract audio and overlay it enablin voice over clip commentary, I add effects, transitions and overlay not just pictures but also VIDEOS, yes, SCREENCAPTURES off my phone, crop such videos not just in length but also a specific area of the video I want to show, and all round every thing i could want to make memes and vids. 10/10!🔥"

The speeds are at an all time low for the past three months now, and the payment system is ridiculous. They already get lots of ad revenue from the app itself.",

Well I finally got this application to connect to WiFi. IDK what happened but it's working now. I hope it doesn't happen again. Because I'm not sure what I did to make it work. There was so many things that I did.",

Otherwise I am happy with Psiphon. Thanks to the developers."

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

            "Only one problem, 3 days ago, I could still search things, but whenever I tap to go on a website, it acts like its disconnected even if my tablet is connected to the Wi-Fi. It just freezes and does nothing so now I can't go on websites anymore! Can you tell me what the problem is so I can fix it? If you don't have the answer, I'll be bored forever without going to any websites! 😡😡😡 I hate this app sometimes because of this problem, but it only happened there.",
            "About 1 out of every 4 searches won't go through. They'll load for a second before the bar gets stuck at the end, and no search results populate the screen. Nothing is wrong with my phone or internet. Chrome app searches work 100% of the time. Google app is the issue, its been like this off and on for years, but recently has been acting up constantly.",
            "I am using a oneplus nord and whenever i search, this kept showing me ' check your internet connection' even when my connection is fast. Now, after the recent update, it is not even showing that, its just a blank white screen and nothing else. Sometimes it's working when i try again after reopening the app. Most of the time its not. Hope you'll fix this problem ASAP.",
            "So actually, i like google since years ago. But 3 days ago or 1 week ago, i can't translate. It's maybe not like i need to update it, beacuse it only said \"UNINSTALL OPEN\". So it's probablly confusing. I don't know why i can't translate. And also, There's a lot of bugs that i can't explain. Please fix these. Thank you! By the way, I apologize for my wrong grammars or bad english.",
            "I'm honestly going to switch to another app. Google has been ok with simple searches. However with the election coming up I've been trying to search up different facts and information on Biden and Trump, only to find rather biased results. I can even look up specific dates, name, and even addresses. The results are the same, many articles on things Trump has done wrong, or praise articles on Biden. It's not because of my search relevance either, I had all of that reset. Very disappointed."

You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each. I would've skipped the download button and tried remembering which other App is the REAL free one and doesn't use credits. Don't download, find other free one.",
            "I accidentally un install the apps, I tried to install again and log in my email address but I can't log in even if I click the forgot pass word. Please help me. This is my second time, before you don't take an action about my problem on this apps. All my credit I didn't use it. Waste of time.. grrrr. I will rate your apps if you fix my problem.",
            "I'm only giving 4stars easy to understand and set up, but I haven't tried calling with it, and have not received any calls yet, I'll be sure to edit the rating for you, 🤞,ok I have had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it, clear calling, easy to use and understand, I have shared with many friends and family, keep up the good work and THANK YOU 😉😉"

Though as of today 10/08/2020 I went to use it to work on some things and noticed it has mysteriously uninstalled itself. But guess what - I installed it RIGHT back lol😄.",
            "Try to make the UI simple instead of going here and there or copy the MI calculator app.Try to provide the calculation history in the entry field itself. So we can easily check the correctness of the calculation without going to the history window. Also while using scientific calculator I have to rotate the mobile. It is annoying and it is very difficult in field condition.",
            "Samsung this is a request to please make more user friendly ui of calculator app. To open the trigonometric and other functions, we need to rotate the mobile. Just a suggestion that it would be great if there can be a slide(swap from right to left) feature which can open those functions in portrait mode only. Thanks n regards",
            "It's a very good app, it calculate very accurately, it's very easy to use( just press the numbers like the real calculator and then press = to get your results) or tilt your phone to go to crazy super nerdy mode. Thank you Samsung for making calculations so easy.",

This is really frustrating and I've already tried numerous methods to fix it but nothing is working.",

More often then not pictures will not come through and in the rare case they do, they will only be displayed in thumbnail form and when clicked to expand will show previous pictures in the thread! Not the expected and typical performance ive come to know and love from google, you know the ones who developed android?😒",

The video will send to other OnePlus users but when I sent to other androids like samsung and iphones it don't send at all even if the video is 2 seconds long still will not send. Can you help me?",
            "MMS won't send pics, attach pics to messages never displays them in Gallery. Support tells me to reinstall the app as a fix. My question to support is why release an app in the first place that requires something like that for what's considered base functionality for a cell phone? You're taking away Hangouts which I used for txt before, so this is unacceptable to me as a solution.",
            "The app is the default SMS option on my phone. I've used it for years, and a bug since last winter has started deleting SMS history, which isn't recoverable. I lost years of conversations with people, and Google hasn't bothered to fix the app. This is beyond infuriating. The only restoration is to wipe my phone, use Pixel backup, still lose a week's of conversations, and then manually backup my SMS content each day. This is a well-reported issue, and Google doesn't offer a real solution."

Well, we save hundreds of messages every day, which are separate topics such as science sports and even lessons for students. If this content can be separated, it will be very good because it will take less time for us to find the content. Thanks to you.",

I see latest updates in channels and chats but after I close the app and open it again, it send me notifications for that seen messages again and again! And the other problem is that I get the notifications for new messages but they don't load in chats and channels!!! It's so annoying... Please fix it .",
            "No way to delete my info. Installed to find no way to make calls. Very unclear about why the selected only 3 contacts to sync out of my list. Was hoping to be able to make voip calls but this does not replace a conventional messenger and phone. No dial pad. No video calls like I was under the impression were here. Just really unsure what the point of the AP is all together. Like is this just for messeging strangers? I don't want that at all.",
            "i updated the app last night and since then it doesn't shows the last message in some channels and groups. you can see the last message from chat list but when you open the channel it's not there. and it skips some messages in channels or groups. it also doesn't show the source channel when i forward a message to my own channel.",
            "I would give it a 5 star rating. The animation are great and the fact that I have been told that I can send file/s up to 2gb in size is great (Not done so as yet) The problem ⚠️ I am having is I receive no notification sounds. Just vibration. I have looked up and down on how to change it, but no joy😐"

            "The overall system/hub is great. However, this app is slow and clunky. Classic was better. It takes some time to load everything on launch before I can do anything. Then, when you go into a device, there's only a tiny space on the sides to scroll. Otherwise, if you scroll in the middle fast, it won't scroll, gotta go slow and it looks like it wants to select an option. You simply cannot scroll past a color wheel for a light because you'll just be selecting a color instead of scrolling. Annoying.",
            "Could use a little work. Looks are better than the features. I wish for the oven connection, I didn't have to start while right in front of it and rather be able to at least start keep warm to get the oven started. Also that you have to stop oven to change which to a different setting then have to be once more right in front of oven to begin the new setting. I do understand it for security, but I think there should be a way to also disable temp for more secure homes.",

Not compatible with Android 11 can use my tracker anymore. Reached out to support and they told me an official version of Android is not supported... Reached out to support again and they said android 11 isn't supported because it's in beta. It hasn't been in beta for almost a month now and I can't use my smart Tracker.",

            "It's a great app so far but I have run into a slight issue with renaming songs. It seems like if you rename any songs you have downloaded with apps other than samsung music, it doesn't pick up on it. For example, if I have songnameA and I rename it to songnameB, it shows songnameB in the folder but in the app it doesn't change and is still songnameA. In the recently added section however, it shows songnameB, but as soon as I add it to a playlist it changes back to songnameA.",
            "This really is a good music app. It's simple, clean (mostly), user friendly, and not glitchy. I'd only change 2 things, but they bug me enough to drop rating 1 star each. #1 PLEASE add the option to list multiple, separate, Artists and Genres in 'edit Track Details'?! There is one line to list any & all, but if I add 2(+) names or a 'feat', the track won't show up under each artist, only the 2(+) names together. #2 NEED 'Do Not Show Again' box on irritating SiriusXM ad when app starts up.",
            "I have championed this app along with the very polished Internet and email apps Samsung makes. It is smooth, snappy, has good sound, is simple and light. But... Ads... They bothered me for a while, but I'm just learning to suck it up and deal with it. It's a couple of clicks every now and again. It's still the best in terms of functionality playing my local files. I like it's dark theme and generally feels intuitive. One star off because it would still be better without ads.",
            "As of the last three updates this app has been the bug central. The worst of any music apps I've used. The welcome ads; freezing before playing a song; long pauses before deleting a playlist or removing a song from a playlist. What gives? It was never like this before. I wish there was an option to reset it to factory settings. I'll be looking for a new app today.",
            "I had to move to this app because Google play shut down & YouTube music is garbage. It's alright. I can add music to some magical queue but somehow cannot look to see what's in said queue. It's good to make playlists & listen to music on random. However, unlike google play, when I put all my music on random I cant see a queue so I have no clue what's next, cant change my queue, and I dont like that. Unlike google play I cant swipe to the next song, I have to hit next, so in the car is not good."

It is impossible to even fathom the motivation behind that insane response, so I must assume it is a software glitch or a practical joke.",

Definitely my favorite photo editing app",

But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",

            "Great Office 365 alternative I have ever found. With other mobile wordprocessors that claim compatability, Word will only view and ask to save to edit. With OfficeSuite's Document app, this never happened, Word only went to editing. This was true for my personal desktop version too, went strait to editing with out any idication of issues. I am a Samsung DeX user and this also gives the best desktop experience. Just wish Aqua Mail was not seperate!",
            "I love the OfficeSuites! I was a hardcore user of Microsoft's Office for over 20 years. I started using OfficeSuites two years ago and I haven't looked back! I have used all the suites including Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word, and Mail. They all run smoothly and without issue every time. I would like to see the Mail suite get more options like the option to mark the email \"important\" or \"urgent\" for sending and the ability to change the fonts inside the columns and rows, but these are not deal breakers for me. I am so glad I found OfficeSuites!",
            "i just bought a new Samsung tablet, installed this believing it wouldn't have bugs associated with old ones, bought a year's subscription and it is full of glitches. It will not create new documents. It gives me a blank screen, no way to type a number or letter, i can type letters but they do not show or store. So i have to create documents from my Word program and import them in. It boots me out of my document often while i access a web page so not multi-tasking.",
            "Just a rip off. You can't open any existing documents unless you pay for a subscription. So you pay it then you find that it doesn't come with the usual, everyday fonts, such as Arial, Times New Roman etc. These are part of the \"Extended Font Pack\" apparently 😮. If you want to use any documents that have these fonts (and you probably will, these are the standard, boring, day to day fonts) you'll have to pay another £13.99 for the font pack to get your documents to open properly.

Like 4.99 and 10.99 or 35.99$ for some people that can be alot and that's just if you want TO SAVE the video YOU MADE. But there is some really cool templates. But I really wish I could of given this app a 5 star or at least a 4 star but no I had to give it a 3 stars. :(",
            "This app is great! It exports your videos very quickly, but I'm giving this a 4 star review because it doesn't really let you pick the music you want, it already gives you music with a type of style. Then again, this app is amazing and doesn't cost money to do the videos, so great job :)",
            "I just downloaded this app and it seems pretty cool and fun but it's already having some issues and it's only been five minutes. I picked out a few photos for a video and after pushing play the music in the video started skipping right away it only played part of it then kicked me out.",
            "This truly is a great app I realised that you don't exactly have to pay for everything even though there is a pro option it's perfectly fine because you don't have to pay for it and a lot of the templates are actually just for Free really good and you can remove the watermark too",
            "Extreamly beautiful app i have ever seen before for beat edting... But i suggest please add the favourite option in which users can add their favorite templates. And search option As well. Such an amazing Application. 😘😍 Thank you"

I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

Just add more items to the customize hub maybe add more tattoos and more hairstyles and an option to type your name on gloves😁and make the characters movements more realistic like dodging and the way they throw a punch.. Thank you developers for this great game🤩🤩🤩",

            "The old version is the best version of this app. This current model is a huge disappointment and it is consistent of being worst overtime. It focus more on nonsense stuff than the actual objective of this app. Plus, ads are so annoying. If it just stay on what it is designed to be back then, then it would be superb. Not recommended. 👎",
            "This app has been useful and I have been using it for 2 years, I think I have used it for too long that it doesn't work to some users anymore, it doesn't work anymore for me, my brother wanted for me to install Minecraft but he has so we instead tried to share it, it doesn't work, we tried it 12 times already, it kept saying \"receiver not found\" even we are on the same version of this app, it could have been a bug or other stuffs, but pls fix it!",
            "This app used to be great once upon a time. I've been using SHAREit since 2013, but it has just been getting worse over time. Now it's flooded with advertisements and unwanted stuffs. Even the main home page layout has been reduced drastically to make room for more advertisements. But the core feature of the app hasn’t improved at all. Extremely disappointed. Not recommended. There are much better alternatives available.",
            "When I first used this app it was so great and fast and I really love it. But now I higly recommend to stop using it because it has so many adds when you open the app, there are so many permisions requested unlike before and it has many unnecessary things added that should be not added. Every time they update, only the feature is upgraded and they forgot that the use of share it is to transfer fast and this is what the users expect, they should not put some unnecesary things.",
            "Now I really have to give it three stars. The ads are annoying me. The send and receive bottons are small. If I receive any app or game from another Mobile it doesn't install says base. And every time you give the same update. So can do something so it becomes popular like before. Please do something or I have to this app give it one star and install another app. I really love this sharing app. I am using it 2 years. But now I think this app has become an online video showing app. Thank you."

            "The good things about this keyboard is the privacy oriented approach, the pleasant colour scheme and that's about all the good I can say about it. The layout is fairly outlandish and sometimes frustrating if you aren't used to it and by far the worst thing about it is the autocorrect, which is awful. It rarely corrects words such as \"its\" to \"it's\", \"arent\" to \"aren't\". The autocorrect has no sense of suggesting commonly used words and it never correctly interprets acronyms like \"idk\".",
            "I love it in theory. but it's finicky. the Swype feature randomly turns off, I cant seem to find the options in the myriad of possibility its settings provide, took me fifteen minutes to get the extra language pack to show up... and if it doesn't know at all what word i mean it just doesn't write anything. and PLS don't require me to swipe all the way down to ' to write doesn't! I know its beta...but without the swiping input there's not enough there to change to it",
            "I've use it few times before testing it, my last test mostly covers all my needs. It becomes my main keyboard, the only thing is missing feature is the hybrid language dictionary , I would like to use two or three at the same time. Lighteight excellent support for old versions of android. I use it in all my devices , actually four, thanks for your excellent work",
            "Though it initially took some time to get it set up as I liked, I found this keyboard to be excellent. As a long-time user of SwiftKey I rarely ever find keyboard apps I like other than it but this one is very nice. The swipe and autocorrect has worked well for me. And I love that it asked for no sensitive permissions. One thing I would like to see is a little easier more functional use of emojis. Thank you to the developer for sharing. Grace and peace",
            "I’m loving this app with how it offers a T9-like key layout. However, I would like an option to quickly toggle text suggestions, and to base word suggestions on the key pressed and letters on that key, not the current character typed. This would speed up typing for me more akin to the T9 typing experience and improve my enjoyment of the app. Thanks for making it open source too! It would be great to have a floating keyboard too."

And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",

Even when I try to make payment through Mobile number. Then it's take lots of time select the number or searching the number with right name. Payment by mobile number it's take 3-4minutes. I have real experience and I can show you recording of screen while I make the transaction.",
            "Not upto the mark. Sincerely speaking - most times it fails without any valid reason. Got the response from the developer. However worth to mention here that, in other payment modes including BHIM UPI, such failures are rare. But in PhonePe it is frequent and recurring. Makes one annoying. Not reliable.",
            "There are more failed transactions in my PhonePe history then successful ones. What has happened to this app?? None of the services work, mobile recharge fails, credit card payment fails, electricity bill payments fail, even simple UPI transfer also fail. These things have been failing frequently. There are just way too many updates, but it doesn't improve the overall service of the app. POOR!!!",
            "After using many other payment apps, I found PhonePe app very convenient. The transactions happen without any glitch and very quickly. I just wish if they can reward their customers with more cashbacks and rewards to encourage them to use it more often for all the financial needs. Thanks for the wonderful service.",
            "Starting , this app gives cashback either on lower amount or higher amount but now a days , it wouldn't give a single cashback on transferring up to 5000 . It gives coupon which is useless like play Rummy coupon , so I give 1 star bcoz , Rummy is bad game which destoyed many people life . Give cashback instead of coupon , Laura lassan. Also give some good offers , you given offers are not useful"

            "The network of idea getting weaker and weaker day by day. I am using this network for the last 10 to 12 years. In the beginning idea was not so good, But after some time I personally felt that it was the bestest network provider. But after joining with Vodafone the range of their network went down day by day. At my work place, at my home, infact sometimes in the outdoor the network goes down. It suddenly goes to 0kb/s from 235 or 300 kb/s speed. Please idea I request you to increase the network.",
            "Idea sim is the worst , I have been using it from past 3 or 4 years but now it is really malfunctioning, the internet speed is too slow and also the network is very bad no matter wherever I go I can't use the internet properly, when I asked for help in the app it told me restart my phone but it didn't helped at all the network was the same, I had enough of this I am really going to port out.",
            "Data Speed is very low, unstable connectivity. Takes more time to upload requested pages, and Data speed is not constant. Some time going to be very low. Idea tower is just 300- 400 meters distance from my home and no barriers in between. Last day there was no network from morning to afternoon. Today on 20/10/2020 after noon till evening there was no network. And no internet connectivity. Suffered a lot. Verry bad service",
            "This app is really simple to use and eliminates the need to head out to get mobile recharge transactions done. It provides details about your plan, mobile data usage and all essentials However, the application keeps asking me to re-login everytime I open it again. As a customer, I have one sim card on my phone and having to login again (USING OTP) every time I close and open the app is really frustrating. Hopefully that is something that will be worked upon and improved.",
            "Upgraded to worst. Now there is no details of -Calls -Messages -Data usage and Balance deduction. When it was 'idea' we were able to monitor all our all call history & SMS history details. Now they upgrade to Vi and become the worst service network ever. No we are only able to do online recharge and can see the main balance. I don't think we need a app to know balance and to recharge where we have lot of apps with the same options."

            "Fantastic app! It could use a few more settings so users can tweak everything, and it would be nice to be able to pause the video-in-photo playing for a good screenshot. This is really a great app so far. *** One important problem I see with this app is that when you touch a spot on the screen to lock the focus, there is no way to make it autofocus again. :/ I got this app for the video-in-photo feature combined with the semi-manual focus feature, but the autofocus doesn't quite work right.",
            "WOW .. just WOW !! After years of being frustrated with my Android device cameras, it's popped up in my play pass and I thought well let me give it a try. By FAR the clearest images & filters that you have just right as you're taking the picture without losing your shot. No more twisting and turning and getting cramps in my hands. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ★",
            "I like that it opens up instantly soon as clicked. No annoying whatevers to have to wait for. I will say its better than my fone camera. I have a galaxy flip 2. And I'm very disappointed with this camera. Was expecting better but probably would be better on a fine with better camera. Would like to see more filters, maybe add some fun Snapchat type effects but good job guys..",
            "I am happy with my device camera which is far better than this application with slow motion, time lapse, boomrange, short videos,image and video effects, low light sensor, sony imx sensor, phanaroma, HDR, timer, beauty mode, tilt shift, manual, image stablization, bokeh mode, potrait mode and many more settings available in my device camera i dont think this app has something special to keep this.",
            "It's okay. Trying my Powerdirector app for video editing and it will not accept any files that I use from this app. That was a deal breaker. I had to take each video file and convert it to the proper codec. There is no option in these settings to do that before transferring to a editor. Way too much time consuming just to get a decent video clip for editing. Not worth the time or effort."

I loved the cool themes given as well as the customization feature.Whatsapp status saver is additional but usefull.Only thing I would like to request you that please give the properties option in the video while playing as that present in mx player. Another issue I have found that the HEVC format is not playing well, its lagging and buffering So I request you to please fix it soon.",
            "Best of the best music app. Love it. Keep up the good work. Try to check the Mp4 settings because sometimes mp4 video does not play on PC when downloaded using Vidmate. It's need Playit on PC, but after downloading the playit software on the computer /laptop, still the video is not playing, the same message appears. Before everything was superb, the downloaded Mp4 video were playing without any problem but since the announcement of Playit everything becomes complicated. Hope to hear any advice",
            "You know what this app is amazing. Cool features *Supports extensive formats of audio and videos. *Has an AI inbuilt subtitle translator. *Video to audio player *Good Equalizer for music. *Best possible UI. *Online subtitles. The only feature Iam not able to use is Video downloader.But it is not a problem as long as I am using vidmate for that purpose. Developers have been working very hard to improvise this in all views. And this is \"MADE IN INDIA\"",
            "This video play is pretty good this is the best video player I've ever used. I love the fact that it can manage to play just about any video format.. And it pretty much resumes at the exact timing were you left off in a video you were previously watching, if you select that option that it presents to you..",
            "I like this app, i gave you 3 stars because of only one thing that is disturbing me up to now about the PLAY IT apk...why this app can't share from one mobile phone to another i.e it doesn't appear on \"xender\" share...but why? I hope you will fix it"

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

Manually typing in the words doesn't lead to the red line which means the words are still being recognized. The personal dictionary has all the words as well when you check in settings. I ended up deleting the update and that helped some the problem. Other than that, it's great!",
            "It doesn't work and caused me a lot of problems.i can't type on instagram or send comments.its really annoying.since it has stopped working properly I face too many problems .keeps asking me to send report but useless absolutely crop. please fix the problem.",
            "I don't usually write feedback on basic apps in phone, but your keyboard gives me headaches everytime I try to type anywhere really. Facebook, messenger, whatsp, mails. :/ what helped bit is to do factory settings. Anyway clearing out personal dictionary one by one is also great fun. Few thousand words no problema, a few hours of joy. I'm on old desire 530 and not planning upgrade to HTC due to these problems. Plus crushes & errors, recently serious restart error. Better get a backup.",
            "Meh, it's alright, it has cool Emojis and stuff but the autocorrect is dreadful. Whenever I type anything the chances of it replacing the word to something else is 99%.",
            "Hey,   I just bought htc Desire 10 Pro. My issue is I want to use regional language like Gujarati and Hindi with my new phone. Phone came with TouchPal Keyboard... and not with htc sense input. So I download it fromgoogle paly store. Now my problem is this version of htc sense doesn't support Gujarati or Hindi keyboard...! Is there any solution...? Thanks"
