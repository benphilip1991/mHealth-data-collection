            "Here's *SOME* Help, Everyone (please read all the way through): OK, I'm a team captain. My app worked fine for two days then I couldn't hit the start button. My calendar was gone, my past walks were missing on the screen, etc. The help center said they couldn't replicate it on their end, so I don't think helps coming. Here's what I did (WARNING: I'm not a professional). 1. Make another account. Join your team. Keep the same name or not, whatever. You need to use a different e-mail, though. 2. Link Google Fit (I used the same Google account, it allowed me access into my team captain page later, but then none of my walks as team captain counted. Soooo, maybe use another gmail account? I cannot say whether or not that will work, because I used the same). 3. Walk and get a few steps in. 4. Log back into your original account. 5. It *should* work to at least let you change goals, and walk HOWEVER, it didn't record my steps bc I used the same Google account. I cannot say whether using a different account will have different results, but at least I can edit things now as team captain and do my steps on my new account.. I've tried for 6 days to uninstall/reinstall, clear data cache, re-link Google Fit, redo Google Fit, etc. and nothing ever changes, because something is fundamentally wrong with the account. I CAN log into my team mates accounts PERFECTLY and everything works, but mine was dead in the water. That's why I created a new account. I figured I'd let my team captain account go dead and just use the new account, but when I logged into the team captain one, it worked....it just wasn't recording my steps (I can hit the start button and everything, it just isn't posting?). Good luck, and thanks for supporting Alzheimer's research, everyone <3",
            "Would not track steps. I pressed the start button nothing happened. My husband's app worked perfectly. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. It finally started working so I went on a second walk. It had a glitch mid walk and after 2 walks I show 0 steps. My friend had a similar issue but I guess on the ios version you can manually add steps. I have been unable to figure out how to manually add steps on this version.",
            "Not able to track steps or add manually. Not synching from Google Fit either. My walk is this Saturday and I would like this to work so I can participate.",
            "Start button for tracking walk does not work, so all this app is good for is donations.",

        "description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years. \r\nThe cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genesusually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesitymay decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is not strong. There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease risk. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Alzheimer symptoms, Alzheimer management, Alzheimer causes, Alzheimer diagnosis, Alzheimer Prognosis, Alzheimer Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Alzheimer Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Additionally, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is based on tests your doctor administers to assess memory and thinking skills.\r\n\r\nLaboratory and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes or help the doctor better characterize the disease causing dementia symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe entire set of diagnostic tools is designed to detect dementia and determine with relatively high accuracy whether Alzheimer's disease or another condition is the cause. Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed with complete certainty after death, when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the characteristic plaques and tangles.\r\n\r\nTests\r\nA diagnostic work-up would likely include the following tests:\r\n\r\nPhysical and neurological exam\r\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam and likely assess overall neurological health by testing the following:\r\n\r\nReflexes\r\nMuscle tone and strength\r\nAbility to get up from a chair and walk across the room\r\nSense of sight and hearing\r\nCoordination\r\nBalance\r\nLab tests\r\nBlood tests may help your doctor rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin deficiencies.\r\n\r\nMental status and neuropsychological testing\r\nYour doctor may conduct a brief mental status test or a more extensive set of tests to assess memory and other thinking skills. Longer forms of neuropsychological testing may provide additional details about mental function compared with people of a similar age and education level. These tests are also important for establishing a starting point to track the progression of symptoms in the future.\r\nTreatment\r\nDrugs\r\nCurrent Alzheimer's medications can help for a time with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Two types of drugs are currently used to treat cognitive symptoms:\r\n\r\nCholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication by preserving a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. The improvement is modest.\r\n\r\nCholinesterase inhibitors may also improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation or depression. Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon).\r\n\r\nThe main side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances. In people with cardiac conduction disorders, serious side effects may include cardiac arrhythmia.\r\n\r\nMemantine (Namenda). This drug works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.\r\nSometimes other medications such as antidepressants may be prescribed to help control the behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.\r\nCreating a safe and supportive environment\r\nAdapting the living situation to the needs of a person with Alzheimer's disease is an important part of any treatment plan. For someone with Alzheimer's, establishing and strengthening routine habits and minimizing memory-demanding tasks can make life much easier.\r\n\r\nYou can take these steps to support a person's sense of well-being and continued ability to function:\r\n\r\nAlways keep keys, wallets, mobile phones and other valuables in the same place at home, so they don't become lost.\r\nKeep medications in a secure location. Use a daily checklist to keep track of dosages.\r\nArrange for finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit.\r\nCarry a mobile phone with location capability so that a caregiver can track its location. Program important phone numbers into the phone.\r\nMake sure regular appointments are on the same day at the same time as much as possible.",

        "description": "AlzLife delivers a combination of 40Hz light therapy, 40Hz sound therapy, and cognitive exercises in a single, easy-to-use, convenient package.\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS:\r\n\r\n• Use 40Hz light therapy alone or combine with 40Hz sound and brain games\r\n• You favorite cognitive games designed for people with low computer skills: Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe, Clocks, from very easy to challenging\r\n• A personalized Life Coach that includes Guided Meditations, Exercises, Daily Planner, and more\r\n\r\nNew research suggests that light and sound delivered at a certain frequency —40 flashes or clicks per second — appear to restart the natural 40Hz gamma rhythm of the brain, improve the brain functions and diminish toxic levels of Alzheimer’s-related proteins.\r\n\r\nSeparately, research has also shown that cognitive exercises could have a major effect on improving memory. The synergistic combination of light, sound and cognitive therapy utilized in AlzLife has the potential to improve the brain’s function better than either of these therapies alone.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS:\r\n\r\nAlzLife delivers a combination of 40Hz light therapy, 40Hz sound therapy, cognitive exercises, and a personalized Life Coach in a single, easy-to-use, convenient package.\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE BEHIND THE PROJECT:\r\n\r\nThe most recent research about light therapy for Alzheimer’s disease appeared in the journal Cell in 2019, entitled “Multi-sensory Gamma Stimulation Ameliorates Alzheimer’s-Associated Pathology and Improves Cognition.” Researchers from MIT found that when mice engineered to exhibit Alzheimer’s-like qualities were exposed to flickering lights and 40Hz sounds for one hour a day, their brain functions improved and toxic levels of Alzheimer’s-related proteins diminished. In addition, the 40Hz sound appeared to improve cognitive and memory skills.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE ALZLIFE:\r\n\r\nWe recommend using your AlzLife app for one hour a day. The MIT research shows significant improvement after only one hour of light and sound exposure. If the 40Hz gamma frequency flicker is too bothersome, start using the app with the light therapy settings set to a minimum. Most people will get used to the flicker over several sessions. If you stop noticing the flicker, you may want to increase the intensity within the app’s Light Setting. The best recommendation for any therapy is to use it in moderation and make adjustments based on how you feel. \r\n\r\nThe game portion of the therapy was specifically designed for memory and cognitive improvement. Start the cognitive therapy with games you are familiar with, then continue with as many games as possible. We recommend starting at an easy level and slowly increasing the game difficulty to a level that is challenging but not uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBLE DEVICES:\r\n\r\nThe light therapy function of AlzLife requires the refresh rate of your device’s screen to be 120Hz or 80Hz. Only on these devices AlzLife will generate 40Hz light stimulation. Note that on some devices, you need to manually increase the screen refresh rate in Android Settings.\r\n\r\nDevices with the refresh rate of 60Hz can generate the maximum of 30Hz light stimulation (30Hz flickering is slower than 40Hz flickering). Light frequencies other than 40Hz have not been shown to produce the same therapeutic effect.",

However, the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors in treating the broad spectrum of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease are not sustained indefinitely, and the illness continues to progress even while patients are receiving treatment. Additionally, while temporary stabilization may occur, there is typically only a modest improvement from baseline, and side effects from treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors can be too severe for some patients to tolerate.

            "I like the exercises this app has to offer, but my concern is with the icon that sounds like it is talking to a very little kid. My husband is already feeling like a baby with everything else that goes with his stroke from surgery for a glioblastoma. He has a very long term recovery ahead, and this app looks like it would help, but I also have to consider his feelings.",
            "For a recovery app that is intended for adults that have had a stroke or other brain injury it is very juvenile. same set up as the kids games. Make it friendly for all age groups. The encouraging voice is to childish and the whoka word it says is very annoying. Please make this so it is geared for adults. Thank you.",
            "The exercises are great and I quite like the progress and pace of them. I use this app with my cousin with Autism, and while it requires us to tutor him at times, he quite likes the app and finds I easy it use. Most aphasia apps ive found require quite a bit of money in order to unlock other content (content thats not that great too) so i appreciate how much you offer without the premium charge.",
            "Just downloaded this for my Autistic son for the cognitive therapy aspect. He is almost 8 years old. It was a huge hit and very educational for him. He is very hard to keep focused, but with this app he just wanted to keep going! That is why I am giving it 5 stars!"

Las actividades fomentan muchas áreas cognitivas distintas: Hay ejercicios de lenguaje, operaciones matemáticas simples, adivinanzas y refranes, dibujar, identificar imágenes, escribir un diario y hasta hacer su propio árbol genealógico.

I was very surprised just a couple of days after setting up the diary to hear her saying how wonderful it is. She's now also using a second one in another room and is so grateful for the reminders that I put on her calendar. Thank you so much for creating this and for making it available for free."

It is a stable 30hz flickering light. If your phone has a 120hz display then 40 hz flickering can be achieved. Please check the description for a link to our 120hz prototype.",

            "Tap \"Light Mode,\" and the display blinks at 40 Hz while it also provides binaural tones. It has a pink nose generator for while you sleep, which it says is good for Alzheimer's. I don't know why the blinking display is limited to only a dozen small white dots -- why not turn the whole display white-and-blinking, and why not offer the camera flash? Those would make it easier to share the Light with a friend. Instead of binaural freqs, i would rather Bluetooth 40 Hz to my stereo.",
            "I really liked the concept of this app and the fit with recent research on 40 hz light and sound potentially impacting abeta and tau. After reading app info...it's made clear by developer that the lights are 30 hz due to 60 hz limit of phone screens. Don't understand why this is limitation...but accept it."

        "description": "One of the most common mental problems affecting seniors is Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, taking precautions against memory loss becomes vitally important. Although a certain decline in memory is a normal part of aging, the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, social interaction, and the taking of certain foods can greatly diminish memory loss. Alzheimer's condition progressively impairs memory, and can eventually render seniors incapable of taking care of themselves.\r\n\r\nEstimates indicate that around 4.5 million Americans currently have the disease. Alzheimer's disease usually develops after the age of 65, but a genetically-inherited type of the disease can affect people as young as 30. There are many risk factors. These can include oxidative stress, head trauma, estrogen loss after menopause, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Alzheimer's\r\nAlzheimer's presents many different symptoms. They include:\r\n\r\nForgetting information that has been recently learned.\r\nExperiencing difficulty performing tasks that are familiar, such as using the phone or crossing the street.\r\nLanguage impairment, such as forgetting simple words.\r\nTime and place disorientation, such as forgetting the way home.\r\nExperiencing problems with abstract thinking, like basic arithmetic.\r\nExhibiting poor or decreased judgment, like wearing a summer dress in winter.\r\nFrequently misplacing things and/or placing objects in peculiar locations, such putting a pillow in the bathtub.\r\nShowing mood and behavior changes that can manifest in drastic mood swings.\r\nPersonality changes exhibiting different traits such as confusion, dependency, or suspicion.\r\nA clear loss of initiative and passivity, such as spending all day watching television or sleeping for long periods.\r\nA person afflicted with Alzheimer's may also experience loss of body mass. In fact, there's clinical evidence that loss of BMI in seniors underscores the development of Alzheimer's.\r\n\r\nPeople, however, differ in the various combinations of the symptoms and their development. Research shows that at its initial stage, there are no apparent Alzheimer's symptoms. It's only at the second stage that a mild cognitive decline can be detected. There are also other conditions, such as depression, vitamin deficiencies, and excessive alcohol consumption that can lead to memory impairment. Therefore, one must first rule out other issues and conditions.\r\n\r\nAlzheimer's Prevention\r\nAs a chronic condition, the role of an adequate diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle is crucial for preventing or slowing down Alzheimer's damaging effects. Here are a few useful tips for a healthy brain and body:\r\n\r\nExercise. Physical activities, such as walking, are linked with improving one's ability to learn, countering any negative changes in brain chemistry.\r\nPartake in mentally stimulating activities. Reading, vocabulary games and puzzles, are some of the activities that can increase the number of nerve-fiber connections in the brain. These connections can offset changes associated with Alzheimer's. There is also evidence to suggest that more education decreases the risk of developing the disease.\r\nEngage in healthy relations with others. Social support networks can protect against the development of emotional and cognitive conditions.\r\nDo not smoke. Those who smoke in their older years are more prone to Alzheimer's.\r\nConsume foods rich in vitamin E.

            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

            "I really, really enjoy the app... But I bought the subscription for a year, and it never loaded. The exact dollar amount was taken off my debt card. I'm giving it 4 stars, when normally I would 1 star an app for taking my money. However, their customer support is outstanding!! 🤗 💕",
            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

I also noticed at least one spelling mistake within the app, even while only reading through the very first section, about Accute Stress Disorder (ASD).",

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

Luckily, many of the things we do to keep our bodies healthy on a day-to-day basis also have fantastic benefits for our brains. In fact, according to the Alzheimer's Society, there is evidence to suggest that a healthy lifestyle may reduce your risk of developing dementia.\r\n\r\nAs well as keeping our bodies in optimum health, a healthy, balanced diet also benefits the brain. \r\n\r\nResearch in to diet and its effect on your brain is still in its infancy, but many advocate the benefits of a Mediterranean diet. The diet includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, healthy fats (think oily fish, nuts, seeds, etc) and low amounts of red meat, processed foods and sugar. What's more, the Mediterranean diet is all about taking time over your food and being social – two other healthy approaches when it comes to eating.\r\n\r\nThe single most important factor in determining your health is the quality of the decisions that you make every day. You can take the time to start the necessary steps to improve your health today by beginning with the following:\r\n\r\n• Know about the health of your brain – get a base line brain health assessment.\r\n• Know your health numbers – you need to optimize your important health numbers, not just normalize them.\r\n• Avoid anything that hurts your brain and may cause brain injuries – engage in regular brain healthy habits.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Alzheimer’s disease starts decades before you have any symptoms and untreated Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and addictions all increase your risk for it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important ways to decrease your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is to decrease all of the risk factors for it.\r\n\r\nEven if you are healthy it will still be good to consider avoiding foods that will hurt your brain.

All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved.

        "description": "A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. When a gallstone blocks the bile duct, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic (gallbladder attack) can result. This happens in 1–4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), jaundice, and infection of a bile duct (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. \r\nRisk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected on blood tests. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Gallstone symptoms, Gallstone Management & Gallstone causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Gallstone Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Sore throat, also known as throat pain, is pain or irritation of the throat. It is usually caused by pharyngitis (inflammation of the throat) or tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils). It can also result from trauma. About 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. \r\nA sore throat is usually from irritation or inflammation.

        "description": "Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence. Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.

        "description": "A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. \r\nBurns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Burns symptoms, Burns Treatment, Burns causes, Burns diagnosis, Burns Prognosis, Burns Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Burns Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "title": "Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder Navigator",
        "description": "Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder Navigator app focusses on personalization to remind Dementia and Alzheimer's patients that they are surrounded by loved ones every time they see the clock. The following are the 3 functions: clock, reminder, navigator.\r\n\r\nScreen -1: Personalized Dementia Clock -  Shows time, day, time of day. Dementia clock has a black background with white letters. Dementia clock can be personalized by adding patient's name and those who live with them. Reminding the names of the loved ones and relationship passively and constantly through the clock can help Dementia patients remembering family members. Dementia clock calls out their name in every screen along with their caregivers name. For example, “Hello Dad, This is Megan. It is Sunday Morning 10:08 AM” rather than simply showing clock.\r\n\r\nScreen 2: Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder: All of the Personalized Dementia clock plus reminders for a one-a-day event, a thrice a day event, and a one time event.\r\n\r\nThrice a day reminders: For example, seniors need to take medicine 3 times a day -  everyday. Once the times are entered, Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder shows a winding down timer for to show how much time is left for the next meal or medicine. The count down timer is unique as the patient doesn’t have to subtract the current time from the activity time. Knowing exactly how many hours left can reduce anxiety. Once the event arrives, it switches to the next event.This can also be personalized by a message.\r\n\r\nOnce a day reminder: Walking or exercise, a favorite TV program, or the caregiver going to pick up groceries or their son/daughter from school. Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder again shows a countdown timer showing time left for the event (as opposed to the time of the event). If the care givers goes to pick up their kid routinely, personalized message is “Hi Mom, I’ll pick up my son and be back in xx:yy hrs”. This is every day event - once set, it repeats every 24 hours.  When the event time comes, It automatically switches to the time left for the same event next day. Such personalized Dementia clock message passively reminds them of their kids and grandkids too.\r\n\r\nOne time event reminder: Future visits from kids (or Grandkids), appointment with a doctor, number of days to Christmas etc. This winding down clock shows number of days left for the event. It needs to be set every time as it is a one time event. \r\n\r\nAll screens can be personalized.

        "descriptionHTML": "Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder Navigator app focusses on personalization to remind Dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s patients that they are surrounded by loved ones every time they see the clock. The following are the 3 functions: clock, reminder, navigator.<br><br>Screen -1: Personalized Dementia Clock -  Shows time, day, time of day. Dementia clock has a black background with white letters. Dementia clock can be personalized by adding patient&#39;s name and those who live with them. Reminding the names of the loved ones and relationship passively and constantly through the clock can help Dementia patients remembering family members. Dementia clock calls out their name in every screen along with their caregivers name. For example, “Hello Dad, This is Megan. It is Sunday Morning 10:08 AM” rather than simply showing clock.<br><br>Screen 2: Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder: All of the Personalized Dementia clock plus reminders for a one-a-day event, a thrice a day event, and a one time event.<br><br>Thrice a day reminders: For example, seniors need to take medicine 3 times a day -  everyday. Once the times are entered, Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder shows a winding down timer for to show how much time is left for the next meal or medicine. The count down timer is unique as the patient doesn’t have to subtract the current time from the activity time. Knowing exactly how many hours left can reduce anxiety. Once the event arrives, it switches to the next event.This can also be personalized by a message.<br><br>Once a day reminder: Walking or exercise, a favorite TV program, or the caregiver going to pick up groceries or their son/daughter from school. Dementia Clock Personalized Reminder again shows a countdown timer showing time left for the event (as opposed to the time of the event). If the care givers goes to pick up their kid routinely, personalized message is “Hi Mom, I’ll pick up my son and be back in xx:yy hrs”. This is every day event - once set, it repeats every 24 hours.  When the event time comes, It automatically switches to the time left for the same event next day. Such personalized Dementia clock message passively reminds them of their kids and grandkids too.<br><br>One time event reminder: Future visits from kids (or Grandkids), appointment with a doctor, number of days to Christmas etc. This winding down clock shows number of days left for the event. It needs to be set every time as it is a one time event. <br><br>All screens can be personalized.

        "description": "Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise. \r\nAsthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivityreaction. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Asthma symptoms, Asthma management, Asthma causes, Asthma diagnosis, Asthma Prognosis, Asthma Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Asthma Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Altitude sickness, the mildest form being acute mountain sickness (AMS), is the negative health effect of high altitude, caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation. Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, feeling tired, trouble sleeping, and dizziness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion. Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude. \r\nAltitude sickness typically only occurs above 2,500 metres (8,000 ft), though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities. \r\nPrevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres (1,000 ft) per day. Being physical fit does not decrease the risk. Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids. Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen, acetazolamide, or dexamethasone. Severe cases may benefit from oxygen therapy and a portable hyperbaric bag may be used if descent is not possible. Treatment efforts, however, have not been well studied. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Altitude Sickness symptoms, Altitude Sickness management, Altitude Sickness causes, Altitude Sickness diagnosis, Altitude Sickness Prognosis, Altitude Sickness Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Altitude Sickness apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"consumption\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. \r\nTuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.

        "title": "MIND Diet",
        "description": "The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or more commonly, the MIND diet, combines the portions of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet. Both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve cognition; however, neither were developed to slow neurodegeneration (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). Therefore, a team at Rush University Medical Center, headed by Martha Clare Morris (a nutritional epidemiologist), worked to create the MIND diet. Like the DASH and Mediterranean diets, the MIND diet emphasizes the intake of fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes. The MIND diet also includes recommendations for specific foods, like leafy greens and berries, that have been scientifically shown to slow cognitive decline. Recent research has shown that the MIND diet is more effective at reducing cognitive decline than either the Mediterranean or DASH diets alone. Additional testing has shown that the level of adherence to the MIND diet also impacts the diet's neuro-protective effects.\r\n\r\nThe MIND diet is fairly new; the first article describing the diet and its efficacy was published in 2015. This initial study sampled from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Memory and Aging Project and followed 960 participants over the age of 50 across a time span of five years. Changes in cognitive ability were correlated with specific nutritional components of the MIND diet. The inclusion of higher numbers of MIND diet recommended foods in one’s daily diet was associated with less cognitive decline than when these foods were not included or were included in lesser quantities. A follow-up study compared the effectiveness of the MIND diet to that of the Mediterranean and DASH diets within the same study population. The study showed that all the diets can be protective against the development of Alzheimer’s disease when they are strictly followed. The MIND diet also was effective at moderate adherence levels. The study also found that the MIND diet adherence was more accurate at predicting cognitive decline than either Mediterranean or DASH diet adherence. Although the MIND diet shows promising results, the findings must be replicated in other population based studies to confirm these conclusions. A drawback of the two studies discussed here is that cause and effect relationships could not be determined. A controlled, diet intervention study would be necessary to determine cause and effect.\r\n\r\nWhen designing diets for the prevention of certain diseases, it is necessary to know the impacts of individual nutrients on the human body. The MIND diet could be improved by future research which investigates the impacts of individual nutrients or foods on neuronal physiology and anatomy. It is also beneficial to use dietary measurements that are culturally appropriate to enable researchers, dietitians, and the general public to draw accurate conclusions from the data.\r\n\r\nMore Feature;\r\n# What is the MIND diet\r\n# Foods to eat\r\n# Foods to avoid\r\n# How MIND diet work\r\n# May reduce harmful Beta - Amyloid proteins\r\n# Research on the MIND diet\r\n# Best foods to boost your brain and memory\r\n# Home message\r\n# Weekly a sample meal plan\r\n# MIND diet goal tracker\r\n# BMI calculator\r\n# Calorie calculator\r\n# Take notes\r\n# Apps info\r\n\r\nFeedback:-\r\nIf you have any suggested features or improvement, please leave a comment.

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

But it is very helpfull if the developer adds few animations in the workout session instead of just words or comments . And they must have try to add some more intrusting brain games like word games and some Video games that force to Multitask.",

The app helps make it easier for families to care for a loved one – no matter where they are.\r\n\r\nThe app helps a family detect if a loved one is struggling.

        "description": "Alois is designed to help, entertain, and assist early-stage Alzheimer’s disease patients through a variety of settings. The user-friendly interface, designed for Alzheimer’s patients, has three primary functional tabs which are capable of a variety of tasks. \r\n\r\nThe first tab is an emergency and warning tab. At the top of the tab layout, users can find a table with the 5 FDA Approved Alzheimer’s medications (Aricept, Razadyne, Namenda, Exelon, Namzaric) and their most common side effects. Additionally, it contains the phone number for the police, along with the phone number for poison control. This tab also allows the user to pick an emergency contact from their phone contacts, such as a family member or personal doctor, for quick and easy reference. These functions help to consolidate important emergency information for Alzheimer’s patients into one place so that it is easy to find and not complicated.\r\n\r\nThe second tab of our app contains a game that helps users to improve their memory and coordination. The game consists of a 3x4 grid of square buttons that toggle between three colors (red, green, and grey) when pressed. It includes in-game instructions and features a “new task” button which prompts users with simple tasks to complete, and changes the task when the patient presses the button. It also includes instructions at the bottom for first-time users and as a helpful reminder. This game is a way to strengthen the memory and puzzle-solving skills of Alzheimer’s patients using our app.\r\n\r\nThe final tab of our app contains an interactive reminder space. This tab allows users to set personal alarms with customized names and text content, enabling users to remember important information and create scheduled to-do lists easily. These reminders can also be edited at any time by the user if they wish to change or cancel an alarm. This function ensures that patients can remember key timings, such as those when they have to take their medicine. \r\n\r\nAlois is not liable for any damage or risk caused in emergency situations, specifically with the warnings tab of our application. Alois' services are not life-saving devices and are not replacements for calling emergency services. In case of an emergency, you should always contact your local emergency services right away, if you are able.",

The file list should scroll as files are copied/moved so you can see where you are in the process. 2. Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless. I will now have to do the entire thing again using a different utility. The app is useless until this is corrected.",

Awful experience, I'll be seeking a refund 👎👎👎",

I have to: grant the SD card (which is SanDisk card) access to the SanDisk Memory Zone app in order to complete the operation. The directions that come with the app are incomplete at best. So far using this app has been a waste of time. I can't transfer anything at this point. I've tried contacting you once before & I'm still waiting for an answer or acknowledgment. The SD card I have on my phone now is the SanDisk Ultra Plus microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter 64GB. The small card is the one I can use on my phone.",

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.\r\nRubella is usually spread through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year. Only humans are infected. Insects do not spread the disease. Once recovered, people are immune to future infections. Testing is available that can verify immunity. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood, throat, or urine.

Gave it 2 stars because I like the idea of the app, but the heart rate was consistently 10-20 bpm above my Garmin heart rate monitor (which is trusted) and the actual pulse in my wrist - way off. The app consistently told me I have an arrhythmia, but said the same for everyone who tried it - including my red sofa cushion which is apparently also bradycardic lol. I'm sure I was on the camera lens well, and remained very still. If you download this app, don't take it too seriously.",

Research proves that catching the symptoms early and intervening with lifestyle modification can delay the repercussions. However, there is a lot of hesitation in consulting a Psychiatrist. This app enables the user to screen themselves in the privacy of a home. The app can enable detect the symptoms early and this can then be followed up with a consultation with a specialist, either in person or through a video call.\r\n\r\nThe app will also enable care providers to keep in touch with the Dementia expert they have consulted through video calls and quick chats. \r\n\r\nLater iterations of the app will enable caregivers to track the care plan developed by the Dementia specialist. This is essential both for the care provider and for the caregiver as it will ensure continuity of care. The person with Dementia can also be engaged at home using brain activities and games built into the app. \r\n\r\nCaregivers can connect with each other to create a strong caring community. This can be useful when it comes to lobbying with lawmakers for reforms and laws. It can also help in tackling crisis situations and comparing notes on products which can help enhance care. \r\n\r\nThe app can also assist in finding service providers who can provide quality care for loved ones.\r\n\r\nDementia: Dementia is the progressive decline of mental faculties like memory, learning, orientation, language, comprehension, and judgment. The decline is very gradual, debilitating and depressing. In the early stages, the afflicted person undergoes memory loss and is unable to recall familiar names and places or everyday objects. Sometimes the person also undergoes personality changes. As the condition progresses, the person gets increasingly dependant on others for even simple tasks like eating, bathing and brushing their teeth. Sufferers sometimes cannot recognize their spouses, children or long-time friends. And the family has to cope with not just the trauma of losing a loved member, but also the demands of 24-hour care and vigilance, which can be draining, both emotionally and financially. In the advanced stages of Dementia, the person is bed-ridden and suffers for anywhere between a month and a year. Compared to other countries, India lags woefully behind in Dementia Care.  \r\n\r\nNightingales Medical Trust: Nightingales Medical Trust (NMT) is a professionally managed not-for-profit organization working for the wellbeing of the elderly since 1998. The Trust strives to strengthen family bonds and promote community-based support systems and provides a system of affordable and accessible services, thereby setting new trends in age care. The Trust works towards the welfare of the elderly through various innovative projects focusing on Dementia Care, Active Ageing, Elder Abuse, Social Integration, Empowerment and Capacity Building.",

The decline is very gradual, debilitating and depressing. In the early stages, the afflicted person undergoes memory loss and is unable to recall familiar names and places or everyday objects. Sometimes the person also undergoes personality changes. As the condition progresses, the person gets increasingly dependant on others for even simple tasks like eating, bathing and brushing their teeth. Sufferers sometimes cannot recognize their spouses, children or long-time friends. And the family has to cope with not just the trauma of losing a loved member, but also the demands of 24-hour care and vigilance, which can be draining, both emotionally and financially. In the advanced stages of Dementia, the person is bed-ridden and suffers for anywhere between a month and a year. Compared to other countries, India lags woefully behind in Dementia Care.  <br><br>Nightingales Medical Trust: Nightingales Medical Trust (NMT) is a professionally managed not-for-profit organization working for the wellbeing of the elderly since 1998. The Trust strives to strengthen family bonds and promote community-based support systems and provides a system of affordable and accessible services, thereby setting new trends in age care.

While there are many causes of peripheral vascular disease, doctors commonly use the term peripheral vascular disease to refer to peripheral artery disease (peripheral arterial disease, PAD), a condition that develops when the arteries that supply blood to the internal organs, arms, and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease related?\r\nAtherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. This buildup of cholesterol plaques causes hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. When this happens in the peripheral circulation, peripheral vascular disease is the result. The atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as teens in some people). When atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed, atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. Therefore, many adults typically are unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. However, when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with aging, it can cause critical narrowing of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen).\r\n\r\nPeripheral vascular disease (PVD) definition and facts\r\n\r\nThe term peripheral vascular disease is commonly used to refer to peripheral artery disease (PAD or PAD), meaning narrowing or occlusion by atherosclerotic plaques of arteries outside of the heart and brain.\r\nPeripheral artery disease is a form of arterial insufficiency, meaning that blood circulation through the arteries (blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart) is decreased.\r\nRisk factors for peripheral artery disease include elevated blood cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, inactivity, and overweight/obesity.\r\nA small percentage of people over the age of 50 are believed to suffer from peripheral artery disease.\r\nThe symptoms of peripheral artery disease depend upon the location and extent of the blocked arteries. The most common symptom of peripheral artery disease is intermittent claudication, manifested by pain (usually in the calf) that occurs while walking and dissipates at rest.\r\n\r\nDoctors may use radiologic imaging techniques including Doppler ultrasound and angiography to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease.\r\nPeripheral artery disease can be treated by lifestyle alterations, medications, angioplasty and related treatments, or surgery. A combination of treatment methods may be used.\r\nComplications of peripheral artery disease include sores that do not heal, ulcers, gangrene, or infections in the extremities.

        "description": "Influenza, commonly known as \"the flu\", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as \"stomach flu\" or the \"24-hour flu\". Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. \r\nThree types of influenza viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, the virus is spread through the airfrom coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Influenza symptoms, Influenza Management, Influenza causes, Influenza diagnosis, Influenza Prognosis, Influenza Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Influenza Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Stomach Disease Treatments provides medical treatments info including appendix and other intestinal disease like fibroids.\r\n\r\nPain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an health condition anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (for example, skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (for example, beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called \"referred\" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area.\r\n \r\nAbdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal health problem health problem pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain -- location, timing, duration, infectious disease etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain should be evaluated by a physician.\r\n \r\nThe treatments for gi disorders pain depend on the diagnosis. The majority of conditions which cause stomach ache will pass on their own without medical treatments – for example if you’re suffering from trapped wind or a gastrointestinal.\r\n\r\nIf you think the pain could be related to an underlying stomach condition such as IBS, or you have sharp and severe pain then you should talk to a doctor. If needed they can give you a prescription for digestive health, or discuss some medical information lifestyle changes which could help ease the pain.

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Constipation Guide, Constipation Disease Management & Constipation Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Constipation Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "FEATURES:\r\n-Music that has the perfect mood and tempo for calming the patient, and is familiar to the patient\r\n-Music that is familiar because music carries powerful associations that can calm and comfort the patient.\r\n-This particular playlist will be useful with patients suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease because of its familiar tunes and melodies.\r\n-It is likely to be pleasantly familiar to to all patients that were born in the 1920’s, 30’s, and ‘40’s.\r\n-This is music that has been tested in hospitals, dental clinics, and senior centers around the world and found to be exceptionally soothing, comforting and calming\r\nResearch in music therapy documents that when music therapy is provided for patients in memory care units, they sleep better at night, eat better at meals and are less combative during the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING:\r\n“My father is in his ‘90’s and he loved this playlist! It’s one of the few that he can listen to, sing along, and never tires of it! He even gets up and dances and few steps when certain songs come on.”\r\n\r\n“Every time we take Mom to the dentist, she listens to these songs and time flies for her! Thank you so much for creating this awesome playlist!”\r\n\r\n“This app is awesome! So easy to download and install.

        "description": "Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus(VZV). The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over. It usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches. Symptoms usually last five to seven days. Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections. The disease is often more severe in adults than in children. Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. \r\nChickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is or is not immune. People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Chickenpox Guide, Chickenpox Disease Management & Chickenpox Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Chickenpox Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "title": "Measles: Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
        "description": "Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Complications occur in about 30% of cases and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia, among others. Rubella, which is sometimes called German measles, and roseola are different diseases caused by unrelated viruses. \r\nMeasles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people.

        "descriptionHTML": "Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik&#39;s spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Complications occur in about 30% of cases and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia, among others. Rubella, which is sometimes called German measles, and roseola are different diseases caused by unrelated viruses. <br>Measles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It may also be spread through contact with saliva or nasal secretions. Nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will catch it.

        "description": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia bacteria, spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. \r\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease.

        "descriptionHTML": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia bacteria, spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. <br>Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes.

After all, it works hard - without breaks - to keep you alive, so you should do your part and return the favor.\r\n\r\nWhy else is it important to maintain a healthy heart as you age?\r\n\r\nTaking great care of your heart to avoid cardiovascular disease is critical, but that shouldn't be your only motivator. There are many other reasons to proactively maintain a healthy heart:\r\n\r\n1. To maintain cholesterol and blood pressure\r\nHigh cholesterol levels increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but that's not all. Unhealthy cholesterol in the blood can also lead to heart attack and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nHigh blood pressure levels are even more threatening to your overall health. Besides a heightened risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure, you're also more likely to develop peripheral artery disease, angina, vision loss and kidney disease or failure.\r\n\r\n2. To reduce feelings of depression\r\nDid you know that cardiovascular disease can increase your chance of feeling depressed? Research shows that 33 percent of heart attack victims end up showing depressive symptoms, according to Barry Jacobs, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and director of Behavioral Sciences at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program.\r\n\r\n\"The big message is that people need to be aware of this connection,\" he told the American Heart Association, where he volunteers. \"The second message is that many treatments are available. No one needs to suffer.\"\r\nResearch shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.Research shows that 33 percent of people who have heart attacks end up showing signs of depression.\r\n\r\n3. To lower your risk of developing dementia\r\nThere's a connection between heart health and mental well-being, but it goes beyond feelings of depression. Research shows that poor heart health is also associated with dementia. When you don't properly take care of your heart - with smart lifestyle decisions - you're narrowing your blood vessels, which then limits the amount of blood that can get to the brain. Without proper blood flow, your brain can't work the way it's supposed to and you may have trouble making decisions, reasoning with others and remembering familiar faces and places.\r\n\r\n\"People often associate memory loss with Alzheimer's disease, and they think it can't be prevented or treated,\" said Ralph Sacco, M.D., chief of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and former president of the American Heart Association. \"But controlling your risk factors for heart disease can make a difference in slowing its progression.\"\r\n\r\nHow can I take better care of my heart?\r\nBy making smarter lifestyle choices, you can protect your heart and reduce your risk for developing life-threatening conditions. Making these small decisions can have a large impact on the health of your heart and your overall well-being:\r\n\r\n    Follow a heart-healthy diet\r\n    By eating more nutritious foods and removing unhealthy fats from your diet, you can fuel a thriving heart, reduce your blood and cholesterol levels and maintain your weight, according to the Heart Foundation. Eat more fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, and limit your salt and alcohol intake.\r\n   \r\nDownload the application and learn about foods that prevent heart diseases and maintain a healthy heart.\r\n\r\nGood luck to all and hope the remedies in this application will help you keep a healthy heart \r\n\r\nConsider sharing  this application to family and friends, it would be a huge support to rate this App five star so that people can easily find it in the store.\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out this App!!",

This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), inflammation of the heart, permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. \r\nMumps is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among people living in close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans get and spread the disease. People are infectious to each other from about seven days before the start of symptoms to about eight days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of the parotid duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Mumps Guide, Mumps Disease Management & Mumps Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Mumps Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Download BodBot and start today!\r\n\r\nExercise is a powerful tool for enhancing mental performance and cognitive health. Whether you want to improve your general brain health and memory[1][2], enhance your problem solving abilities[3], reduce your risk of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s[4][5][6][7], or bend metal and shoot lasers with your mind – exercise has an important role to play in all but two of those activities. In particular, richer fitness regimens – regimens consisting of aerobic and resistance training methods[8][1], produce the greatest overall improvements in cognitive performance and neurochemical brain processes. Note, however, working out for sixteen hours each day won’t turn you into the next Stephen Hawking. There are diminishing returns[9], and the favorable cerebral environment promoted by exercise is only as good as the active learning that accompanies it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that exercise has been found to improve a wide range of general health conditions[15][16][17][18][19][20][21], so too does it have wide and positive impacts across the brain. Its effects extend across vascular[22][23], metabolic[24][25], inflammatory[26] [24] and stress-regulating[27] pathways as they exist in the brain. Exercise has been shown to enhance neuronal metabolic and mitochondrial functioning[28][25], decrease oxidative stress in the hippocampus[29][27], and increase mitochondrial machinery[28]. Another way of saying this: working out helps improve the power supply, the work environment and workers themselves in neuronal ‘train stations.’ On the other end, stress, and chronic stress in particular, has been linked to impaired functioning of, and indeed damage to, the hippocampus[27]. Exercise has shown favorable benefits in the regulation of stress (and in particular the management of corticosteroid processes – e.g. cortisol)[27], and may also favorably affect hippocampal memory systems through this process (also potentially leading to improvements in mood and attention if not intelligence). \r\n\r\nMore specific to the process of memory formation and the underlying neuronal structure, exercise has been found to increase levels of hippocampal neurotrophins[32]. Neurotrophins are a class of growth factors centrally important in the development and health of neurons[33]. In particular, increases in a neurotrophin called brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been linked to neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) and improved synaptic plasticity[32][24] [34], producing substantial improvements in memory[24]. In turn, exercise has been found to up-regulate levels of hippocampal BDNF[34]- and much of its impact on memory appears to stem from this process[35]. To make a wild analogy and a gross, but potentially useful, simplification – BDNF is to neurogenesis as testosterone is to muscle growth. \r\n\r\nInsulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is another compound which has been found to enhance neurogenesis and plasticity processes[36][37], and it is similarly upregulated through working out[38][39][40]. Not only does strenuous physical activity lead to positive increases in these compounds, but it can also help regulate hormones which indirectly support them. Active fitness workouts have been shown to help maintain levels of testosterone and estrogen[41][42], which have also been shown to help favorably regulate levels of neurotrophins and neurogenesis [43][44][45][41]. Taken together, the neuronal and synaptic plasticity promoted by these compounds ultimately work to facilitate some of the basic processes of cognition, learning and memory formation such as Long Term Potentiation, or ‘LTP. Exercise appears to have has favorable effects on LTP [46][47][48], most likely mediated by its positive effects on synaptic plasticity generally.\r\n\r\nTo see more on how physical activity impacts cognitive fitness, mood, attention and intelligence see http://www.bodbot.com/Cognitive_Health.html",

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not 😊); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a £iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

        "description": "Back pain is pain felt in the back. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body. Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\r\nBack pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.\r\nBack pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed days off work. Additionally, it is the single leading cause of disability worldwide. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Back Pain symptoms, Back Pain management, Back Pain causes, Back Pain diagnosis, Back Pain Prognosis, Back Pain Epidemiology and history.",

And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you’ve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\n💊A health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n⏰A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app’s mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app’s symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\n💊Motivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."
