            "This app has been fantastic! Completely accurate instantly down to the penny. I also want to add, I have had this app awhile now and I couldn't be more pleased. Someone was taking money out of my account. Huntington caught the suspicious activity immediately. I lost a minimal amount that they are reimbursing. Thank you for saving the rest! Amazing!!!",
            "I find it extremely annoying to be constantly asked if I want to use new tools. These banners get in my way and closing it is just one more step I need to do before having my standard view, without the annoying, unsolicited new feature. It's always something new being offered. At one point I was asked if I want to see how my monthly expenses break down and I said \"No\". But months later it was added to my view anyway. I DON'T care, but they decided I am going to see it anyway. Very annoying",
            "Wheel goes round and round and can't login. Rediculous! It's been weeks now and no help! I still can not use the budget or analysis tools now for weeks. I get no support. The at that is online is so much better, it works. No one seems to care to help. Oh well, that's a shame for Huntington to have an app that doesn't work. What does that say about the bank.",
            "With the Android 11 update, the mobile check deposit was temporarily shut down. When it was available again, the camera options were not functional properly. I was able to take a picture of the front of my check and had difficulty taking a photo of the back of the check. This was because the camera seemed to be distorted oddly, like a fun house mirror.",
            "I have loved the app for years and use it to check my accounts almost daily. However, last week after my pixel did an update, the app is telling me I can't use it for mobile deposits? I don't do very many a year, but hopefully Huntington will upgrade their software soon. Other than that it's great.....but please fix the mobile deposit portion soon!"

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

            "Game's good and all. Haven't played it in a while and now they've expanded it by putting Felix Kjellberg's home country. Which is Sweden in it as Region 65. More guns as well. Like to experience more guns. But thing is. Make it to the point where I don't have to wait till I'm in my early 50's to play. Everywhere I go it's a damn turtle to get to. Thank you!",
            "AWESOME,been playing on and off for about 3years or so, it's a never miss,always great hunts and hidden area's,,,only recommendation I would ask of developer's is to put more hunts in each section to get you the silver,gold, and red coins to be able to get the weapons for each hidden area hunts,,I think all would be ok with more type of hunts in each sections of unique animal's,to get to the hidden area's hunts,in those sections there are awesome animal's to go for,great game,🇸🇯",
            "Meh. Graphics are ok. Controls are a bit erratic. Some of the levels are designed to make you spend energy. Would give at least one more star if the reload button could be moved a bit. It's almost on top of the fire button. So, sometimes you reload instead of shoot. Costs you more energy. That you pay for. Videos for useful stuff are unavailable. But, videos for other things are available. Tiny bit of a money grab. Unless you are extremely patient and like playing for 15 minutes at a time.",
            "Overall an enjoyable game where we can watch videos to gain gold to advance in the game. However..after a couple of weeks the video stopped...so I cant collect gold anymore... Is this your way of forcing players to spend money to buy the gold coz without it its impossible to advance... Gonna wait a few days and see ...if still no video...sayonara to the game....",
            "Awesome. But, what algorithm is the game development company using to ensure that the prices we have to pay as consumers, is worth the gameplay we get for the dollar amount you're forcing ? In other words, prices need to desperately be discussed as a team. Not the best \"bang for your buck\"."

            "The game is very nice, You should add more and better vehicles to be unlocked/bought, 2 isn't enough for the fun of it. I suggest that you add more forest to allow the hunter to explore more places. Secondly an option that allows the hunter to escape or run when a lion is close would do. Last but not least, once the car overturns, a reset button would be helpful to reposition the car",
            "The game is good but the lion attack is too speedful that the hunter cannot escape and dies on the spot and the whole intrest of the game loses. Second thing that there is no running option to the hunter, the hunter can't runs. The hunter only walks. Use of the car is very hard and Everytime we need to accelerate the car to keep it moving. And please add animal voice when the hunter shots an animal and the animal dies instread of human voice.",
            "It is really wonderful game it's graphics it's control Animal running every thing is good and I love to play it but please add some more thing such as level and more jungle and tree village near jungle for making it great",
            "This game is realy entertinig.i love this game very much .It is extra ordinary game.but if the animal come to attack we can't run faster.No more guns.no more vehicles.if you add another places like forest villages etc it will be nice to play the game.pleace change the game option that i text .hope you updaye the game as soon as possible",
            "It is good.. Devloper upgrade this app with new feature like real forest and new gun.. When you can upgrade this app the people must like it and his graphic is not like ral forest graphic you will upgrade this graphic better and best like real forest... I think that you'll upgrade this app .. Authorise this game is good"

Free stuff daily don't have to spend real money to advance. Keep up the good work developers!!!! Best fishing game on android. 5 stars across the board!!!",
            "Really love the game, however like most app games you have to pay to get anywhere. New Halloween event? Pay for a pass to get better prizes. New challenges, pretty nice, if they didn't run entire days of legendary fish that most people don't have. I'm sure there are more casual players that enjoy the game, that wouldn't mind being rewarded. Just a thought. Recommend for wasting time. Progressing or competing, not so much.",
            "this game was fun at first, but it is just a money pit now. The events are only attainable by those with fat wallets. And when the game goes down for more than a day, they give you a booby prize as compensation. Won't be spending any more money or time on it. My advice is don't play unless you're rich and famous IRL",
            "Was brilliant. Have spent over £100 on this game. It's a fix!! You will constantly keep spending money. You'll never have what is needed until you spend, spend and spend more. It lags, freezes and you lose items you have paid for for this. I have contacted them and nothing!! Or they state nothing is wrong. Completely disgusting. What a waste of money!!",
            "I was on level 59 entering 60! Played two months & was winning big, smooth clan, and BAM! Game Updated & started me completely over! Customer support wasn't available to help me get back where I was. Im not starting over at level 1 again. I put too much time n effort into this game. I was logged into Facebook account and Google! It didn't save my process! So I'm deleting the game! Good luck new players. It will happen to you. I was starting the Halloween theme! It really socks! No game 😕"

This is my first credit card and I couldn't be more happier with my experience. This card especially has helped boost my credit so much. I highly recommend to young adults trying to start there credit.",

I have tried to capture my DL over and over with no success. Capital One, most banks and credit unions have a simple way its called verification by text. Get with it.",
            "I love my Capital One card and App. everything is simple and self explanatory. I'm very happy. My card has been scammed and I have tried and tried to get it deleted. It's only a couple of dollars but, it's every month. I called Capital One and they said they will remove it but, it's still there. I tried to call the perp. co. However, there is no number.",
            "I find this app to be extremely beneficial and easy to use. Easily access credit card information and pay threw the app as well. Couldn't ask for a more convenient and safe app for my credit card. They also have a feature to offer you your credit score! Highly recommend. I have not had a single issue with this app or company.",

            "The newer versions have a lot of glitches and is extremely slow. For example, sometimes I add items to my cart and then they all disappear. Sometimes the app will suddenly have every item listed as out of stock and you have to restart. When you add items and hit + to increase the number of items it takes forever. Hopefully they fix these issues.",
            "This new update is buggy and I can't check out. It took me an hour to fill my cart due to all the bugs and when I finally clicked check out of course that failed too and I lost the last pick-up slot of the day and have to go grocery shopping in the snow now... I have a Samsung Galaxy. The bugs were: search wouldn't work, browse by category wouldn't work, the app kept crashing and removing most of the items in my cart, and when I clicked check out it said \"failed to fetch payment.\"",
            "This app gets slower everytime I use it. It's more like a glitch generator, and an anger creator. But, compared to going inside of that level of hell, there's really no difference, other than not dealing with the public clowns and Karen's. I continue to use this app though. Am I a glutton for punishment, or a slave of this corporate world that is left no other options?......yes.",
            "This ap is FRUSTRATING and is getting worse! The screen constantly freezes, it won't allow you to side swipe when you are supposed to be able to and right in the middle of looking at something the screen will go blank to \"update\" the page and sometimes it will come back up to the page you were on and sometimes take you all the way to the very beginning of opening the ap. And it's not my internet because it's very reliable and the ap does this no matter what service I'm using.",
            "I thought it was me!! I literally bought a new phone to see if it would fix the issues. When uninstalling and reinstalling the app I just happened to take a look at the reviews, lo and behold every single person in the world has the same problem I do since they combined the websites,hece it completely sucks. I like everyone on here I'm going to have to use a different online shopping app for a different store because this app is useless."

        "comments": [
            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

            "Ive been using Pandora for three years, and lately I've been having issues. Whenever I choose a specific song on my playlist it doesnt play it and ends up playing a different song on my playlist. I updated it and everything, and it still hasnt been fixed. I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "Used Groupon at launch, when it was actually a bargain site. Nowadays I hardly use it. If you search for goods on eBay/Amazon, 9/10 times they'll be £3-4 cheaper. I only use the app. Was offered 20% off next order, no code, link, or details. Pressed accept and it said it would be applied at checkout, it wasn't. Spoke to four agents on chat, all copy/paste template replies. When I started complaining, all four pretended they couldn't see my replies and that I'd gone idle and disconnected me.",
            "I absolutely LOVE GROUPON! It is the only app I use for my great deals! I get on there atleast 3 times a day sometimes more! The notifications are awesome! && I love how is a variety of things. The up to 97% off some things blows my mind! Such great deals. If you don't have this app its an amazing app and a great way to save money",
            "There should not be this many daily notifications for the little amount of content on this app. The search is garbage. It routinely shows \"deals\" in my area, amd o then find out my area is apparently two states away. Very few business use this anymore. While these are strange times, this was still the case last year. No worthwhile deals. All the goods sold herr are also pretty garbage deals. They can regularly be had on amazon on elsewhere for the same price as their sale price on groupon.",
            "Total waste of time. First, there were not many deals in my area. Then when we traveled with it, there was not much savings. Then it started charging my card when I did not authorize the charge for a \"groupon select\" there is no customer service to call, only email and online chats. I contacted them for the last year telling them to unsubscribe me, each time I was told it went thru. Is an act of God to get them to answer email or the online chats. They are like a bad case of the herpes.",
            "Some good deals, but not all what they seem and customer service is a joke. I paid $21 for 3 days of airport parking and was charged another $40 when I left. According to the Groupon, regular price would've been $30, so I paid twice as much as I would have without the \"deal\". I tried to chat with customer service twice and got no help, then disconnected in less than 1 min while I was typing a short reply, clearly because they didn't want to be bothered, and this is just one example of MANY."

I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

            "I have played this game for 6 years now (even though I have had to start from the start again due to getting a new device) and I think it's just a great game over all it's always got something new for you and it never gets repetitive! (Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

So many stupid ads, and right now I'm stuck on one about mattress and no matter what I do, it pops up and I can't close it, even restarting the app. This game use to be amazing and fun, until it jumped to the Ads hell, now it is a waste of time and space...",
            "I get kicked off the app EVERY time I try to play the upside down games & also when I have to replay a level. It's annoying having to open the app every time and I can't get more than 81 ducks to move up to the next stage. IMO the original Swampy is better but I've finished it. The graphics are not as good either. The only thing I like is combining Swampy, Cranky and Allie games with different levels. Going to uninstall if it's not fixed soon",
            "I played the game without wifi so I wouldn't get too many ads also for it to function and it worked very well. Later it needed me to watch videos to proceed so I switched on my wifi. It started malfunctioning and ads popped up every 3 seconds. Eventually it stopped working. When I went back into the app I found all my progress gone. I tried playing again but when I exited the app it restarted again. I think it is a great app. I had fun. I hope other people don't have the same problem",
            "The game has alot of ads, more than anyone can expect, and bow i reached a level which cant be started without an ad that cant be closed, there is no option to close the ad after it finish and i had to close the game totally and start it again to see the same ad with no option to close it after it finish, not playable anymore, uninstalling it.",
            "This game is wonderful i really like it ,for those who hate it,maybe you're wrong. You have to wait patiently,and i install it and it's playable. There are no ads if you don't use wi-fi,even if i use it,the ads are so a little."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "So when I play the multiplayer game, the aponent's bar will run out and I will still have life but the game will continue on, until I end up losing!!??? Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "The app is great. My only issue comes with jobs not updating if the position is still available. Maybe a notification can be sent via email to the managers of the establishment. Or maybe add an option where it says dates when job was posted. It shows when but you can't categorize it in the search engine. But other than that great app and got me plenty of jobs in the past.",
            "App use to be great, but for some reason it's not working like it use to on my Android phone. I uninstalled and re-installed the App, but it didn't fix my issue. My issue being that when i try to click on a job ad or any of my messages, the App just sends me to a blank white screen and i have let that screen sit while connected to wifi, as well as not connected.. and nothing changes. Always sends me to a blank screen.",
            "Job searching is difficult because it displays jobs that are not related to the search. It is annoying and can be unreliable since it will also displays jobs that you previously searched and applied or visited. It is fine to try your luck. Edit: It has been over a year and this app has not help one bit. I used another website (Career Builder), and I have gotten four interviews in the past two weeks. Now I have a job that suits me. I highly recommend going there instead of using this garbage.",
            "For an app designed to help you find a job, it is not very intuitive. Filling in forms is probably the most frustrating part due to the fact that the app is NOT always formatted to mobile. The automatic information extraction from uploaded resumes is not bad, but when it comes to work experience it always needs fixing. Often, I will get half way through correcting the information, and then have to restart because I hit the wrong button swiping back and forth to read what I typed in the text box.",
            "It's a good App, but I think all the assessments when applying for jobs should be limited to just a few every month, not almost every time you apply for a job! Employers should utilize those questions during the interview process. Sometimes...its just enough to get through the application process, but then you have to do all these assessments too; sometimes employers want more than one assessment! Indeed...you're great, but cut those back some, it's too much!"

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "The game is fun but...you shouldn't have to pay to get one of the pink pack character's or rainbow pack characters it should all be game coins and there is an add at the beginning of each show and there's not even that many things in the show you do like 2 tricks and then you watch another ad!!!!😡😡I was disappointed with the game!That's why it gets 2 stars",
            "I rlly enjoy it but EVERYTHING is ads . I think I spent more time watching ads than play games . Also , alot of things cost money and would not recommend for a little fry . But in all the consept of the game is child friendly but not whith 2 yr olds. Dose anyone else think its wired that you can be a HUMAN!? And no I can't hold my breath for more than 15 seconds thank you very much. I just realized this got random. Well have an awesome day! 'Put a bannana in your ear ' - Jason Steel",
            "The game is very nice to play and good for passing time ,but there is one big problem. The problem is that there are much adds.Only 2 adds of thrill rush and uphil rush are repeated before a level. I am bored because of the adds. Please fix this problem as much faster as you can.",
            "This is very nice game😇 but the reason I gave it 4 stars is This 👀, sometimes it stop working in easy words you can say it become hang😔😔and it takes very much time to start😴 or you can say it takes much time for downloading 😕other wise this is good game 😍you must also download this game😋 it doesn't let the people's bored😏 this is the best game for fun😝 ,enjoyment😜 , happiness😛 and for free time too 😃",
            "This game is sooo cute I won many rounds in the dolphin show and played it all day when I was a kid. This is a dream come true to customize a dolphin of mine and it's a fun game to play for the whole family. I would rather download it now rather than in 2013."

            "Enjoying playing the game. It's so addicting I'm going to have to set a timer. I really like the game but I continually get a network error then the game reloads. With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating 😡 . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers 🤘✌😎",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

I want to continue playing, but im getting over it real quick with the constant shut offs.",

However, recently I have played for about 5 minutes and then get kicked off and it loses everything I did in that 5 minutes. Maybe its just me but if not I hope that can be fixed and if so, it deserves 5 stars Edit: Have had response really quickly, deserves 5 stars! Thank you...problem solved I think it was just me",

Yesterday it crashed a few times and was kind of annoying, but I forgot about it. Now, the game KEEPS crashing as soon as I hit the X for the first pack thing it shows you. I simply cannot get into the game and it is SO frustrating. Please fix it Ludia, because I know it's not my computer.",
            "The games nice. It's just that when I watch the ads that allow you to skips some time, it crashes on me. The ads completely stop working and the screen sometimes turns black. If you wait long enough the game kicks you out. Please fix this glitch. I wanted to skip sometime to quickly get my dinosaur. Last thing, anyone reading this, try to avoid the ads as they might crash on you. I have a S9 so it's weird how the game is crashing on me."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "This is my best game on my phone. It'll be so good in the future also. It's not a bad game at all to. The graphics are perfect, a variety of characters, weapons are plentiful. One thing is that chests have an unplentif amount coins so maybe put a bit more coins in chests. Anyway good game, A plus graphics, a new Bat? I could never think of that!",
            "It's an fun and very addicting game, but I get matched with players 10 × my level. I'm on level 1 right now since I've just been introduced to it. I can't play the game due to the fact that I am dead in a matter of 15 - 20 seconds. My teammates will not give me a chance to grab the weapons either. Also, the items are a bit overpriced. I will redownload this game once these issues are resolved.",
            "When i subscribe to a weekly subscription, it's fail to showing me that i subscribe. I restore purchase many times, sometimes work and sometimes not working. I contact help disk and he bretend that my subscription is over, while i just took one day for 7 days !! It's a joke. There are alot of hackers whom I can't report!!! Believe or not, you cannot report them. He can kill as much he can, and no one can stop him. Please Don't waste your time and money, until they fix there issues!",
            "Game is very addicting but clearly pay-to-win, you cant play without it. My problem was that after I made a purchase, the game stopped loading. \"Something went wrong\" everytime I logged in. I tried to get a refund but no response. Very unhappy, I had high hopes seeing the advertisements but it's a RIP off!",
            "Great game I have about 9 character and they are just great this game is my most greatest game that I have. Just asome. Update, it's been about 2 years since I gotten a new character. It starts to get boring and I haven't played some time. Every timei get a golden crate, I always expect nothing out of it. Dont get your Hope's up. Look at me I got bored of a game that I loved for soooooo long and. It's starting to make me feel like why did I get this game. The point is the character percentage."

Messenger had videos that played. That was tolerable but this is terrible. I have requested assistance to get my old game back. But it seems nobody is interested. Game play .... Go Figure, I can't post until every star is filled.",
            "05/10/20: Enjoying this 4 Pics 1 Word game. The only 2 issues were, I couldn't locate the instructions, so when it asked if you wanted to pay to receive a hint, I thought it was with cash, and the Hints took some time to appear. The ads don't bother me too much. 24/10/20: I like the change made where a Free Letter is provided to help figure out the Word.",
            "Used to love this and decided to recently install it again. I was just disappointed with the amount of advertisement that shows up ever few levels. The worse part is that the advertisement is non skippable for 30 seconds! I don't usually mind advertisements but that's just too much. I unistalled it less than 10 minutes of starting the game.",
            "I have played this game on and off for more than 10 years now. I have played it on 5 different telephone. I really enjoy the game. I think the cost for a hint should be about 50 and then each correct answer you get should be around 15 to 20. It seems ludicrous to me to pay 60 points for a hint when you only get for each time you saw off one.",
            "Too many ADs , every other level an AD pops up. I installed after about 10 minutes of playing , after level 29 or so the ADs seemed to be getting longer! I used to love this game a few years ago, now with all the ADs and pop ups it's very annoying."

In this latest update, we’ve gotten rid of some of those creepy crawly bugs to make sure you can continue watching your Huluween favorites. Update your Hulu app today and get back to streaming!.",

            "This app is great. Lots of options. However, it irritates the friggin piss outta me that even though the app has been around for years and they're mostly known for their TV shows, they still don't have a Skip Intro option! If I'm binge watching a show, I don't wanna have to watch the intro every single freakin time! Disney+ has it and they haven't even been out for a year yet! Like why hasn't that been added yet!?",
            "Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming.",
            "I've never had an issue with this program in all the years I've used it, however, NOW I DO and I need to uninstall and reinstall, but there is NO way that I found to do that, yet.... What a serious pain and it shouldn't be. This is my home computer, and this shouldn't be a national secret how to do this! I'm soooo damn annoyed. The program loads just fine, but soon as I click a play arrow it freezes everything. I looked at the tools/inspect page, it clear shows the play path has been altered somehow. I don't do computer coding or maybe I could fix this myself, but it should be a simple fix to uninstall and reinstall like you would on your phone. I'm 65 years old, I am running Windows 7 because I like it. This really shouldn't be happening.",
            "Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But \"watching\" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my \"next up\" list before the show I am interested ends.",
            "I love Hulu I will always have it on my phone! I usually never have a problem and if i do, the app some how fixes its self. If i disconnect i just reload and its fixed. I have never had a issue that prevented me from watching my favorite adult cartoons. The price is good the content is awesome! I can always find something to watch for what ever situation. Hulu is doing everything right in my book!"

            "One of the best mobile games I've ever played, not even including the fact that I have almost every single ubisoft game, but this is the first mobile ubisoft game I have actually liked. There are some things that could be better, like the death animations and the kill animations, but other than that it's an amazing game, 11/10 would recommend.",
            "It's really great! I've been playing this game for a while now and it always entertains me. Would've given it five stars but there's a problem. The game crashes when my shark dies and then when I reopen it, I don't get the gold or exp I had earned. It doesn't happen always, but the crashing rates have increased. Please fix it... It's hard to play 10mins in one round and then earning nothing at all. Thank you.",
            "This game is super awsome! But just one thing about it: The larger sized sharks. Once you get near one you pretty much can't escape unless you have a lot of stamina. And once you die from them and press the \"Save me!\" button you have almost no time to swim away, and then they bite you once and you're almost dead. I just think you need to give an 8 second head-start before the larger sharks can catch you.",
            "This game is so freaking awesome!!! However, the control system could use a ln addative, a joystick option that keeps the joystick in a fixed place down in the left hand corner, oh and the health drain is ridiculous! Health shouldn't drop that rapidly, you should maybe.... fix that, please? Other than that? GREAT game!",
            "This game is amazing. No pay to win. Great amount of skippable ads. You eventually get every shark from grinding enough. I just grinded out 280 gems and bought the Robo-Shark. Great time killer. Especially without Wi-Fi :P Get this game it's so worth it. Ubisoft, this game is amazing and almost perfect. Just a bit of tweaking and this game is number one. Great job!"

            "Like most of these HO games, things are frequently impossible to see, even zoomed in, on a phone. Other than that, great game. Enjoying it so far. Nothing innovative but visually beautiful and cute story. Edit; (Four stars down to two).Since the last update, buying extra seconds has more than doubled in price in an already VERY expensive game. More and more ads do not result in tools or time .",
            "This is a great hidden object game ❤️I've been playing for ab 2 years now, it is a little difficult at times but that's kind of the point,right? Great game, definitely worth playing. Only problem I have is it takes to long to get the items necessary to enter rooms,for example: ammo for hunting room,yellow balloons for Japanese garden other than that no complaints,ty for a great game!",
            "Good and fun game. The time limit is not enough for the rooms especially to twilight chamber room. Always want to buy extra 40secs from diamonds. Every single thing should be bought only via diamonds. No use of coins we earn. Match 3 are always the same. Again and again coming same levels. Irritating of playing the same again.",
            "This is my third review for this game.... I had only gave 3 stars last time because I was upset over an incident that happened with a purchase I made. After I left my review I noticed I had a response on here and that they would try to fix the problem, but unfortunately I had a phone issue and had to restart my game on a new phone, so it didnt matter anyway. I hadnt had any issues prior to that and I havent had any issues since then plus I absolutely love this game, so 5 stars it is.",
            "The game was pretty good for less than a week... The further you go the less free options are left. It's just became very frustrating and not really fun at all. Really hard to find objects and for every extra time and trophies you gotta pay or wait pretty looong. Well I had a good 1 week game. Ok 👌 not anymore I guess."

            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

Surely it does not match the most accure sounds with their real animals like, look it, Rhinoceros and Wolf sounds there is big different with their real sounds and ones in this app even Zebra and dog, and others still not accurate sounds. Too fake the sound of Mosquitoes. Totally it's misleading one avoid it. For me I will not recommend this for anyone.!"

            "I love it, I got scammed a while back in a raffle but other than that it's a really fun game. It's fun to see that it has been updated and kept alive, it does warm my heart! It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

The team works hard to bring you an exciting new chapter every week. Uncover a new mystery in June&#39;s Journey every Thursday.",

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "Toooooo many ads still... and thats the main reason I will b deleting the game. Always watch this ad to get an advantage. Watch an ad to get a boost. And if you don't use the boost you lose it. Only thing I am sorry for is spending money on here. Paid to get no ads. All rewards and bonuses have ads.",
            "Took away thousands of dollars from league score. Lots of glitches. Says videos available for reward buy then says not available. Did not give me credit for a big auction that I used kick outs on. Game glitches continue. Often says I didn't watch full video. Now special lockers don't have the items guaranteed. A month later still no better. A month later, just happened again",
            "I cannot give this game 5 stars since you are obliged to watch a ridiculous amount of them. In addition, getting VIP doesn't give any daily gold and you still need to watch ads to get powerups and other things. They want you to spend money AND watch ads which is unfortunate. Lastly, sometimes the computer will over bid all rooms so you cannot progress. In addition, it's almost impossible to win big as it seems the computer will bid close to its worth. Other than those issues, this game is fun.",
            "The energy tokens you need to play the game are so slow to arrive, it's painful. It's also weird that the game builds in something to stop folk from playing. Edit: I've uninstalled it just one day later. The ads were annoying enough but sometimes when you try to close them the game crashes and you lose precious tokens it's simply not bearable. I swear I spent much longer watching ads than I did playing the game. Oh, and a couple of screens you can't close so you have to quit losing more tokens.",
            "I love the game but it's just not updating because I'm on level 43 and it keeps saying that the new levels are coming soon and it's been 3 months!! Great game but we can't get any further than level 43, frustrating that it says coming soon !!! Update again today and it's still stuck on locker 42??? Please sort this out ive been waiting ages to progress in the game"

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

Last update has the banners across game almost impossible to move and stuck on 1872 with last phase there are no diamonds to actually pass the level. Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",
            "I like this app. Actually I am playing this game since 2017... What I like the most is there is NO ad that will pop up... even your Wifi is on... there will never be an irrititation in this game😍",

            "This game is a random game, I like it for the fact that it makes you think but as an offset it drops stuff you can not think about. If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "Updated 10/31/20: The app is totally unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but I can't hit a single button on it. Completely useless. Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "This is a very fun game. It has one big issue though that really drives me crazy. Sometimes I put down a decoration or a statue and it disappears, the one time I went into my game and all my statues were gone! It's mainly just been decorations thats been disappearing now but I work so hard for them and it's gone. Please fix this bug and I will rate this game 5 star again. Over all, this is a very fun game, maybe fix the gauntlet spins to get better prizes, but everything else is great!",
            "Typically a fun and well working game. However, I have struggles when speeding up and watching an ad, after watching it and pressing the x to exit that ad. 6 times out of 10 I will have to exit the app due to the screen greying out and constantly changing to my home screen and the grey screen of the game. When I exit the app and re-enter, I lose the speed up. This does happen occasionally throughout the game but mostly on ads.",
            "The game is, well, decent. It is fun at times; you can train dragons, defend Berk, and unlock powerful additions to your team. The only problem I have with this game is the ads. Oh the ADS. I'm aware you need ads to keep the game running, but it gets so overly excessive. It feels like the Dragon Rider memberships is a pay-to-win system. I feel like if you could remove some things only exclusive to Dragon Riders and make them available to all players, membership or not, I'd say 5 stars.",
            "The game itself is interesting and the goals are challenging enough, the game deserves 4 stars but the customer support is negligible and a total let down. I purchased a bonus pack and did not receive my items, I tried numerous times to contact support via the in game bot and via the developer website to no avail. As a paying member I find this really disappointing. Also the dragon spins tend to just give you useless things and not the collective items.",
            "I love this Game. I've been playing for years ! They keep growing it and improving it and adding to it. My Berk is huge and I have so many dragons. Always new challenges and gauntlets and dragons. They dress it up for the seasons Berkstyle. Plus you can get costumes for your dragons. The babies are adorable. I'll never stop playing. It's good because you can do a little or a lot."

            "For the most part this game is fun and I love the animals. However, I am sick of the World cups events they force players to play. The purpose I get. The game makers want to create more levels. That world cup would possibly be cool if I reached max level and still wanted to play. I am three levels from maxing out and can only play a night or two during the week and weekends. At least once a month they put on a world cup during the only time I can play. I am considering deleting the game.",
            "In my opinion, not only is this game extremely entertaining for ALL ages, but the graphics are nice and I believe that through this game and others you have created will remind everyone how precious the flora and fauna truly is on the Earth and be better stewards of it from now on. I'm sure that wasn't the original premise that you thought of when you designed the game, but my experience has given me an appreciation of what we have around us. Great job y'all and keep 'em coming. BRAVO !!!!",
            "Great game. Starting to get really challenging.its getting better and better, I love the way there are so many ways to match and cause big bangs. Have come back to this game and wow just wow. It has been upgraded and updated. It looks much slicker and the graphics are chunkier, if that makes sense. Really enjoying it and I'm enjoying setting up the zoo. I'm now on level 886 and I am missing my little helpers so much. I've seen this game develop into a really great one so please bring them back",
            "Fun, with enjoyable graphics and gameplay, until I hit level 70. Been stuck for over a day now, use my lives up so fast, and it takes 20 mins to get a single life back. Might uninstall due to apparently impossible level. Also, playing with a friend, and we have seemingly random/different decorations and levels, and unlock things differently. Very odd. If the level is made easier/lives regen faster & stuff made slightly less random will give 5 stars",
            "I really like this game, it can be quite challenging on some levels but I find eventually you get through. I have bought extras for it but I feel you don't need to buy diamonds and power ups which I think is great. Would definitely recommend it as a fun destressing game."

And the reason why i didnt give it 5 stars its becouse of their delivery amount, its too expensive .",
            "Very easy to use and so far the clothing quality has been pretty good. I have 4 stars because I think more work should be done on the website interface to make it adapt to pc better. It's very difficult using Shein on my laptop. Additionally, I would love if the Taiwan site can add an option to change the language (although billing and clothing descriptions and searches are in english), the headings are in chinese. The sizing is sometimes wayy off. Always use reviews to try to gauge your size.",
            "I love this app. I think it is super easy to use. I also think it works way better than the website. No matter what device I am on, the website seems to be kind of difficult and slow, but the app is much faster and easier to use. Plus the prices of everything are so low! If you love shopping for things that are inexpensive bit still great quality, this is the app for you.",
            "This app has all the things you never knew you need! Clothes, accessories, home gadgets, even a few things I use in my salon i love it all! When I look up dresses it gives me an option for modest dresses, what a great feature! I'm a mom and proud of it, so there is no need to flaunt too much chest or super high cut dresses, thanks Shein! Everything I've ordered through this app has been great quality and even better prices! Highly recommend!",
            "Pretty good! So genuinely this app is really good. Definitely WAY better then Forever 21. There are so many good deals and cute clothing! The clothing looks like the pictures on the app! I've seen only good reviews. I haven't ordered anything yet, but definitely get this app!! ❤❤"

            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "Great fun game but I dont have any other maps...its stuck at saying coming soon. Also I'm maxed out at the last worm level 66 and the campaign+ is stuck at level 19 because my worm level is too low. Is this because I'm playing the free version?",
            "Action packed and fun game. It is the best free game out there in my opinion.",
            "Such a very good game but you don't have more worms and maps",
            "I haven't played yet, but I'm so happy to see this here, even if it doesn't quite live up to the original, it's still nice to see something from my childhood being brought back, regardless of how the game plays, I appreciate all that put in the effort to bring this back, it really is a blast from the past, and I'm all for it! Let's just hope it can at least come close to the OG!!!"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

But of course, I don't have any gems and gems cost real money. And, there's no way to earn gems through game play, so no more free spins! We'll see what happens from here, but I may be deleting this game.",
            "Good game. Few things I didnt like was it forces me to use my extra help options on the beginning of the game. Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",
            "Please add the new features in the next update of the game, game data save with social accounts and improvements on UX design like the main lobby display with the fresh new look! And one more thing please add more characters in this game. Next, please label the game levels with colourful background with difficulty indicator on the level number for example, no indicator for easy levels, skull indicator for hard levels and horned skull indicator for super hard levels just like Candy Crush Saga do",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "They actually did a pretty good job of adapting it to the smaller screen on the phone. The puzzle is done in sections. You can choose the number of pieces, turn rotation on or off and change the scale. I LOVE the background music by Ruslan Gumbatov! There are daily puzzles and missions but I don't bother with those, I play it to relax, not to collect rewards.",
            "I've loved this app for a long time now and it's one of the few that I even bought! **Edit**Oct 17 (dropped to 3 stars) I'm disappointed in the new layout of the daily and My Puzzle packs. I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",

You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle.

            "UI has confusing layout. Political posturing on the front page but no 'check in' button to be seen.

I have verified ID in app and 6 stays, only thing that happened is my card blocked an attempted charge one time. I verified that card and nope, still denied. Support claims the host rejected my request, they are lying. I have two days to find something else and my car was just totaled. These dinks unreliable",
            "We have used Airbnb many times both for overnight stays and experiences. The site itself is ready to use and accurate. I appreciate the feature that shows what the total will be because sometimes cleaning fees are extreme and a person needs to know that before they commit. I also like when there is clarity about specific cancellation fees for each location.",
            "Today I am very pissed off. I booked a location through this app about a week ago and today I am trying to make another reservation and they are saying my account has been locked for security proposes. Every time I try to review my account to it sends me back to the same log in screen. There is no number to call and fix the problem and I can't get around the log in screen.",
            "I have been using Airbnb application for more than three years and the fact that it has the same bugs from time to time is unacceptable. The switch account button appears and disappears. Even when it \"decides\" to appear some of the times it does not \"remember\" the codes of the switched account. But to make it even better after I log in to the other account I see in the listings panel listings of the previous account I just logged out. If I had space I would write more. Totally unprofessional.",
            "I love the idea, and regularly use Airbnb, but I'm keen to jump ship for the first competitor who allows me to access the original posting for the booked trips within the app. I find it incredibly irksome to be forced to a computer for one of the most frequently desired actions that logically should be available in the app. I often need to revisit to confirm details from the pictures etc but you simply can't here. If it wasn't for communicating with hosts, I'd uninstall and do desktop only."

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "Used to be a brilliant game and loved playing. However within the past week app constantly crashes, especially when trying to use Boosters. Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",
            "It's a fun game but you have to admit you cheat. How do I get all but 1 pet off the board and you don't drop pets or the color blocks. If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",

I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags. If you notify the team.. u simply get A very automated! Sorry & ur told to sign in & out of Facebook. .this will solve the issues... well it dose NOT! Solve the constant issues & nor dose it help. 😡",

            "Love my Alexa !!! I've had Her ever since, 2017 and I'm still finding new stuff that she can do. And these times exspesly us older folks, sometimes we're lucky to even to talk to anyone for days. It's so nice to just set back and get Alexa to play me back home to family that have long since gone So when I feel sad., I can just listen Soo many good memories. As for me I'm am very happy to have her here . God Bless each and every one 💞 who made her. And God Bless all",
            "Alexa is linked to my tv but not controlling it at all that I see. App takes a lot of space. I deleted it, it only did the things I can use w/out app. Alexa always says sorry I don't know. It says it's connected everywhere it should be but it doesn't work I guess. I've only been able to set reminders, timer and alarms. Play a silly skill. That's all and I can do all that without app? Oh and drop in, which does require app but I had to delete like 6 apps to download and I have over 100gb memory?",
            "This application is really old school, in the sense that it lags a lot and has some of the worst UI and performance I've seen in the smartphone era. I've used it to control/set up my echo and fire TV but the experience has been dreadful across multiple devices. There are issues with scrolling, changing pages and going into menu. Hope the developers address these persistent issues with the UI.",
            "Just timed it with a stopwatch 5,5 seconds to start the app. Another 11 seconds to load the shopping list. Same issue in all our devices with the app, on flagship phones and tablets purchased within the last 2 years, 2 of them just months old. Cmon..... Not acceptable. Also as a notice that might not be related to the app. The echo dots are getting worse and worse at listening and currently they lag so much that you can't even play Spotify without sounding like bad reception due to the cutouts",
            "Voice commands for devices are quite often great but then for no reason at all the devices just stop working. Very unreliable. The alexa app seems to be fine, but for some reason it changes the words you use to operate the devices with. At first it seems pretty amazing. But later on it is just not as reliable as it needs to be. Definitely not letting ai control anything like a car or dangerous item. I don't think they will ever get it to work well enough to be trusted."

            "Dev's team there is a bug: the interface and all the gameplay is so fast that it just not playable anymore. Bugs: 1.Interface is more responsive, simple touch opens up 2-3 options. 2. Not able to play any track, the overall gameplay speed of bike is increased to 10times as of normal gameplay speed. 3. Unable to connect to server error when opening showdown section. Looking forward for the fix soon.",
            "Game's really fun , like the physics of the game , how every bike felt unique in terms how it feels , but i do have a complaint about a bug I am encountering at the moment where my game sort of crashes every time i opened up the map...i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game and logged back in to my account but it still keeps happening...would like to have you try and fix this issue for me , it would be really helpful. Otherwise good game , keep up the good work devs",
            "Played Trials since the 1st one, big fan! :) This one, like all the other Trials games, gets quite hard after a while..But still fun & addicting. Been playing this version for about a year. Theres always more to do/unlock. One downside, there hasnt been any of the different big holiday events for the last several holidays. I was hoping thered be a halloween event this month like last halloween. So sadly the games hayday might be over? Hope devs dont quit this one yet, still has a ton of players.",
            "Love this game but i come out of the bike shop and it says downloading latest content and that's it. Doesnt download. I'm connected to the internet and everything is fine in my end. The game just wont download. It really angers me because I love playing this game. I had it about a year ago and it was great. I re downloaded it and could only do 5 missions and then it says its downloading latest content but doesnt, and I cant play while it's doing that. I can't play the game at all now.",
            "Amazing graphics and ATD. I love everything about the game. And you never get too good of bikes to just breeze through the game. My only problem is that terracotta is made to make you better. As well as make you use timesavers. When you race him at the mill, he uses the only timesaver there. Making it extremely hard."

            "This is the coolest match 3 rpg I've ever played. The tutorial is lacking, especially about spells and the repair mechanics don't account for the last ad watch. I just want to keep playing. The art is phenomenal. FIX AD REPAIR mechanics: totally fubar. The countdown variable doesn't work. However, the game is awesome! The artwork is killer. The meditate function is so cool. The off world mechanics to level up are totally cool. Take advantage of off world. Love this game.",
            "For me addictive, it's like a D&D kinda board game you go around squares and encounter various things monsters,caves etc also not a hugely P2W game BUT upgrade your gear as if not you'll get slaughtered I've only spend under £40 and I'm battling monsters with double my HP. Also make sure you have decent spells",
            "Do not download this game!!! They cheat on so many levels to try to force you to pay money. Tried numerous ways to play the game without forking over the dough - impossible!",
            "This game is incredible so much fun. Combines tiles combat with reg style game play. Just incredible. I have yet to see a game that is similar. You will enjoy it if you gibe it a chance",
            "Game sucks cause it gives all the skulls that u use to do damage with to the computer characters. U get 2 sets of skulls out of 20 for like 20 or 30 damage and most enemies r at least at 80 hp. Give the skulls to the player 2. No wonder everybody deletes it. Only care about money."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "The App works well. I was forced to use it at it was impossible to access ebay messages using a mobile. The moment you tried it would send you back to the main page(same thing happened when using \"desktop\" mode). My feeling is this was a deliberate act to force people to download and use the app. While the app works fine, you were able to do exactly the same thing in the web browser, there is no real advantage to using the app over browser. If its not broke down fix it.",
            "We are dedicated buyers of Ebay. Most of the time we have no issues. With that being said my 4 star rating is for a couple reasons 1) When you search for a specific item and it shows same,similar items there it is the very item I searched down below! Why show me the very item I clicked on??? 2)when 2 or more people share an account if they're was a way to make gift purchases where the other person/s are not able to see an item was purchased even just for the Holidays maybe with a pin number JS.",
            "Hello & Good Morning To You. The best part of shopping eBay is finding the best deals. Always get what I'm looking for and sometimes get \"free shipping\". That's great right! Most oftentimes, end up with more in the cart than previously planned. The best part of shopping eBay is when a seller does us wrong. Ebay steps up and gives one a full refund. Thank You for that eBay. Get what you're looking for at eBay.",
            "The ebay app is \"sort of ok\", but there is certainly room for improvement. One thing I would like to see on the app would be an \"advanced search facility\" like there is on the computer version of ebay. This enables buyers to use very specific search criteria, and is very helpful. I would like to believe that feedback of this nature are seriously considered, and hopefully impemented.",
            "Excellent buying experience. Let me give you a little secret a lot of people don't know. Ebay offers lower prices than Amazon on a wide variety of merchandise. The only area of disadvantage for Ebay is Amazon's advertising and 24hr customer service contact availability. Nevertheless, I buy with confidence when shopping with Ebay and its online sellers."

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "I absolutely love this app! Moving away from the big tech companies is doing this human really good!! I don't like to be influenced in my advertising or my feeds. Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "I've loved this game for years and keep coming back to it, but why are there SO MANY ADS?! There are wayyy too many of them! Shoved in my face between runs! I think watching a 30-second ad to double my coins and spin the wheel is pretty much enough, but between runs is way too much. Please reduce the ads and I'll gladly give a five star.",
            "Update 10/23/2020 - the game has been loading every time for a few days now. Perhaps I just had a system update that affected this app for a period of time. Just happy all is working now. Also, I reached out to the developer contact Google provided and the Rodeo Stampede team got back to me within 48 hours with some troubleshooting steps. My app started working again so I didn't reply, but I'm confident they have a good team who can help resolve problems. ---- Older review: I love love love this game, but it crashes every single time I try to load. Restarting does not help, and I'm afraid uninstalling will erase all my hard work building my zoo. Spent $15 in the first few days to get rid of ads, but now the game won't even load.",
            "Rodeo Stampede is a very good game, with fun gameplay and cool new characters and animals to tame. The graphics are pretty bad, but I know that's the point of the game (kinda like Minecraft). I got to Tundra 3, then the game started getting pretty boring, because I had already unlocked most of the animals and done many missions. For anyone who's looking at getting Stampede, it is a very good game and you can play it for ages without it getting boring. I highly recommend this game.",
            "While I think this game is quite fun and very good in concept, it's desperate for your money and absolutely shameless about getting as much of it out of you as possible. The microtransactions are absolutely not worth the money, especially not the subscriptions- one being four dollars a week (yes, you read that right, not per month, per WEEK), and the other being EIGHT DOLLARS A WEEK, which is utterly obscene. Do not spend your money on this game.",
            "I can't lie I hate mobile games and their ads but this game is gold it's an hidden gem I would say. I remember playing this long time before but never loved it as much as I do now . I only have one problem though the ads . It's ok to have ads as rewards as for extra live and to finish the breeding between animals faster but seriously every time I die and press restart to play again I get 30 sec unskipable ads everytime plz look in to that . Other that that 11/10 I love it :)"

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given.

            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

So get in quick, bare your fangs and show us your best spooky burnouts!<br><br>We also have another HUGE update just around the corner!

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Last update was Jan 2019. I bring that up as no support for Android 10 or 11. Clearly developers abandon this game and didn't bother to take it out of Play Store. Putting that aside, ads will randomly start playing and will play every time you exit the game. Overall, lack of updates, too many ads, and poor graphics, I do not recommend this game.",
            "So much ads but meh the ads that i see if it looks like a fun game i get it that why i like ads and gave this a five star 🌟 its such a fun game i had it when i was a kid and i am just now geting it so its so much fun i love this game and games like this are fun so keep up the good work and dont Lise to the people that say your gane is bad there just jealous that you guys have a good game and that they cant make a super special game like this its the best game ever. Thx for the good game. By.",

I absolutely love this game to making me 💯% calm and more much better relaxing while I'm stoned. 😵😵😵😜😂👌 Irishman41 😁👍🤑🤑🤑🙌🙌🙌",

            "The actual game is entertaining and fun. There is a lot more to it than I thought. The main problem I had was the lack of notch support. I am running the game on my Pixel 3XL and some of the screen is cut off. It doesn't hinder the gameplay specifically but it's hard or impossible to see the achievements that pop up for nitro boost. Overall the gameplay is fun, and I've enjoyed it.",
            "I gave this app 5 star, perhaps for the improvement to the game in betterments of graphics, more sports bikes and motoGP racing characters, make bikes' meter console little realistic. Characters needs to lean more in high speed so that it will looks so much better like a real life. Top speed and the breaks are amazing but the handling needs to improve. I think vehicles are too much on the highway. For me Maps are really good, if include isle of Man tt map this will be the best moto racing game❤️",

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

        "comments": [
            "This is a super fun mining game that reminds me of Steamworld Dig. I keep coming back to it. My two complaints are that it's too easy to die (gotta make you use up your hearts) and the art style is not the best. I think it's going for Minecraft's blockiness, but also wants more realistic hair and bodies so it feels odd.",
            "Frustratingly difficult, by a lot. Often, deaths happen in ways that feel unfair/unavoidable no matter how well I play. And while adding new bosses (\"kings\") with each update might feel to some people like just keeping the content fresh, to me it feels like constantly moving the goalpost in the worst way possible, both because I'm a completionist and because I find the contributions the bosses make to the playing field purely frustrating rather than fun.",
            "Updated as recommended, You gave me 30 \"lives/turns\" then cheated me out of them by suddenly freezing game in mid-motion, then locking up & starting it over - without the scored items & added \"turns\". (It's such a coincidence that this freeze/cheat/start over only occurs when I'm doing well.) I njoy a challenge, but resent cheating intensely. One day you won't be able to \"sell\" ads bc nobody will trust it or you. So be it.",
            "I originally got this game to get some free rewards in another game...tried it and couldn't put it down. Now I play it more than the game i was getting rewards for lol.It gets better the longer u play. Upgrades and new challenges and game modes. I love the pvp aspect of it also. 5*s from me. My only problem is I wish u could use the golden booster when u wanted to. Great job devs and thx for the amazing game!",
            "Awful controls, saddening payout and massive amount of forced ads alongside the optional ones. My biggest problem is with the controls, that mostly it either doesn't change direction when prompted or randomly does. It's like a puppy in training: trying to follow orders yet wonders off often. The game content is pretty good and the visuals are perfect for this game which makes me sad as I can't wait to uninstall Dig Out! once the offer in my other game is complete."

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "The least you could do if you're going to flood a game with ads is give people the choice to pay to stop the ads. I mean, if you want people to have incentive to buy imaginary game currency, at least make it worth while to support your game to remove ads too. Also, it's not fair to make all the best guns cost gems. But that's pretty typical for a phone game these days.",
            "Great game once you get the hang of it. Too many ads though and if you get right to the end, there is a glitch. Your screen goes dark and you can't see anything and you get killed within seconds. FIX this issue and you have a very good game. There is even a glitch in the game where you can get 12000 pieces of gold with ease, but that I will keep to myself until the end glitch is sorted ;)",
            "This reminds me of some fps arcade games i used to play. Love it! What i don't like, the reason i give 3 stars, you have to pay to win. Requires too much time and effort in regular play to advance.",
            "best zombie game ever. i know, alot of people complaining about ads, turn off wifi. thats so easy. if you complain about having to spend money, actually you dont have to spend any single nickle. so calm down. its a good game. the developers have to get money so they put ads. the developers have to get money, so they put ingame purchases. so what?",
            "This game would be AWESOME if the damned prices for new guns were not so high. That problem alone makes the game unenjoyable to play. Either drop the prices of each of the weapons or give higher rewards for finishing quests or missions."

            "DON'T PLAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! It would be a nice game but unless your willing to spend money your not going to get anywhere. Its ridiculously difficult to get any 💎's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough 💎's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",
            "Awesome game....just not enough free options. The game is initiated with you're having to purchase."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",

            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

            "I enjoyed this game but it now very frustrating because it is so hard to win any games. Like ridiculously hard. It never used to be like this. Truly sad as I've put a lot of time and money into this game, it shouldn't be the only way you win is to spend money on power ups.",
            "Great game, beautiful graphics and themes. Fun to play, requires strategy- as you advanced and level up-, it becomes harder- but I love that there's also extra rewards and power up earned as you advanced.",
            "Like the game . But? I know on Android I can not even make a log in for jam city . The app will not open my keyboard so I can type it in my email. Ugh the pain . Please fix on pixel 2 xl running android 11",
            "I like that you can use any unlocked character in the journey levels and switch at any time. However, the events in the game usually do not hold my interest. I would like to see more Hans-related things, such as his alternate outfits for playable characters and his statue for a collectible to go with the other main characters."

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "this game is a lot of fun for the first 50 levels or so. but after that the levels become almost impossibly hard to complete. I've been playing this game for about 30 to 45 minutes every day for the last 7 months and I still haven't reached level 200. There are over 1200 levels! Even if you spend real money, the way they allow you to use the perks you purchased are so severely limited as to almost the useless. #developer - please add in an option to be able to skip hard levels!",
            "I really enjoy the game, and there's so much to do. I'm on level 980 in a month and a half and its really easy to get starts. The characters are really cute and the stuff you have to build is to. I have no problem but when you get the flower thing where it gets all of that one color, you need a lot. You need about like 15+. But yeah I recommend this game!!!",
            "This app gets one star for one reason. If I'm playing and I have to take a call or respond to a text. The game starts over and you lose your progress for that level and a life. App designers keep forgetting what a CELL PHONE'S MAIN PURPOSE IS. The game might be cool, but its all irrelevant due to the audacity of the designers who think their silly little game is the most important thing in your life.",
            "Incredible and amazing and cute game! The one thing that i want to fix is can we please have a chance to unlock sally for free without soending money? I really love sally and if you do that i will never ever delete this incredible game but if you cant its ok i will try to get her next year. Btw still amazing game",
            "It wont let me download the 34 mb of additional data to access a story...please fix. It's the hot air balloon one. Other than that the game is perfect! I can play for hours!"

            "Can't log into my account anymore. I've played for 6 years with no problems, now in the last 3 weeks I've had more issues than I can count trying to log in. I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

Boosters and other extra materials of the game you can get in daily gift or buy in store.\" is BS! Who is testing these games? The time levels especially the ice cream levels takes so many tries to beat. The time shouldn't start until the people order shows. The coins should be used for boosters or gems. Addictive but NOT WORTH IT!",

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "Another update and I still can't get to expert picture settings. Now I get an error that says to restart the TV. I do this and still same error. Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

However, I would like to feedback that there is no option to choose for wish cash for the pay later option. It would be more convenient for this function to be available. And also, the refund details only state the full purchase to be refunded and not the 1st installment that was actually paid. Kindly update that into the order details. Thank y",
            "May be easy to use and some prices are great! But some charges are hidden and when they say they can't use your card as payment but end up charging you a fee for services they cannot provide this turned me off and is beyond wrong! If I'm paying for something I expect something and I don't pay for something with no product. I ordered a few times but after I was charged for services not rendered I will not order from wish again!!! I don't pay for nothing and I pray you won't either!!!",
            "This app is getting better and better but the pickup nearby system is in need of much improvement! If you forget to pick something up on the exact date or something happens which makes you unable to pick it up on that date you get a partial refund and no product because the store doesn't know what's in the packages and can't scan it for you anymore! So the store is left with products they can't deliver and the costumer has to reorder the product or is simply left empty handed. CS is sh*'t too..",
            "Updated \"blitz buy\" is BROKEN. I don't know what they did, but the new Blitz Buy is constantly crashing and not working.... Maybe y'all can call it \"glitch buy\" because it glitches more than it actually works. Other than that, I've found some unique gifts and good prices. You just have to watch the cost of shipping in order to decide whether the price is \"good\" or not.",
            "Love everything except that the promos they offer always sound better than they are. It's always like \"save up to 90%\" but then it's only 5% off. Also the shipping is worded in a way that makes it sound like it's going to be quicker than it is. BUT the prices are low low and the product selection is HUGE!! so the issues are not too important. I love wish!"

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",
            "Used to be fun and my favorite time passer. Now it's just so overwhelming buggy and full of ads. The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",
            "The ads freeze so the game must be closed and reopened. This happens after every turn and your version of ad-free is a $10/mo subscription? If there's a cheap, one-time, ad-free purchase....I'm not seeing it. Fix this please. I'd be more than willing to pay a very small one-time fee to just remove ads.",
            "I cannot view the ads to gain more coins, BUT am over run with ads after each move. Some dont finish, so close game. Have repeatedly complained to no effect. Will not buy coins for power ups! People complain about creeps lurking - don't answer them, then when finished game, block them. Turn volume off to block loud music or noise."

            "I really haven't played it long enough to judge how good it is. I'll need a little longer. Now that I've played more I really enjoy the the variety of games. I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",

Lucky to have such a great game. I play every day. Hard to stop. Incredible. Excellent. Fun. wonderful. Fun. FUN. Swell. T",
            "Fun game but glitchy. More often than not, when I attempt to access the \"Winner's Club\" screen, I'm greeted with the message, \"Sorry. There is a temporary issue with Winner's Club. Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

            "It's a very nice game and I enjoy it very much, I would have given it five stars but the problem is the fuel runs out very fast and also the passengers and the roads are the same please work on that it's really boring carrying the same passengers through the same roads, and also the view keeps changing itself every time I reload on fuel or when I pick up the passengers. Either than that it's really a good game 😘😍😘😍😘",

This game is one of the most annoying games I have ever come across. This game seems to be a very interesting game but when I try to play, it starts to fool. Please do something about it because I cannot just waste my bundle to achieve nothing. I'm very bored today because of this game.",

When we this game the graphics and background are merging and the people in the game they are also merge with each other and their is no so long and hard level but when we go to full the tank of petrol we have to give some many money 💰. I don't like this game very much. I will give only 2stars Thank you!",
            "From all rickshaw game this is the best game as campare to other Rickshaw game. I like this game. Just one thing there is problem that when you win all the levels there is no things to do with this game and you have to unistall this game. So I want to give some improvement that if you make the endless game then it's good and also improve your graphics. Graphics are not good",
            "The petrol gets finished very soon. And the driver says the same line \" I Come as soon as possible\" and I noticed that the auto do not have the excess to airport , garage , railway stations etc. And another thing I Noticed that the game is different from the pics given in the discription . But I liked the multiplayer mode."

            "I've redownload this game on different phones over the years and do really enjoy the game. But one issue seems consistent despite the device. Maybe it's because I have little fingers but the movements aren't always accurate and it gets really frustrating when you get to higher speeds. I try to slide over and end up jumping instead. Or flat out don't move at all and go splat into the train I was trying to avoid in the first place. It's fun and a good game but the tolerances need to be better.",
            "I haven't played this game for a very long time, but after reinstalling it again recently, all I can say is... Good job on this masterpiece! Seriously, this game is better than I remember! The only reason I vote it for 4 stars is because there are ads popping up on the home screen. Other than that, keep up the good work! 🙌🏼",
            "Amazing game, one of the \"originals\"- I remember when everyone I knew had this game- and it's continued to develop amazingly! One idea though, would be an option to change the theme, as I, personally, prefer to other themes than the current (Halloween) one. This would be a really nice thing to see added, but still a great game either way! Thank you!",
            "I understand why ads are necessary but what I hate about is the \"UnityAds\" are always crashing my game and it automatically closing the game. \"Google Ads\" are better, it does not crash my game. Still 3 stars for now. Hope you removed all the \"Unity Ads\" in the app. It spoils my experiences in the game. Reported this issue already to your support team. Still waiting for a response. Please? Thank you.",
            "I liked this game very much...✌🏻It's amazing😍👍🏻It's features are also too good 👍🏻✌🏻But one ☝thing I doesn't like is that, that when I am playing my 🎮game the, \"Unity Ads\" Crash/stop 🙅my 🎮game... The other ads like goggle ads are good then unity ads... because they doesn't stop/crash my 🎮game... I hope that you will remove unity ads.. Plz reply about this.... Thank You for reading my post..."

            "It's a great and helpful app. I only have two complaints: 1. It should be easier to organise your list. I want to put the titles in a custom order, because sorting by rating puts them in wrong order due to multiple titles having the same rating. I also think the lists should instantly update when you give a new rating, now I have to wait a while before my list gets updated",
            "I have never had such a great, useful, dependable, easy to use, informative, and valuable app. Valuable I have won a few bucks having IDBM as my personal bet settler. You should try it, you won't regret it. I continue to explore this app and find more things I can do with it. I really can't say enough about my IMBD app",
            "Best app ever for film or TV lovers. Truthfully use this app multiple times a day, loads over an average week. Amazing for those \"what have I seen him/her in before\" moments; also those \"who the hell dat\" moments. Also settles many marital disputes for couples that watch a lot together. Great for watching suggestions and I especially like the Prime recommendations as a Prime user. Trailers are also useful. Goofs are funny to watch out for, location & OST details Great too. Love it - thank you.",
            "I really like this app. I can watch tv shows and movies for free. I have read several reviews about problems playing trailers or anything. I have not experienced any of these issues. Everything has played perfectly. I have only been using this app for a little while but its worth having.",
            "Could be a little less glitchy and more user friendly but overall great app. IMDb is the best! Better than Rotten Tomatoes by a mile for sure. I have been using IMDb for twenty years now and they've always proven to be the best in collective information about a movie, celebrity, tv show, etc."

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

            "If you hate being angry, then don't play this game. They made an Impossible game mode called Race. It makes me want to bash my head against the wall. It's impossible to get the Scythe. There are waaay too much ads and some knifes are buggy to use. (When hitting something correctly, it misses!) I don't want to ever download this game ever and I don't recommend it! The game is no longer enjoyable.",
            "It's either that the game hates me or I'm bad because I'm disabled in the hands. when I try to do the combo it always lands on the side or handle, other than that the game is pretty good if ur bored so I think u should get it :)",
            "Excellent, i play this game for hours straight without being bored one single second, it's great and (a little) easy. Incredible and cool game, i like it.",
            "Awsome... But on the good lazer on combo you could make it too where when it's high up in the air the lazer could go inside of the handle also i have recomened your game to all of my friends cause you made an awsome game!",
            "This game is actually really good. I'm not the type of person to like these games but this one I really liked. One thing though... There is a badge where u need to jump 3 platforms. But in that gamemode it won't let me. If I go off screen I will automatically die. Anything you guys can do?"

            "I really like this game. I will still play it. But I really dislike the new art style. It feels cheaper in my opinion. I have not heard the sound design yet (been playing with volume off) but I hope its the same as before. That is my real only complaint. If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

            "I enjoy this game. This is a strategy game. The story is well designed and the plot moves at a steady but adequate rate. The resources, and other helps are well placed and the player is able to build buildings, troops, and other items in a timely manner. If you are looking for a game that is fun and offers a challenge...try War and Magic: Kingdom Reborn.",
            "Right, so it's telling me to leave my city in the tutorial, you know, the VERY annoying feature of the game that doesn't allow you to do anything else or click on anything else until I do what the game wants you to do... Yeah, I can't leave my city until level 9, but I can't get to level 9 until I finish the tutorial, but to continue with the tutorial, I have to leave the city. How do you expect me to play the game if I can't do anything with the game? MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!",
            "This game is a marvelous experience. Your not bombarded with sales and no pay to play. I highly recommend this to first time players. Advancement is possible and achievable without major purchases. Well done!",
            "This game is indepth a f different. That make is fun and not boring. Lots of rewards, have had to buy a package yet. And still growing fast. Thy it you will like",
            "You know a game is bad when it has flashing 'buy' icons all over it. Also it has little to no real strategy involved. Annoying 'do this build this upgrade this' like literally every other generic game of the same type."

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!☺",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

            "Zedge is an awesome application for the customization of your ringtones and notification sounds. It has an incredible selection of wallpapers but I wouldn't say that's the star quality of this app but when it comes down to customizing ringtones and notification sounds... I haven't searched for a notification, alarm, or ringtone that Zedge didn't have, or a supplemental sound that sounds just as good if not better!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! I don't think I will ever use another software/program!!",
            "I love it . But they don't have \"WHAT'S UP\" . They used to. I had it as my friends ring tone and somehow I lost it. I have been trying and trying to find it again, to no avail . All I could find is these stupid whistle songs. I really want the loud \"WHAT'S UP \" I believe it came from a Budweiser commercial. My friend says it all the time. I am hard of hearing so I need a really loud ring tone. Otherwise it's a great app.",
            "Went downhill. Can't find download files for live wallpaper and mandatory 30 sec ads to download each wallpaper, and then not being able to find it. And they even include a little useless chat bubble that says it's stored in internal storage > data but it's not there (and the article they link you to is useless too!) 🙃🙃 Honestly I have this app cause I've used it for over 5+ years but yikes it sucks now.",
            "Mediocre! It used to work perfectly, no problems. But recently when I allocate a ringtone to either my phone or a contact it works for a short time, then reverts back to the default phone ringtone. When I try to reallocate the ringtone in the app, it states, 'Something went wrong'. I initially paid the £3.99 thinking this may fix the issue, but no luck. Cancelled the prescription immediately. Only get this app if you like getting ignored by the app developers, as I've still not had any response.",
            "I like the Zedge app's massive amount of ringtones, notifications, and wallpapers to choose from, but I don't think this app has enough different categories of smartphone customizing features available. I think this app, it's developers, and it's users would all benefit greatly from a few theme customization options to download, for example, there could be an in-app option that allows the user to create their own custom app themes, custom text fonts, and a customized wallpaper creator."

            "I'm a 14 year old cyclist, I started about a month ago and fell in love, the more you use strava the easier it will get, I'm paying £5.00 a month for extra uses such as building routes and seeing you heart rate, analize each effort, power zones, segment leader boreds so people can see you if you are in top 10 for a surten road, I highly reccoment getting this app!",
            "I like the metrics, but the reason I got the app was to be able to notify my family of when I was out running. Having to send a text then start the app is not as smooth as I would like. An automatic notification to them when I start the routine is what was expected. I sent the beacon notification thinking that was the start of my run and didn't realize till I was 0.5mile in that my workout had started. One of my best runs was not clocked. Even worse, I opened a ticket a month ago on this. 😒",
            "Every time I pause a recording during a run, it glitches and records inaccurate kms and a crazy fast pace. That it happens repeatedly is unacceptable. Strava should ensure the basic functionalities are working before removing free features and constantly advertising for their paid subscription. Will be looking elsewhere now.",
            "A good app. Cost is a bit high. Also, there needs to be a way to incriminate the ride to find the highest 1 hour max, ideally automatically. This should be easy programming. I usually just take my avg power for the whole ride as my FTP, if it improves. Also, I'm sorry STRAVA but, I want the ability to turn off the local legends option. Or at least rename the idea. A local legends should be someone with the most KOMs. Please these improvements so I can 5 star you guys! Kris",
            "It's a good app, but either the app, my phone (Xperia xz1 compact) or my global location (West Sussex, UK) conspire to formulate GPS data that is not accurate enough to trust. It congratulated me for running 400metres in 44 seconds and tracked two identical runs on different days as 1.6km different in length."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",

            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything.

Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",

The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

            "Upgrade? More like a serious downgrade. Played this faithfully for years every day. Not enjoyable when the scores are predetermined before the game even begins. Epic failure on this ridiculous update to try and get consumers to buy more upgrades to still consistently lose. 10/31/20 so now the game won't even load. I've uninstalled, reinstalled ect and nothing. So I've lost 3 freebies for watching the same crappy ad and my 2 spins as well as possible coins depending on where I ranked.",
            "Please release a seperate scoring system & leader board for \"no power-ups used\" I'd have rated the game higher if it was included. I'd play every single tournament if you included this. Tournaments could be played twice if this was a feature when you have got enough power-ups, competing against friends & the league without them... then again with them. Go back & improve on levels with or without using them. As it is daily play isn't really an option. Entering every tournament isn't either",
            "I have bought items to play this game because it usually is a fun game to play. But when it is the Angry Bird video I am watching causes the game to crash and it unjustly ends my streak, and I lose all of the money I spent to get higher scores, then you have lost me as a fan and a financial supporter of the game! The other notable item is that they don't have custom support because they give ZERO about the customers!",
            "Well this game used to cheat in diamond league before but now it is great when I get to be in first in diamond league so I do not want to talk negatively about this game. In the new update some things have been changed but I still do not like one thing about this game that the matches in the Streaks have started to cheat.",
            "CUP CHALLENGE IS REDICULOUS NOW..!!! Not worth playing as it's unbalanced as far as fair matches go, and main game is terrible and glitches since last update and new round in game..! WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE..? Please fix..!!! Also, backgrounds in game make it hard to see certain targets...! To busy, to cluttered...!!! Needs major improvement, simple is sometimes the best..!"

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I gave it four stars because it gives videos yes but it doesn't give it in all the levels. Because in level 14 and 20 I got videos but I looked down and I never see anymore so I was thinking that it wasn't so bad that's why I gave it four stars and that's not all when I turn on my internet connection again it started to freeze up horbley",
            "It's an okay game. Too easy for adults but I'd say inappropriate for children since there's bdsm subjects. Graphics aren't amazing and there are indeed some ads but if you're looking for a time killer game this is it. It's as advertised, and good enough for 3 stars",
            "I got up to the last board, then even though I was doing everything right the game wouldn't let me go on and win. It just froze and that's it. So frustrating. So now I'm boycotting every game from the maker"

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "Give it a shot; learn whether you like shiny collecting, PvP battling, or raiding with new friends, it's all fun. To be honest, the game has some issues and connectivity problems here and there. Not every part of it works all the time, and you pretty much will subtly need to become a pay-to-player, since the game works best with some financial investment. However, by far my favorite mobile game for a while now. Always keeps you engaged in new content and exciting events👌",
            "Im trying to start a new account since I can't recover my account from when I started the game back when it came out.. but every time I get started I get to the point where the professor tells you to catch your first Pokémon and it glitches and will not let me what so ever try to catch it no matter what I do and then refuses to open after. I have deleted and re-download 3 times and the same problem everytime. I guess I just won't play.",
            "This is a beautiful game. It is free to play and in the past 2 years I have spent approximately $60 on it. Taking into consideration the amount of time I've spent playing it and how interactive it is, it is well worth the money I've spent on coins for incubators, pokéballs, and other important items. As a follower of all things pokemon for the past 20 years, this is fire.",
            "It was very good until adventure sync stopped working, I have it on in my pocket while I move about 10km a day 5 days a week and my eggs barely get even 0.1km, this really needs to be fixed soon and I will update my review. Plus the prices keep going up for everything in the shop, which is kind of annoying being digital purchases shouldn't really change in value, it's hard enough with covid19 having everything else go up in price but now this game is too?",
            "With the new updates come the weak connection issue (again) in battle league. They promised to fix it in next update, but now its getting worse. They also implemented some new battle display (zoom in/out when trainer throwing ball and erased switching pokemon button) without announcement beforehand, so it's completely ruined our habits in battle."

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "I played for a few months, then every time I tried to open it, it would crash. I uninstalled and installed it again because it's a laid back game with good graphics and great animals. Now after about a month since then, the option to watch videos (it lets you do this every 24 hrs) is no longer working. It costs waaaay too much to expand the zoo and you don't get enough coins from shops and animals to do it just from those. Plus you are rewarded nothing for leveling up. I was enjoying it again.",
            "I am enjoying this game, although I've only just started, I am finding that there is not enough information on how to play, it is fairly straightforward I can't find how to get my animals out of the box, where they were put as I didn't have enough room on my reserve, I had to find out by accident how to even expand my reserve, if I new all this playing would be a better experience, I do love driving my jeep to capture animals, I will keep playing see if I can figure out some more things.",
            "I have started this game on Google pass. You get free money and you play without ads. Its kind of boring but ok game. But today I got in game ads all the time. Free money dissapeared. Really slow to play now :(((. I dont know how to contact google pass to report this problem. I will be uninstalling if not fixed. Edit. They fixed it. I am ok playing it sometimes",
            "I liked this game in the beginning, it was easy to get money watching ads and buying new animals, but the problem is expanding the zoo costs more and more every time! . Please can you fix it so I can play it again. But its still a nice game to play when I have free time :)",
            "Awesome game.. I love the fact that you need to rescue the animals yourself from different habitats to care for them in the zoo and even release them but the amount of money it takes to buy ANYTHING is ridiculous. Edit:: found a section in the store, for every 3 videos watched, you get 7500 gold. Not sure if it's there permanently or every once in a while but it definitely makes me happy."

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "So I loved this game and I paid for no ads, and got all the monsters. But yet I guess now that I'm towards the \"end\" I have to watch an ad to play. No problem but 1. I paid for no ads. None. And I can't watch the ad to play your game. It keeps saying there's no video available, try again later and freezes. So over all. Love the actual game and game play, but don't waste your money and be fully prepared to not be able to move forward in the game. I got to 77, I passed. I can't play the other 3.",
            "My daughter loved this game but since she got to level 61, she can't revive. If she does, the character moves but the screen doesn't move with her. She also is having a problem with the repair alphabet rooms. She's on room F, has done everything, but it won't reward her or unlock the next room. Gutting for a 6 year old. I think she's finished the game, she's just replaying some levels now.",
            "I love this game, but as soon as I tried to paint on room 2 everything froze, I tried turning my phone on and off, closing the game... nothing worked! It might of been a virus but I'm not sure, I loved this game so much and ended up having to uninstall it then reinstall. I have had to start ALL OVER AGAIN 😠😠😠 That is why I have to give it a three out of five, sorry! It is a really fun game though.",
            "I originally had this game on an Amazon tablet where the ads are contained. After upgrading my son's tablet to a more powerful android device I re-download this. This game is flooded with microtranaction and ads even after paying the 2 dollars to \"remove ads\". What this $2 doesn't include is the need to watch 30s ads for each level after level 16 everytime you play a lvl. This is false advertisement and dishonesty around paying $2 to \"remove ads\". DO NOT download for your kids. I want my $2 back",
            "I give this game a 1 out five because everytime I try to play the game it kicks me out I haven't evan got to see if the game was nice cause it kicks me out . I don't recommend this game for anyone, it just takes up space that you can use for another app that actually works!!.very bad quality, very bad game!!!!!!!!!"

            "when I first downloaded this game it was good ....playable even with the adds you could skip around ...but now it's worthless ....they make you watch at least 8 to 10 seconds of adds each and every time your game concludes weather or not you have advanced ....it wouldn't be so bad if you did make another level but when you're stuck on one the last thing you need is to wait for a damn add for another game!!!I personally I think they have f**ked this game up all to hell",
            "Good game, i would give this bad boy 5 stars but for some reason the projectile that comes out of the gun has brass attached still. Other than that. Its a sweet game",
            "I'm awake! Just thought I would try this game, man, I hope you try so you can feel what I feel right now. Excitement is all around you, the enemy is too, get the rusty ole rifle and pick a spot, the action is swift and the ship is moving. Try this game and you will be moving too! Or ? Get moving sniper, lock & load!",
            "After level 400 it's almost impossible to continue except you spent a lot of money for Dia to remove the unrealistic wind effect every time. Upgrades like guns, bullets and so on are not more than a kind of a placebo. Try yourself and compare it by playing a minigame using different stuff. I have fired more than 50k real bullets up to distances of 300 meters in my life and even in hard wind. I never experienced such a wind effect, not a 2 ms and not at 4 ms not even with a muzzle loader rifle.",
            "Ads galore!! When will the mobile gaming market move out of this sleazy, cheap practice of freemium games, and move onto the next era like with demos, then buy the game of you like it? No darn ads... UDATE: Spent coin on an upgrade, then next time I went in, the upgrade was not available. It was like I never bought it! And I lost all that coin too! No way would I put real money into this game."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

Loved the backstory and graphics, including the CGI animation. Good work on how the evidence board was compiled to move the story along with the prisoner, nothing was boring. Nice puzzles and hidden object scenes. Had fun, keep'em coming.",

            "I haven't been able to use the app. It tells me no, every single time I try and set a profile picture, so I can actually start matching. Near every single one I've tried, break no guideline rules, and the ones that *technically* do, I've seen other people with the exact same rule break (for example, the \"no obstructing your face\" rule, I thought the Snapchat dog face filter would be caught by that, but I've seen 5+ people with it on their profile picture just fine). Won't even tell me the issue.",
            "I like this app. Straight to the point. Although the only interaction you can have for a male seems to be to pay after she contacts you. Alit of these apos or sites incthe past would run a bot system to time out random convetsation to make it seemclike they liked you. Only to find out they were shady sites fishing for pics so they could run them somewhete else. I cant stand trash developers or dishonesty when it comes to peoples money and feelings. Ill say 3 and get back to you",
            "I used to be able to log on anywhere. Now it only let's me when im using wi fi. Its not my service. Everything else works. Its a great app when it works.",
            "Surprisingly decent free app. I've got seemingly real matches who are genuinely interested in relationships. This app hasn't yet bugged me for premium, and I've found several people nearby who are real. The only complaint I have is that since, my internet cuts out occasionally, I'm unable to use the messaging function until it's back up. Maybe consider a data supportive messaging system. It's not too big a deal though.",
            "Terrible. Someone needs to fixvthe algorithms or something. It constantly says prople are nearby, or even with the state- and they are literally sitting in a cave with Borat, in Kazakhstan. Smh."

It would be awesome if you added a male character called... Musa. Hope you do another series and add the character Musa.",

            "This game is so nice and I love it, but I have two problems. First, Game Shakers should do a new place after Groovetopia, because it is so easy just to go to Groovetopia. Second, this game started to be so boring, first days you play it you will like a lot, but then it will be boring. I hope Game Shakers would solve these problems.",

            "I enjoyed it alot, but I finished it really quickly. I loves it so much tho. I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"
