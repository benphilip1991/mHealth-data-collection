            "Good. Ads are so minimal on the free version which is refreshing. Sometimes I find the instructions don't make sense, so you have to pause and think. But I suppose that's good because we are training our brains to get better. I'm using this because I had a brain tumour removed and I'm trying to get my cognitive abilities back. Using this gives me a great sense of accomplishment, and benchmarks for areas of improvement",
            "Great! Some problems/concerns: - time to read a task description should not be counted - better to not just choose a random exercises, but consider what a user was working on recently, cuz sometimes the app gives me the same one multiple times in a row - more statistics, please, so that I can track day to day progress - more exercises? Premium should help, but still",
            "So as others have already stated...why does the timer countdown when you are reading how to do the different brain exercises. That is not fair at all. If I'm new and learning how to play them for the first time the timer shld not start....and you should have a 30-60second to learn how to play it before jumping right into the exercise. Other than that I love the exercises and I'll keep training my üß†.",
            "Great little brain games that I'm hoping will really make a difference in my brain strength over time! Lol. Only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I could be doing better on the game's if we had more clear instructions for Each game provided to us. Like Examples of exactly how.to do each game would be Great! üëåüèΩüòÅ",
            "Just what I needed! Beautifully designed app! I'm trying to improve my executive functioning because of what I think is the \"COVID Long Haul\" brain fog & forgetfullness. I also have ADHD & PTSD. This app is engaging like a game but not so addictive that it takes over my brain when I have something else I NEED to do. If it proves to have longer term benefits I will try to update this review. üòä"

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "Well, there are hundreds of advertisements which are displayed after 2 seconds! They are quite annoying. So, I didn't give 1 star. And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ‚ùé. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",
            "Very fun, and entertaining!! :) You will be asked questions, they will seem almost impossible. But theres this Light Bulb you can click that gives you a hint. Sometimes you can answer. You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",
            "I love this game. It's interesting and good for time pass. So many people are saying in reviews that this app shows ads alot. For those people, I just want to say one thing 'Why don't you guys switch off your mobile data while playing this game?' Solution of your problem is too easy.",
            "This game is just like the rest and not that fun and you get to a question that looks like you should give you own answer, what rating would you give this game and the only one that is \"correct\" is the one that says full marks and then tries to make it seem like you wanted to pick that.... No. Just no."

            "It's a really good and tricky game. Makes you think really hard. It's also really interactively funny. I love it. It's not dull and the puzzles are really fun and the music too. Thank you devs for giving us such a good thinking game üëçüèΩ",
            "So far I love this app! Fun and challenging. But some of the solutions given aren't optimal: #30) If you turn it upside down you can make a number that is higher than the solution. #49) The solution given would be correct if some of the choices had the word \"only\", but they do not. As it stands there are two correct solutions, but neither of them are the stated solution.",
            "I love it. Now im giving it 5 stars but the clues could be a little more helpful. Other than that its a GREAT game!!",
            "Nice puzzles, some are very out the box thinking that a normal person would not consider. When thinking of a solution, don't allow traditional limitations stop you from coming up with a solution. Such as screen orientation, size of screen, and visible screen options. As well, common sense is typically the best option to use."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

You can't be brave, innovative, creative or a leader without vulnerability. It is not a negative, it is a necessity and asset. As someone going into the field of emotional research, I can tell you THAT is what the science says.",

            "This is a pretty good app that is continuously improving. There are still some bugs that need worked out, and I wish there was a system for reporting these. For example, the self-regulate exercise doesn't allow me to adjust the 1-10 scales. Also, the positive affirmations exercise never seems to complete, and I can never get progress points for it.",

It was through the survey panel named Attapoll for the amount of $1.04! Please resolve this!",

Also when the time starts ticking, there's not enough time to hurry up. Don't get me wrong, it is a great app but the little things add up. At last I must say there are a few unique concepts worth trying!",

I love the art style and the training is fun and useful) the only thing is for me, the yoga instructor game is too fast, but I guess I just need practice, is all. Thank you for this game, with such beautiful colours and art style!"

There are dead links in the sign up process, pages don't display properly on Galaxy S9. And to cap it all off the first question in the sports quiz was asking what country Manny Pacquiao is from and the options were 'Evander', 'Don' or 'Walt'. None of which are countries...

The tournaments are based on popular topics that starts off with easy questions that get more difficult as you move to the end. You can also challenge your friends to one-on-one challenges.

It would also help if there where course specific options to focus the questions more.

However, for what it is, it is a good app and I would recommend.",

            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5üåüs thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",
            "I freaking love it. A bit heavy on the ads but hey, it's free. You can at least watch an ad to get another life once you run out. I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

With the help of this app, you can:\r\n\r\n-Relax and calm your mind with relaxation music.\r\n\r\n-Aid your study sessions with calm study music.\r\n\r\n-Meditate calmly with meditation music.\r\n\r\n-Much More..\r\n\r\nThere are 5 types of binaural beats and these are the main features of it:\r\n\r\nDelta Waves: Sleep\r\nTheta Waves: Deep Meditation\r\nAlpha Waves: Relaxation\r\nBeta Waves: Concentration and Cognition\r\nGamma Waves: Intelligence and Memory\r\n\r\nYou don't have to worry of frequency settings and technical sections because we have arranged the binaural beats according to their effects on the human brain.\r\n\r\nThe science of binaural beat is really simple. One sound frequency in one ear, and another sound frequency in the opposite ear, creating a two-tone effect in the mid-brain that is actually perceived to be one tone. This causes an \"Entrainment \" effect in the brain that has a variety of results including relaxation, reduced anxiety, memory recall, increased intelligence (long-term) etc.\r\n\r\nHere are some official scientific researches on binaural beats:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233742/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487409/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165862/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995205/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222722\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428073/\r\n\r\nSpecial Note: Always wear earphones or headphones while listening to binaural beats to enjoy highest effectiveness.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nQ1. What should my pose be during listening to these tracks? and volume ? and earphones?\r\n\r\nAns: You can just do your work (any work) and listen to these beats simultaneously. But if you be seated at one place and listen it in a 'meditation pose', it will increase its effectiveness. This applies to all the music.\r\n\r\n70% volume.\r\n\r\nRegarding earphones, you can use any earphone or headphone you like. Binaural beats works in any and every earphone or big headphones.\r\n\r\nQ2. What is the duration limit per day?\r\n\r\nAns: You can listen to any beat for 10 minutes. 10 Minutes is actually more than enough for each class of music. But if you have free time, then you can listen to one beat continuously for 3 times. 30 Minutes is the general limit. You should not listen to each beat continuously for more than 3 times i.e 10√ó3= 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nQ3. Can I hear all beats one by one?\r\n\r\nAns: If you want, you can listen to another music after 1 hr after listening to any music. Gap can be 1 hr between every track. Its so because your mind should have enough time to process each beat effectively.\r\n\r\nQ4. What is the best time to listen to these tracks?\r\n\r\nAns: Anytime! You can listen to these tracks anytime, anywhere you want. But as the fact is, morning is the best time to listen to the binaural beats. Morning is a divine time, so you would be able to connect more to yourself spiritually.\r\n\r\nQ.5 How much time will it take to feel the results?\r\n\r\nAns: It depends! Everyone's mind structure is different. But if you listen any music for 10 minutes (according to your goal) every day without any skip day, then you should start feeling the results after 3 to 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nQ6. I am a student, which beat is best for me?\r\n\r\nAns: Study music is specially made for students and you should listen to it if you are a student. During night hours, you can listen to relaxation music to relax your mind so that your mind works at its best the next day.\r\n\r\nBuy Ultimate Mind Booster and provide us your feedback in the feedback section!\r\n\r\nWish you a happy and a healthy life.",

            "So.... who else is playing my screen on my phone? I don't play when I'm at work; come home to find puzzles completed and/or bonus points used. Even if I come back after a couple hours, I find this. On my iPad and computer version this does not occur. I never take part in tournaments, and never opted for a group game, if there is such a thing. And, like others, why don't we get the bonus points we used to?",
            "Used to be fun. Used to be good. Latest update now shoves points when you get 1 bonus word, then again at 3 bonus words again at 10 bonus words. This \"forcing\" of the points I to the total early instead of at the end of the game ( like it USED TO BE DONE) causes the game to hang while it \"thinks\" about forcing points plus it disables the ability to swipe letters while it is \"thinking\". This new change SUCKS.",
            "I am not at all happy with the latest update! As a matter of fact, it really sucks now because i'm not getting the same amount of points per word as i used to with the previous update guys! Please rectify the situation or i will be uninstalling this game, as i am certain that many other players have done so already or are going to do so, if you guys don't go back to the previous update, as it was, before you went & messed it all up for myself & many others before me! Okay?",
            "This game is, to use an overused term, \"addictive\". If so, at least it's a pleasant one! So far, so good. I hope getting the $ in it's usable form works out positively. If not...!",
            "Don't like the new update. When I installed this app I paid to have no adverts. Since the update I'm getting ads. Apparently nobody is interested in getting this corrected. This is one of my favourite apps but uninstalling."

            "I loved these varied and exceptionally challenging math puzzles. The hints provided were helpful, but were not so obvious as to give away the answer without serious thought. You really have to think outside the box; nonlinear thought is required to figure out the underlying pattern. Once you identify the pattern, it is then straightforward to solve the puzzle.",
            "Enjoyable and a bit challenging at times. There were a couple of problems that weren't clear how you were supposed to know to use a certain number as a reference. The clearest form of this was on one of the questions, the hint was \" - 40\". I dont know how I was supposed to know to subtract each answer from 40. It just seemed like an arbitrary number that you had to use the hint to know. Other than those questions, which there were only a few, I really enjoyed using this app.",
            "Good for getting basic math practice in from what I am able to play. Unfortunately I am stuck on a level that requires multiple entries and will not allow multiple entries. I had the right answer, but could not enter it. Very frustrating. Maybe a quick tutorial on the various ways you may have to enter answers would fix this. I probably could figure it out if it isn't a bug, but there are millions of games out there. This just turned me off. Next!",
            "Made me recall the simple rules like pemdas, also adding some \"additional\" rules to solve levels as they progress; many answers based on correlation of number sets. Being dyslexic, this game is/was very empowering for me, as I started out sailing through without having to write anything down to solve any of the puzzles. However, after I got stuck on level 58 (by coincidence) my shrink lowered my adderall dose and now I can't make it past level 30 without working the problems on paper. :(",
            "Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult, but none are too difficult that they can't be completed with a little math knowledge and a bit of outside-the-box thinking. Overall, I enjoyed this app, and completing it is a good brain exercise. Some of the puzzles don't actually require math to solve, which annoyed me at first, but after doing a few I thought it was good to force my brain to think more outside the box than just simply looking for a mathematical pattern. Pretty darn good app."

        "description": "In IQ Test - Intelligence Test, we have made multiple IQ tests for you to measure different aspects of your IQ as you'd like. The IQ tests that are available are:\r\n\r\n1) Emotional IQ: Measures your emotional spectrum\r\n2) Logical IQ: Measures logical intelligence and how well you could use your logic to solve problems, patterns\r\n3) Quantitative IQ: In this test, you will measure your analytical and mathematical abilities\r\n4) Memory test: Memorize the sequence of numbers & letters to guess them correctly!\r\n\r\nIQ score is an interesting and important concept to measure. Knowing your IQ will allow you to know a lot of who you are, your intelligence, and which areas of your mind you should improve.\r\n\r\nWe have also added a brain teaser section named under (MYSTERY TEST). This test is a unique, interesting, and fun IQ test in which you have to answer all questions correctly to pass it!\r\n\r\nResults & Detailed Results of IQ test - Intelligence Test\r\n- We have added simple and comprehensive results regarding your IQ score range. The detailed results include your strengths, weaknesses, celebrity types, and much more!\r\n- The simple IQ test results show you a range of your IQ and a calculation of whether you are average, above average, or a genius!\r\n\r\nObjective of IQ tests: IQ is a concept that is used to measure some defined skills of people. The IQ ranking is made from a relative point of view. In other words, some variables are used and then an intelligence test is made. This intelligence test is made in a way that measures the IQ of a person in those areas. It is very difficult to make an IQ test that truly takes a person's absolute true intelligence. However, by taking a common statistic (for example language, or counting), we can make an IQ test that measures people's intelligence. Scientists approach IQ measuring tests in a similar way.

The music creates such atmosphere like........wow! I hope u all would consider this. Love u all!!! Thanks for being there!!",

            "As the old saying goes \"don't fix it if it ain't broke\". Previously, users were able to choose where to save an article, now the article is automatically saved to the list \"Saved\". Now, if users want to circumvent such automatic saving, you added the options \"Add to another...\", \"Move from...\" and \"Remove from...\" --- problem with that is that these options COULD ALL BE TRIVIALIZED if the previous system was still in place.",
            "After using wikipedia app for about 2 years, I've been encountered some problem,first when you want to read the article that has been saved,sometimes it doesn't load at all,and tell me that i do not connected to the internet even though i already downloaded it,two when it successfully load the page there are some photos that's not loaded,so i don't really know the context of the description of the pictures",
            "Love this app, love wikipedia. Far better than searching Wikipedia articles in a browser on mobile. It's easy to use and the in-page seach function is particularly useful, as well as the quick introduction pieces you would normally only be able to access by hovering over a link on a PC or laptop. The quick edits are pretty good, if I'm bored I might steamroller through a couple of image captions or article descriptions. I also enjoy reading the main page in the morning.",
            "Five stars when the many bugs in the latest version (as of 2020-10-29) are corrected. A pleasure to browse, when working! For now, though: üî∏ I've tested on several devices. The 'loading' animation is endless, and the first paragraph or more is missing. Also, it's now hard to get to History.",
            "Wikipedia is the best thing on the internet. Keep this app on your phone and you will benifit from it. App layout is very nice and clean. Articles can be saved offline and synched across devices. You can customize font size, page color and change language of article."

            "I love the game but getting coins is nearly impossible. Sorry, I don't pay to play free games. Pretty ridiculous. Yes, I would like to see more options to gain coins other than spending money. Plus, for coins being so hard to acquire there sure are a lot of ads! Other than that, I do like the small amount of time ( because coins run out) I get to play",
            "The ads are out of control. Seriously. I tried the game for less than 5 minutes. I had to uninstall. The amount of ads (15 seconds of trivia for 25+ seconds of ads) is just way too much. I didn't even get to play long enough to see if I would WANT to purchase no ads. As it stands now, I would absolutely NOT pay money for this. Very bare bones trivia highlighted by greedy ad behavior.",
            "I'm really enjoying this game, and don't understand some of the main complaints about it? 1) if ads are annoying you, you can turn off your data/WiFi and play offline, it works perfectly and no ads! 2) saw some complaints about having to pay for extra gems and coins, but for me there's always an option to earn more by watching (unlimited) ads, if you don't want to spend any money. Perhaps this was a recent update? this game is really addictive and fun.",
            "Great game. Very addictive. I'm loving it a lot. Update: Okay now that I've had the chance to play this game for a bit I can see that its a racket. You can't earn gems and you die after just one wrong answer and have to pay in order not to lose your progress. Yeah you do get one free life on occasion but that's a gimmick to get you to play more and spend more. Its a shame because I like this game and it could be a good game if it wasn't all about making money.",
            "Prepare to spend and spend and spend!!! One wrong answer and you need to pay! Constant bombardment of ads or you can pay, pay, pay. Far too expensive for a mediocre product. Pictures you need to identify are tiny and impossibly to see on a 5\" phone screen so be prepared to pay if you can't make it what is in the image (30 second timer runs out and you fail). This Game is very expensive compared to other similar games."

        "description": "Take the iq test and check visual spatial abilities of your brain. IQ tests train logical reasoning skills, increase counting speed and develop intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe app presents the visual spatial iq test by Hans Eysenck, aimed at identifying specific abilities that can not be determined using general iq tests.\r\n\r\nTo quantify the level of intelligence, psychologists have introduced the concept of IQ - intelligence quotient. The iq test is any test that assesses the level of mental development. Typically, tasks in such tests are distributed by level of complexity, each of which is standardized. Practicing on different types of tests and teaching your brain to different types of questions, you get a real opportunity to increase your iq by several positions.\r\n\r\nWhile taking iq quiz, you can skip questions and return to them at the end of the iq quiz. After you pass the iq quiz, the correct answers will be available to you with the analysis of the results. You can share the result with friends and call them to take the iq quiz.\r\n\r\nYou have 30 minutes to finish the brain test. Do not think too long on one logic question. Perhaps you are on the wrong track and it is better to move on to the next question. But do not give up too quickly, because most logic questions are can be solved if your brain shows a little patience. Remember that questions become more difficult by the end of the test. Every person is able to solve part of the proposed logic questions, but no one is able to cope with all the questions of this brain test in half an hour.\r\n\r\nIQ test does not contain tricky logic questions, but you always have to consider several solutions. Before proceeding, make sure that you understand the condition of the task correctly. You will waste your time if you take up a decision without understanding what the question is about.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no intelligence test assessing can be considered universal, each iq test is only suitable for a specific category of people. This iq test by Hans Eysenck is intended for literate people between the ages of 18 and 50-60, with an iq slightly higher than average. IQ tests (for assessing intelligence) are subject to the effects of training and education, which, with routine testing, can lead to improved results. Users under the age of 18 and over 55-60 years on average will show lower results than all others when passing this iq test.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for updates.

It offers a free puzzle every day, but very seldom can you actually download that puzzle, or even see it in your available puzzles list. You can watch ads to get Clues, but lately that's been causing the app to crash at times so that you have to restart it. Also, some of the pictures are quite interesting and merit closer study, but as soon as they are revealed they vanish almost instantly.",

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not üòä); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a ¬£iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

            "Good game BUT ads. 30 second ad to start a game. 30 second ad to finish a game. If you minimize this game to check texts or phone, another 30 second ad to resume. So a minimum of one minute in ads. I like the daily challenges but on this game I have not figured out what it takes to win a game. It appears that you have to complete a game about 30 times before it counts as completed. It is an good game if you have a lot of spare time and not much else to do."

            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

I used to love this game. I hope you solve this problem soon.",

            "After selecting ready in a single player game it takes you back to the main menu with no record of the game. Thought it was just a one time fluke but it happened 3 more times. You never know when its going to happen so it's not worth trying for a high score when you could get 20 questions in and it decides to strip the game from you. I used to like this game. Sad.",
            "I've been using this app for the past 5 years now, however recently there have been a lot of issues. Every time I try to connect or play it flashes 'error connecting' or 'unable to load questions'. Even with a stable internet connection. I've uninstalled and installed the app various times, in an endeavour to get rid of this problem but it seems to persist. Please look into the same!",
            "TOO MANY DAMN ADS. I've come back after a while and honestly these awful 'No work but rich' ads are making me quit the game after 5 minutes of playing. I used to play for 2 hours in a day. Now I can't even stand 10 minutes. You got recognition for the game... Remember where you started..."

I have a lot of difficulty playing Block Breaker because I keep hitting a button combination that sends the pad flying to either end of the wall, that combined with the small hit box, makes me miss a lot.",
            "I love this game!!! Its so fun and it gives me energy! But i want something to be added in this game cuz those games in this app is little boring :( I want sport games. Like basketball. Hockey. Football. And castle and base defense game. And more! And i also want a game with full of incredible story! But its hard to find my favourite games in this app. Maybe u can add something like FAVOURITE GAMES BUTTON? And also more incredible brain-struggling question games :D! THANK YOU!!!",
            "I haven't played it yet old games before, but now it seems it was good, not bad at all, some games are not good (I don't personal play it), some games are good (only my favorites). No ads, no pay purchases, and offline (no need internet required online, that's great), it's totally free.",
            "Gave 3 stars because while the games themselves were fun back in the day, it's almost impossible to play them in the format presented here. Games like Brick Breaker, Midnight Bowling, and Midnight Pool are the main ones; the tiny screen you play them on makes it almost impossible to see what's going on. If this game is given the options for touch as well as full screen, I'll change my rating.",
            "I just want to play spiderman unlimited.... That was the BEST GAME EVER. Why the hell did you get rid of it... Please, if you search you will see many people love it... And if it was for profit, then put the game to 4 dollars or something. I would totally buy it without thinking. And many would say the same"

            "It's a good game. A bit slow at first, but once you establish a few outposts the game moves as fast as you want. I enjoy that the tutorial is brief. Ads only happen if you want to make a bit of in-game cash. I would like to know what an upgrade will get me. \"Improved performance\" and \"more crafting options\" doesn't shed much light on what higher level buildings can do. Haven't found uranium yet.",
            "This game is calm and way different from all those moneysucking mobile games. No annoying ads unless you want some extra currency or speed up some progress. It's amazing how much you can do. There's always something new to explore etc. Its only downside is that the gameplay is extremely slow, but it also has its charms: it gives a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the road. Dear developer, if you see this, just know that i love your work and can't wait to see what comes next.",
            "The game is a work in progress and so it has a few bugs and minor issues which do not affect the overall gameplay experience. This game is not marred by paywalls intrusive pop up ads. All of the content in the game can be enjoyed by players regardless of their budget. It is a difficut game to get the hang of and so a discord group has been created by the developer to assist players in progressing through the game and allowing them to socialize with other players.",
            "Lots of bugs. Lacks instruction. I have everything that is says for Hydroponics (something needed for the game) yet fails to let me make it. Do I need to research something fails to tell me in the game. There is no close button when you open menus in the game. Pressing on top where close button should be works. Fun game too bad it's so clunky. Five out of five if you fix the issues...",
            "It's a fun game and I like the idea but the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the UI. It jitters when you switch outposts and doesn't register half my taps, meaning you have to press the button twice for it to do something. Developers, if you're reading this, please improve the UI! Make it less jiterry and clunky and I'll up my review to 5 stars."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

A really nice app and I recommend this for every student. If u feel like a lot of ads are disturbing you, you can just switch off the internet connection. Works with my phone, not sure if it works with yours.ü§î",
            "I'm so happy that you add the feature that you can collect coin in every correct answer and buy another option. The app itself is great buttons are well made, no delay and no lag. Speaking of adds, i don't have problem with it. Speaking of 'tricks' I already mastered some of those and can actually solve mentally. Ps: I just used it for one day. How much more If i use this for so long? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. For developer of this app. I want you all to congratulate for this masterpiece. Gb",
            "1. When you finish a single game, the app shows you how to solve the problem, but it doesn't show what type of problem this solution works for, and instead of the title, the score appears. 2. You can add a solution to the square equation according to Vieta's theorem.",

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I love this app. The Read Aloud function alone is worth the 5 * rating. In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "This game was lots of fun, and my only complaint was the much too frequent adds. However, within the last couple of weeks, the game often freezes up, often in the middle of adjusting my score after a game. Then, I have to shut it down and start over. And, nearly every time it goes to load an ad, it freezes up, as well. Sometimes it simply shuts down by itself. Makes it very frustrating to play, which it never was before. None of the other games by this same company fo this.",
            "I like the game very much! The only thing I hated is the Lazada apps just popped out and blocked my games/takeover the whole game, no matter how I close it; it just keeps coming/doing the interruption. I don't hate ads, but not the one that annoy me, this is the only game I faced this annoying issue! Didn't see in other games I had. Hope these issues can be resolved!",
            "Relaxing after a long day. Keeps my brain rested, yet focused. After playing for awhile, it tires my brain enough so i can sleep well. I wake the next day, feeling sharper, refreshed, and am ready for another long 1. I look forward to playing it, again and again! (Doesn't have many ads in between levels, so that's a bonus+not much lagtime, & 0 purchases necessary to go to as high a level as i want. Very addictive, nice relaxing background graphics+colors, too. I give it 5 stars. üëç)",
            "Great game but holy hell the ads. I don't mind every once in a while like normal games but it's literally after EVERY ROUND. Hard to relax with that. And yes, you can pay for no ads but my point is their placement is such overkill it's super offputting. It also sucks some ads are difficult to click out of because the x to close it is out of the screen view. But i'll still play because it's easy brainless clicking. But the ads are so freaking annoying. So, yeah.",
            "If you like Word Searches, this is for you. It even has nice music! Find the words on the themed list to pass the level. Find all the other small words not on the list, before you finish the list, for extra points. I usually turn off the music on games, but this has delicate, soothing background music, making it nice to play."

            "This game is amazing, I really like how you really have to think about your answers, and not just googling the solutions. I actually learned a couple of things from this game. Like where the inspiration for Frankenstein came from, or the names of some crazy animals like a Trilobite or the Saiga antelope. I just really wanted to say good job! And, I hope you keep making this game even greater.",
            "Best trivia game. It's very enjoyable but can drive you crazy! There are ways around it but I wont give away the game! It's worth the download if you like your knowledge being tested and learn oy ng things you didnt know. There is pretty much no adds. It goes from simple to difficult. And the categories are and number of things. It's not your typical structured trivia game! Its unique and challenging! I love it!",
            "This app is really great. It gets progressively more challenging and I absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!",
            "This game is very abstract and is really simple in design, yet brilliant in its execution. Instead of normal puzzle games where you get stuck and frustrated, you put this game down having learned things you didnt know before! What a great idea, seeking general knowledge should be fun for everyone, to see someone make a game of it deserves some stars, well done!",
            "let me just start with that this is a kinda puzzle game and i highly recommend this game to anyone it is a challenging but fun, it's not something that you just play a couple of levels and put your phone down speaking from personal experience i have had a blast with this game. one of the best mobile games i have ever played. i originally saw this as a youtube ad but there was a part of me that didn't want to skip it what was the plague doctor mask. deserves more than just 5 stars and this review"

And why is this gameü§î called the stupid text it should be called...The smart text,or the intelligent text or something like seriously dude this game is actually Stupid it selfüòù.......ü¶ÑNot ü¶ìtryna to be rude just telling the truth about the gameüòù",

The Stupid Test not only tested me but helped me learn new things. It shows the correct answer in green and the wrong in red, giving me a clear way of knowing the right and wrong choices. Normally I read three star reviews because they are commonly the most honest but PLEASE read this review and take it in to consideration. This app is awesome!",
            "This game goes along with its name. It has super easy questions, so if you miss them, you aren't that bright if you know what I mean. This game desperately needs a new name, though. I saw adds for this game, but never downloaded it because the name made it sound like a foolish, needless game that was not going to be fun. Try some cooler names like How Smart?, or Test Your Knowledge, or something like that. The Stupid Test is a totally awful name.",
            "Great quizzes but there are a few glitches such as, after you answer the last questions of each level, an ad pops up and after that, it shows the 10th question again and if you keep tapping the right answer, at the end you can get a score above 10 out of 10 for example I got a score of 14/10 on level 13.

            "I love this game but they can't seem to deal with all the bugs. I got it when it first came out and played all the time. After all that work I came into the game one day and it had restarted and I lost all my progress. I loved it enough I played through it again. Same issue. That happened a total of 3 times at this point. I've just now given it its last chance and am stuck. It says to click the coin icon which its not allowing me to do. Save yourself from the headache that is this game.",
            "I stoped playing this game earlier ,I decided to play again after watching new review. They still have lot of hackers in game and no policy to control them. one of the worse game by Gameloft. You report them but they don't bother. I have screen shot of many hacker account. You can connect me any time. It is waste to play game any more. Just sharing one hacker details. 8eO62:78eO96 name - M-URAL , 5 hack account in same Faction.",

I tried, by god I tried. So... well done... I tip my hat.",
            "The game is quite good I like it at first the game is very confusing about what to do what not to do the river graphics needs to be realistic there are many complications in this game which need improvement and how do I get to know that how many soldiers I have trained?I want to give this game a 5 star but can't as it needs slight improvement",
            "Seems like a good game,except...it kicks me out of the game (not like back to the home screen,but you know what i mean.) Because i don't have \"Internet Connection.\" I do. It's just fine. Fix this please. This game has great potential,when this game doesn't have that problem i will install it again"

Ps. I'm stuck at $8.99. Pps. For all people out there criticising the game, please don't play this game bcs you want to earn, play this bcs you want to learn. üòâ",
            "I play this for 3 days ago then i stuck on $8.53 dollars, every time you spin you have a minimal chance to get a dollar. Then i was lucky to won a $10 on a spin but it ended up giving you a 2 pass. This is a scam. I am telling you right now, don't waste your time by playing game.",
            "I love this game at first but when i reached $8.52, I'm not getting any cash rewards anymore. I tried everyday but there's no progress. I'm only getting pass and coins.",
            "Waste of time. People play to earn nowadays. I think its really programmed that once you almost reached $10 you will keep on receiving coins, so its very difficult to cash out on this game just like the other reviews.",
            "The game was fun. Super fun but the thing is there is so many ads. Also when you are close on cashing out, it will give you minimal amount to add up on your account. I would suggest that give atleast something that the user will hold on to when in terms in cashing out. Daily reward could be atleast 0.02 $ so that the user will still be in-game. That is all, thank you!"

            "Fixed game. Very disappointing! The developer says that the distribution of pieces is random. Bull! After you get to a certain score, you'll never get a diagonal pattern in the initial distribution. Later, if you need pieces going vertically, you're given horizontal ones, if you need one going to the left, you only get pieces to the right. If I had this kind of luck in Vegas, if never go back, but even there they throw you a bone every once in a while! It's not just me, either. My wife and frien",
            "This game is awesome. Super addictive, however, it would be nice if the game didn't deal me the exact opposite of a set if blocks i need. Feels like you're playing against \"the house\". It's bad enough that i play frequently, and i see the pattern. \"Here's the perfect block for you\" but you can't use it cuz its rotated or flipped the exact opposite way it's needed. Fix this and i could mindlessly play but it's starting to get boring. 5 star awesome game to keep your mind busy otherwise",
            "Min 8 sec on only 1 or 2 adds before X shows. Then 30 or more on the rest. You need to correct this Fun game. But when the ads last longer than the game itself (after every game) and pop up ads while playing is incredibly STUPID! Takes the enjoyment out of the game. Edit, I am even getting push notifications now. Started right after I made this review!",
            "This is a fun game but you should make it where we can rotate the pieces. Otherwise it's almost impossible to get very far. I'm uninstalling for now and will check back in the future to see if you change that feature. Till then there are other tetris type games that let you rotate.",
            "I think this game would get a lot better if it had the option to store a piece rather than forced to play it. Just one piece like Tetris. Else wise it sets you up to lose. It addicting to try and beat your own score but it'll be frustrating at times."

And what if cancer is riddled the entire body bone structure the whole skeleton I would like to see details of that I would like to be able to ask questions and have them answered. I know that's a lot.",
            "I can see clearly how things work now, suggestion... the animation of the lungs isn't clear because it is covered by muscle. Also please show how the circulatory system flows throughout the body. Other than that, great job.",
            "Very less information.... and details, I would give it 5 stars, if you do some work on its anotomy also. like giving cross-section of interal organs and mentioning it's details. It's really very basic app. I think it's for primary school students. It is not at all useful for college students.",
            "It is really helpful for the beginners. My younger brother had learned all the organs so quickly bcoz of this app. I'm very much satisfied with this app. Thnkq so much for making such an amazing app. üòä‚ù£",
            "It's pretty good, but has some obvious things missing: Full system is only viewable for male anatomy. I thought at one point you could overlay outer body so you could see where the organs are, but I can't see it now. The animation for digestion really just shows through the colon, not the whole system. The demarcation between large and small intestine is unclear.. would be nice to be able to see how they interact."

            "I like the game enought but has a flaw, the key system, when you finish them i don't understand how ti recharge. This make It very difficult for new players to grow, because without keys you don't erarn coins or xp. I Hope who you make the key system more accessible (like for opening the booty when you don't have keys you must see an advertisement). For the rest the game is beautiful.",
            "In-game currency is garbage takes to long to earn currency. You should be able to receive rewards after every battle not have to use a key to get the rewards. This is basically a pay to win game. The gameplay was alright, but you should not have to re-buy your defenses once you have been attacked. In my opinion this game makes no sense.",
            "Its a great game , i like the controls and the upgrade system is cool but becomes a grind quick , i dislike that everything gets destroyed when it is attacked , lets say the light turret it gets attack boom can not be used , its a cool balancing system to prevent someone from spending no gold but for certain things like vehicles ,turrets , heli towers , tracker groups i wish you could repair them for 1/4 or 1/3 of the original cost. But for other traps and defences like mines ,gysers it breaks",
            "I would have rated it higher, but the key system has to go. It basically turns what is otherwise a beautiful game into a pay to win slot-machine, which is disgusting to me. My advice is to remove the key system immediately or you will lose players.",
            "I love the game it's really fun but the problem is not all of the defenses are in the shop. This means that if u lose them they are gone forever. This is a big problem especially for trackers (squads of troopers that hunt the enemy) because they die a lot. We need the trackers back in the shop. This problem also applies to sniper towers and some other defenses"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

Whether you want to improve your general brain health and memory[1][2], enhance your problem solving abilities[3], reduce your risk of Parkinson‚Äôs or Alzheimer‚Äôs[4][5][6][7], or bend metal and shoot lasers with your mind ‚Äì exercise has an important role to play in all but two of those activities. In particular, richer fitness regimens ‚Äì regimens consisting of aerobic and resistance training methods[8][1], produce the greatest overall improvements in cognitive performance and neurochemical brain processes. Note, however, working out for sixteen hours each day won‚Äôt turn you into the next Stephen Hawking. There are diminishing returns[9], and the favorable cerebral environment promoted by exercise is only as good as the active learning that accompanies it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that exercise has been found to improve a wide range of general health conditions[15][16][17][18][19][20][21], so too does it have wide and positive impacts across the brain. Its effects extend across vascular[22][23], metabolic[24][25], inflammatory[26] [24] and stress-regulating[27] pathways as they exist in the brain. Exercise has been shown to enhance neuronal metabolic and mitochondrial functioning[28][25], decrease oxidative stress in the hippocampus[29][27], and increase mitochondrial machinery[28]. Another way of saying this: working out helps improve the power supply, the work environment and workers themselves in neuronal ‚Äòtrain stations.‚Äô On the other end, stress, and chronic stress in particular, has been linked to impaired functioning of, and indeed damage to, the hippocampus[27]. Exercise has shown favorable benefits in the regulation of stress (and in particular the management of corticosteroid processes ‚Äì e.g. cortisol)[27], and may also favorably affect hippocampal memory systems through this process (also potentially leading to improvements in mood and attention if not intelligence). \r\n\r\nMore specific to the process of memory formation and the underlying neuronal structure, exercise has been found to increase levels of hippocampal neurotrophins[32]. Neurotrophins are a class of growth factors centrally important in the development and health of neurons[33]. In particular, increases in a neurotrophin called brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been linked to neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) and improved synaptic plasticity[32][24] [34], producing substantial improvements in memory[24]. In turn, exercise has been found to up-regulate levels of hippocampal BDNF[34]- and much of its impact on memory appears to stem from this process[35]. To make a wild analogy and a gross, but potentially useful, simplification ‚Äì BDNF is to neurogenesis as testosterone is to muscle growth. \r\n\r\nInsulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is another compound which has been found to enhance neurogenesis and plasticity processes[36][37], and it is similarly upregulated through working out[38][39][40]. Not only does strenuous physical activity lead to positive increases in these compounds, but it can also help regulate hormones which indirectly support them. Active fitness workouts have been shown to help maintain levels of testosterone and estrogen[41][42], which have also been shown to help favorably regulate levels of neurotrophins and neurogenesis [43][44][45][41]. Taken together, the neuronal and synaptic plasticity promoted by these compounds ultimately work to facilitate some of the basic processes of cognition, learning and memory formation such as Long Term Potentiation, or ‚ÄòLTP. Exercise appears to have has favorable effects on LTP [46][47][48], most likely mediated by its positive effects on synaptic plasticity generally.\r\n\r\nTo see more on how physical activity impacts cognitive fitness, mood, attention and intelligence see http://www.bodbot.com/Cognitive_Health.html",

            "It's a fun way to build your vocabulary.The negatives are: your opponent can take 4 or 5 days before playing their move which is frustrating but more frustrating is the amount of people who think it is an online dating game. Try to chat you up but as soon as you say you're not interested they then don't play the game leaving you having to wait for them to expire. You should be able to close the game without being penalised",
            "I love this game is it's a lot of fun, but there is a down side. Most of the guys that play, not all, most, all they want is chat dirty. This is a game to play and have fun not a dating site. And if you won't talk dirty with them they resign after a few plays. That's the down side. Luckily there are more people who just want to have fun. There needs to be a way to report the dirt.",
            "Although this game has some glitches, overall it's a great Scrabble experience that is fun to play. However, the most recent update has caused the game to crash immediately on the first or second loading screen. Occasionally it makes it to the main screen, whereupon it crashes as soon as I try to click on any of my ongoing Scrabble games in progress. Since it is now totally unusable, I have moved on. Hopefully the developers can fix it in the next version update.",
            "BEWARE ! Once you ask to play with one player from your contact list, your entire contact list will be visible. Asking them to remove your contact list and you get no where. I am still asking. I got a response but useless. Contact list still on here. I had to uninstall the game and reinstall under new gaming name, losing all my points that I bought BUT my contact list is gone.",
            "The game app is STILL freezing due to an \"ANR input dispatching timed out\" programming error. I send reports daily to the game programmer but still no fix in sight. NOT HAPPY. Previously - While I LOVE this game I am letting my opponents down by abandoning games due to all the loading freezes. At the very least, put a banner up telling ALL PLAYERS that some users are experiencing difficulties & game play has been interrupted. It's the right thing to do. Where is this promised update? UGH!"

I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals.

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get itüòä",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "This app is perfect especially for mental maths. I first installed it 3 years ago and since I was only eight I found some things quite challenging but now it's perfect. The best thing is that you can practice without a certain time limit and also just time yourself. This is perfect for developing mental maths as well as written maths! Another great feature is that it can explain to you how to do something. Not as in explaining questions but when you go to the learn mode it shows how to do things. I am just a bit disappointed that it isn‚Äôt available on IOS because I have now completely switched all devices in my house to Apple and this app is only available on Android. I‚Äôve emailed the app developers about this issue so hopefully it‚Äôll be fixed.",

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a üåü from me."

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

            "The app is really nice for your brain. But I am always struggling with the multiplayer system. You see, whenever I try challenging other people/players again for a battletext, they don't respond. But I didnt care‚Äì so for the first time in forever, I got the chance for me and my sister to use battletext for challenging eachother! So after me winning all the time, she left‚Äì I tapped challenge to play with my sister again, but she told me that she havent recieved a notification to challenge me.",
            "This game is brilliant. It makes you enhance your vocabulary in a time limit and pressures you into thinking of longer words I mean, it does let you do the same word again but it gives you a bonus if you use new words. Plus, you can play it with your friends! This game should add new modes but otherwise the performance was great, game idea great to fit a modern generation and I recommend this to help you with vocabulary and english classes!",
            "This game is a masterpiece!! I love the concept, and the gameplay is amazing! One thing though.. everytime I close the app, I can't open it back up. When I try, it crashes. But other than that, GREAT GAME!",
            "This is awesome but you should remove the autocomplete and keep it in another place cuz when I type in my word and try to click enter I will click on autocompletes by mistake and I've wasted so many autocompletes like that.",
            "Really fun game! It gets only 3 stars due to the fact that the \"autocomplete\" button is right next to the send button. I missclick all the time. So when I already finished my word and I'm about to send it I accidentally click auto complete and I don't even get any extra points. And I'm always out of auto completes. Please fix this, it's very annoying."

            "So promising, I'm disappointed to uninstal but it's unusable. For example, on one question after BOTH hints I knew it was 12 letters. Even online crossword solvers couldn't suggest, and there's no way to skip, you must restart (to re-randomise) or quit. Ads freeze repeatedly (never seen this in any other app); I tapped X and then \"Resume\" up to six times in 20 secs. A \"success\" screen must be closed manually after every question. Overall, too much interruption in a mediocre user experience.",
            "Poor, cannot see the logic of how they came up with some of their answers. Even with hints you have to think so far outside the box that it just becomes boring. And then you have to pay if you want the solution (with no explanation i believe), no thanks. Shame as could've been good.",
            "Its idea is pretty nice, but i have no reason to love it or to have the passion of challenge, it is too motionless, it needs better interface, and more encouraging graphical tools and parts I uninstalled it for now waiting until a better design is released üòÅ",
            "This game has many good riddles but you need to have wifi always on.. the ads are extremely too many and if you close the window and reopen it there is no way to get an appointment internet connection to pass the next level..",
            "Not your usual easy game. Some of the answers are ridiculously easy of course that is not the case as you progress, this is a great game where you have to actually think to get the answer."

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

Yeah, I can't leave my city until level 9, but I can't get to level 9 until I finish the tutorial, but to continue with the tutorial, I have to leave the city.

            "Playing through the first game, I found it fun, but I made several errors. Upon completion, the scoring system gave me \"100% accuracy\", which, unless this is a sense of the word \"accurate\" of which I am unaware, I feel cannot be correct. So, starting off with no confidence in the scoring system is discouraging. Providing the user with a way to access the details of their score would be helpful. It displays well on a full-sized screen.",
            "Ok, but limited. 1. The one where you assign categories only has 8 categories. Sometimes, a word can be in two categories, but the app doesn't know that. Example - \"alarm\", can be on a car or a feeling. No context, so you don't know it wants \"feeling\". 2. And no way to find correct answer on the timed tests so you can't learn. 3. Random order needs tweaking. A couple of times I got the same question twice in a row. 4. I have sound turned off. Ads don't acknowlegde that setting. I HATE that.",
            "I upgraded to the Pro Pack, yet the app won't let me play some of the games I've use up my trial. I get a message that I need to upgrade to the Pro Pack, which I already have done. Also, there are a few punctuation and spelling glitches that need to be corrected. The individual game are fun and challenging, but the problems work the app are very frustrating.",
            "It's a good little challenge game to keep the brain going. However it isn't really designed to teach, all it really accomplished is to say how quick you can provide an answer it doesn't provide ways to expand your knowledge base. Was hoping for more then that.",
            "This excellent game challenges the brain to think fast, expand vocabulary, sort out prefixes, suffixes, and combine parts of root words to form common yet underused words."

            "I don't like that it can't handle minor grammatical errors and that you have to type the word \"muscle\" after the name of each muscle for it to mark it as correct. it's such a waste of time. The ranking system is unnecessary and it would be good if you could opt out. Other useful information that I need to learn include the origin, insertion and innervation for each muscle. I'd love an app that included those",
            "It is a very accurate with the information. Though, I would prefer if you could look in to making it possable for the app to explain or give a mini lesson to a wrong answer for the quizzes. Because as a learning student, it is some times better to explain a mistake. Then to just get it wrong and not understand why your answer is would. Thank you for your time in reading this and hope you will consider the though.",
            "Great challenges. Excellent way to learn anatomy. I love this.",
            "Very good app with excellent pictures. Many times score at end is wrong. eg. get everything correct and it says 16 out of 30 or whatever. very happy with it overall. great for learning all the body parts when you have a few mins here and there with your phone.",
            "This app has given me the stupid wrong answer glitch at least 20 times in 15 minutes, saying that it was the wrong answer, though it was clearly the correct one. It also spams \"Go To Ranking\" in my face all the time. It also asks me to pay for certain lessons, which I might even think about if the app wasn't broken. The typing version also has a glitch which does not allow me to move on and it even crashed my computer. I would not rate the app as a one star but I would rate my experience as one"

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

        "comments": [
            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened üòî. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."
